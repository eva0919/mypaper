Xiaomi Inc., the Chinese smartphone maker that has overtaken Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in the world's biggest smartphone market, has hired another former Google Inc. executive, this time to lead its products team in India.
Jai Mani, who joins as lead product manager, was strategy and analytics associate for Google Play and co-founded a startup, according to his LinkedIn profile, before relocating from San Francisco.
"You can think of it as the beginning of our R&D center development in India," Hugo Barra, vice president for global operations at Xiaomi, said.
"The first person we hired is someone who's going to be the glue between our users in India, product feedback that we receive, and the engineering team we have in Beijing as well as the engineering team that we are going to be building fairly soon in India," he said.
Mr. Barra, who also joined Xiaomi from Google, said he and Mr. Mani "worked very closely at Google."
The appointment comes as Xiaomi is expanding outside of China and ramping up its presence in India and Southeast Asia. The Chinese company wants to build products or applications that run on its cellphones aimed at a global audience from India, Mr. Barra told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. Xiaomi, which means "little rice" in Chinese, has intensified competition in a smartphone market dominated by Apple and Samsung. Xiaomi has created buzz in China and India by selling high-end phones online directly to consumers for prices that are close to cost. The company offers services such as mobile applications and movies via its software and makes money by selling an array of accessories. Mr. Mani worked with Google from 2009 until 2013.
