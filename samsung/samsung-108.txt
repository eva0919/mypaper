SINGAPORE, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The Asian naphtha crack rose
slightly from a 27-month low on Tuesday to $59.18 a tonne, with
a lower Brent price and spot demand giving a temporary lift to
an over-supplied market, traders said.
    South Korea's Samsung Total bought a full-range naphtha
cargo for first-half December delivery at a discount wider than
$13 a tonne to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis,
they said. 
    The steep discounts reflected the level of oversupply in
Asia, where prices are rarely in the negative zone because the
region is usually short of the feedstock. 
    This changed in August after the West, including Europe and
the Mediterranean lined up a massive amount of cargoes to be
shipped to the East. 
    The situation could deteriorate further for sellers, traders
said, as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is expanding its Ruwais
refinery which is due to be completed soon. UAE's naphtha
exports are expected to increase. 
    The weak market has weighed on sellers all over Asia.
    Bangladesh Petroleum Corp (BPC) offered 170,000 barrels for
Nov. 27-29 loading from Chittagong for the second time after
receiving low bids in its earlier offer, said a BPC official. 
    The new tender will close on Nov. 17, with bids to stay
valid until Nov. 17. 
    
    TENDERS: Thailand's IRPC offered 30,000 tonnes of heavy
naphtha for Dec. 5-28 loading from Rayong in a tender closing on
Oct. 31. 
    India's Essar Oil offered 35,000 tonnes of naphtha for Nov.
23-27 loading from Vadinar in a tender closing on Oct. 30. 
    Egypt, which has a quarterly contract ending December with
Total, has offered similar volumes but for Dec. 22-24 loading
from Suez in a tender closing on Nov. 10. 
    Indonesia's Pertamina was seeking 100,000 barrels of
92-octane gasoline for Nov. 8-10 delivery to Tanjung Gerem and
another 100,000 barrels for Nov. 13-15 arrival at Jakarta in a
tender closing on Oct. 30. 
    SINGAPORE CASH DEALS: One deal each on naphtha and gasoline.
    Vitol sold to PTT a 92-octane gasoline cargo for Nov. 23-27
loading from Singapore at a premium of $1.40 a barrel to
Singapore quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis. 
    Vitol, on the other hand, bought a first-half January
naphtha cargo from Sietco at $711 a tonne.
