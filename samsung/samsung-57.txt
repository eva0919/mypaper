<title:>BUZZ-ARM: sharp reversal sees stock at bottom of FTSE
<Date:>21 October 2014
<Content:>
** ARM Holdings breaks sharply lower, cracks below last week's lows on heavy volume after outlook disappoints and good results from Apple does little to arrest recent weakness .
** Stock slumps to 15-1/2 month lows and is worst performing stock on the FTSE 100 despite a bright start to the trading day.
** Booming sales at Apple, which uses ARM designs in its iPhone 6, gave stock initial leg-up, but slowing demand for high-end smartphones from the likes of Samsung Electronics a worry.
** Strategists at SocGen flagged "underwhelming" guidance for Q4.
** Stock, which saw brief stint as top FTSE 100 gainer on the day, down more than 8 pct, on course for its biggest one-day pct drop in more than three years. UK benchmark up 1.3 pct. (RM:tricia.wright1.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net,)
