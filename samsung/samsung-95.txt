SEOUL, Oct 13 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank is
expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday for the second time
in three months in a further bid to re-energize an underpowered
economic recovery, a Reuters survey found on Monday.
    Of 30 analysts polled, 18 forecast the Bank of Korea would
cut its seven-day base rate at its meeting on
Wednesday. Six of the remaining 12 expect the central bank to
cut rates in November instead of this month, after third-quarter
GDP data due on Oct. 24 is published.
    "The central bank isn't viewing growing household debt as a
serious problem and some board members showed signs they could
vote to cut rates further in last month's minutes," said Kim
Jina, a fixed-income analyst at IBK Securities. 
    "The Bank of Korea will likely cut the growth forecast and
rates on Wednesday," Kim said.
    A downgrade is expected when the Bank of Korea releases the 
latest economic growth forecast on Wednesday, after Bank of
Korea Gov. Lee Ju-yeol said last week that growth is expected to
be in the mid-3 percent range this year.
    The central bank currently forecasts the economy will grow
3.8 percent this year and 4.0 percent the next. 
    Regardless of their view on the rate decision this week,
most economists agreed if the Bank of Korea decides to lower
rates again, it would be under further pressure from the
government, as was seen to be the case with the August cut.
    Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan has not explicitly
discussed the future direction of interest rates in public but
has repeated that the economy is still weak and the ongoing
recovery is slow. 
    The minister also reiterated on the sidelines of a series of
international meetings over the weekend in the United States
that there was "little difference" between the government and
central bank in their understanding of the economic situation.
    "Right now the main driving force behind the bond market is
Choi. If the central bank doesn't cut this week it'll do it
within the year," said Shin Eol, a fixed-income analyst at
Hyundai Securities.
    "Even after a second rate cut, pressure to align policy with
the government will still live on," Shin said.
    Bond yields have steadily drifted down in recent weeks on
expectations for another rate cut. The 1-year treasury bond
yield ended Friday's session at 2.164 points,
roughly 10 basis points lower than the policy rate.
    Meanwhile, recent economic indicators have been mixed, as
manufacturers reported a decline in export orders in September
while inflation hit a seven-month low last month, giving the
central bank room to cut interest rates further.
    Exports in September grew at their fastest pace in nine
months, while imports rose at their quickest since early 2012.
Housing prices across South Korea have been on a steady rise,
growing for a 13th month in September thanks to an easing in 
regulation and low interest rates.
    All but one of the 18 analysts who saw a rate cut this week
said the base rate would be lowered by 25 basis points, while
the remaining analyst said the central bank would shave off 10
basis points.
