Hong Kong shares rose as the government and student protesters continued to seek a format for talks, while Japanese shares slid amid a weaker dollar.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.5% to 23422.52, advancing for a third consecutive session.
Brokerage IG said working conditions in Hong Kong are returning to normal, but the cost of the protests won't be known until trade-balance numbers and other activity gauges are released in early November.
Banks and property developers with strong exposure to the territory were mixed.
Chong Hing Bank jumped 4.5%, Standard Chartered climbed 2.4%, and Hang Seng Bank rose 1.4%, while developer New World Development improved by 1.3% and Cheung Kong (Holdings) moved up 1.1%.
However, Sino-British banking giant HSBC Holdings dipped 0.1%, and Henderson Land Development edged down 0.2%.
Most Hong Kong retailers rebounded further, with jeweler Luk Fook Holdings International advancing 2.5%, rival Chow Sang Sang Holdings International rising 0.5%, and clothing retailer I.T Ltd. adding 0.8%.
In Japan, the Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.7% to 15783.83 as the dollar weakened. Among exporters, industrial robot maker Fanuc slipped 1.1%, air-conditioner maker Daikin Industries fell 1.9% and auto maker Fuji Heavy Industries lost 1.4%.
The Bank of Japan said it would maintain its position on monetary policy, as expected.
Elsewhere, Korea's Kospi closed up 0.2% at 1972.91.
Samsung Electronics rose as much as 3% in early trading in Seoul after the company forecast that its third-quarter operating profit more than halved from a year earlier. Samsung's shares had already been battered on expectations weak smartphone sales would hit profit. The shares closed up 1%.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.2% to 5284.20.
Rio Tinto was up 4.3% in Sydney, after the company said it rejected a takeover proposal by Glencore because it wasn't in the best interest of shareholders. The possible takeover inspired a rally in large mining stocks. BHP Billiton rose 1.7% and Fortescue Metals Group added 4.2%.
That wasn't enough, however, to outweigh broad-based declines among banks and retailers.
India's Sensex was down 1.1% at 26271.97.
