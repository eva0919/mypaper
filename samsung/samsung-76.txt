SINGAPORE, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Asia's front-month first-half December naphtha crack fell 14
percent to $64.35 a tonne on Thursday weighed down by stock piles. 
    Spot prices of cargoes going into North Asia sold at steep discounts while naphtha streaming
out of the India was sold at levels not seen in more than five years despite demand from
petrochemical makers. 
    Japan's Mitsui Chemicals joined others including South Korea's Lotte Chemical, S-Oil Corp,
Samsung Total and Taiwan's Formosa to purchase second-half November cargoes this week. It paid
discounts of $12 to $13 per tonne to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis. 
    JG Summit of the Philippines was also looking to buy a November cargo. 
    "Demand is still there but supplies have increased," said a trader, adding that cargoes
coming to Asia from Europe and the Mediterranean have outpaced demand. 
    India's Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) on the other hand sold a naphtha
cargo to Mercuria for Nov. 22-24 loading from New Mangalore at about $1 a tonne above Middle
East quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis. 
    A few months back, MRPL was still selling some of its April, May and June spot cargoes at
premiums in the $40s a tonne level, Reuters data showed. 
    
    OTHER TENDERS: Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) sold two naphtha cargoes for November loading
with traders saying that the cargoes could have been bought by Shell and Trafigura. 
    But this could not be confirmed as the parties do not comment on their deals. 
    GASOLINE CRACK AT A WEEK'S HIGH
    The Asian gasoline crack rose to reach a week's high of $11.18 a barrel on firm Indonesian
demand as Asia's top importer has yet to restart some of its refinery units following planned
maintenance which started in September. 
    Pertamina has started maintenance at some of the units in its Cilacap and Balikpapan
refineries last month. 
    The Singapore onshore stocks also pointed to a drawdown as  weekly inventories fell 7.3
percent to reach a two-week low of 11.229 million barrels in the week to Oct. 15, official data
showed. 
    
    SINGAPORE CASH DEALS: One naphtha deal and one on gasoline. 
    Shell sold a 92-octane gasoline cargo for Nov. 5-9 loading at $94.20 a barrel. 
    Shell also sold a naphtha cargo for second-half December delivery to Socar at $691 a tonne.
