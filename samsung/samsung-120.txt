    SEOUL, Oct 28 (Reuters) - South Korean shares were trading
slightly lower on Tuesday morning after a choppy session as
investors waited on the sidelines ahead of the U.S Federal
Reserve's two-day policy meeting ending on Wednesday.    
    The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was
down 0.2 percent at 1,928.10 points as of 0155 GMT. 
    Data indicating a slowdown in the U.S. services sector,
which dipped to a six-month low in October, as well as weak
German business sentiment also put downward pressure on
equities. 
    The Fed is expected to announce the end of its quantitative
easing program when its meeting concludes, but analysts say it
is a foregone conclusion and don't expect markets to react
significantly.
    "We believe stocks will rally, having already priced in
concerns in September and October... and while liquidity was
almost the only concern after QE1 and QE2, economic conditions
and earnings are now also being considered," said Samsung
Securities in a note to clients.
    "With other nations turning to stimulus, global liquidity
levels should remain solid even after QE3 finishes."
    Oil refiners were battered as crude prices plumbed fresh
two-year lows, with Goldman Sachs cutting its price target of
West Texas Intermediate from $94.83 per barrel this year to
dd$73.75 in 2015.
    SK Innovation, South Korea's largest refiner,
fell 2.1 percent while S-Oil tumbled 3.3 percent.
    Defensive sectors such as telecoms bucked broader trends, as
SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile services
provider, rose 2.4 percent while KT Corp gained 2.4
percent. 
    Samsung Life Insurance shares were trading 1.4
percent higher while Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance 
added 1.9 percent after Samsung Group said its conglomerate
heir-apparent Jay Y. Lee was looking to acquire a stake in the
two insurance arms. 
    The South Korean won was a shade higher on Tuesday as
investors, braced for more dovish comments from the Federal
Reserve, turned bearish on the dollar.
    The currency was quoted at 1,050.7 to the dollar
as of 0155 GMT, compared to Monday's closing rate of 1,052.2.
    December futures on three-year treasury bonds shed 3
basis points to trade at 108.83.
