* Singapore likely to keep tight monetary policy
    * Won up on China data, stop-loss dollar selling
 (Adds text, updates prices)
    By Jongwoo Cheon
    SINGAPORE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The Singapore dollar led gains
among emerging Asian currencies on Monday, as solid China trade
data eased concerns over a slowing global economy and the U.S.
dollar slid on dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials.
    Singapore's dollar advanced as the central bank is
expected to maintain its tight monetary policy on Tuesday.
 
    China's exports in September grew more than market
expectations while imports surprisingly expanded, alleviating
worries about deteriorating domestic demand in the world's
second-largest economy. 
    The greenback slid against a basket of six-major
currencies after several Fed officials on Friday said a sluggish
global economy could delay U.S. interest rate hikes if the
slowdown is serious enough. 
    Still, Asian shares fell to seven-month lows, indicating
investors stayed concerned over faltering global growth. That
will keep putting pressure on regional currencies, analysts
said.
    "The near-term bias for Asian currencies is likely to remain
skewed towards further weakness," said Jonathan Cavenagh, senior
FX strategist with Westpac in a client note.
    "Global equity market sentiment has softened noticeably and
this creates the risks of further equity market outflows from
the region." 
    
    SINGAPORE DOLLAR
    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will likely stick
to its stance of allowing a "moderate and gradual" appreciation
of the Singapore dollar as core inflation has picked up, a
Reuters poll showed last week. 
    That comes even as the city-state's economy has slowed on a
sluggish manufacturing sector and weak exports.
    "They still have adequate room to allow the index to drift
into the weak end of the band without officially changing their
stance," said Emmanuel Ng, a foreign exchange strategist for
OCBC Bank in Singapore, referring to the Singapore dollar
nominal effective exchange rate.
    The MAS is set to announce its semi-annual policy decision
at 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Tuesday.
    
    WON
    The won started local trade weaker, dampened by concerns
over a slowing global economy.
    The South Korean unit turned firmer on stop-loss dollar
selling and after solid China trade data eased worries over the
global economic outlook. China is South Korea's top overseas
market.
    Samsung Heavy Industries Co LTD said it had won
a 664 billion won ($622.1 million) ship order, prompting
expectations of more won demand. 
    "We may see further stop-loss dollar offers, so the won may
head to 1,065," said a foreign bank trader in Seoul.
