BANGALORE, India¡XXiaomi Inc., China¡¦s best-selling cellphone maker, is thinking of manufacturing its handsets in India.
The company¡Xwhich sells more smartphones than even Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. in China¡Xjust started selling its phones in India in July. Its early sales figures have been strong enough that it is already considering manufacturing in Asia¡¦s third-largest economy, said Manu Jain, the head of Xiaomi¡¦s Indian arm.
¡§We always thought that our manufacturing would be based out of China,¡¨ Mr. Jain said. ¡§But India is beginning to become so important for us that we started to think whether we should set up our own manufacturing.¡¨
Mr. Jain said it would take at least six months before Xiaomi can decide whether making handsets in India makes sense.
Earlier this month Nokia Corp. decided to suspend manufacturing at its cellphone factory in southern India amid a continuing dispute with the country¡¦s tax authorities. The tax battle prevented Nokia from selling the plant¡Xonce one of the Finnish company¡¦s largest factories¡Xto Microsoft Corp.
Xiaomi has hired legal advisers to investigate the regulatory aspects of manufacturing in India, said Mr. Jain.
Xiaomi has been making waves in the India cellphone market using sudden online sales and high-end handsets priced close to cost. In its four months in India, Xiaomi has already sold more than 500,000 phones in India.
That is still only a small slice of the market in India where more than 200 million cellphones are sold each year, making it the world¡¦s second largest market after China¡¦s.
While only around one fifth of the new phones sold in India are smartphones, Mr. Jain expects smartphones to account for a majority of the phones sold in the South Asian nation the next three years.
