    By Jongwoo Cheon
    SINGAPORE, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Most emerging Asian currencies
rose on Wednesday as the dollar eased on expectations that the
U.S. Federal Reserve will reaffirm its intention to wait longer
before hiking interest rates.
    South Korea's won hit a one-month-high as Seoul
shares rallied, and on expectations of exporters' demand
from month-end settlements.
    The currency pared some gains as caution grew over possible
intervention to stem its strength as President Park Geun-hye
said she was concerned about the impact of a weaker yen.
Some traders suspected dollar bids from the authorities.
    The Malaysian ringgit advanced as investors cut
long dollar positions.
    The Fed is expected to announce the end of its bond-buying
programme when it concludes a two-day policy meeting later on
Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is unlikely to flag a rise in
interest rates soon due to slow global growth and low inflation.
 
    Emerging Asian currencies have priced in such expectations
and investors may hesitate to chase regional units, especially
on sustained concerns over slowing growth in major economies,
analysts said.
    "A dovish Fed may support Asia FX further. Still, I doubt
how much more they can strengthen from here unless Europe and
China economies improve," said Jeong My-young, Samsung Futures'
research head in Seoul.
    
    WON
    The won rose as much as 0.4 percent to 1,045.6 per dollar,
its strongest since Sept. 26.
    South Korea's central bank views exports as faring well
despite the won's relative strength to currencies of its trading
partners, a Bank of Korea official said earlier. 
    The local currency pared some of its earlier gains as Park
said the economy faces the risk of falling into a long-term
slump, citing low growth, low inflation and a softer yen. South
Korean and Japanese companies compete head-on for a similar
group of products on major markets around the world.
    Against the yen, the won gained 0.2 percent to
9.6608, its strongest since Oct. 6.
    Traders hesitated to chase the won further, seeing chart
resistance around 1,043 per dollar.
    It has a 200-day moving average at 1,043.1 and the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement at 1,043.0 of its depreciation
between September and October.
    Some analysts saw "good chances" to buy the won against the
dollar on dips with stops below 1,038.    
    
    RINGGIT
    The ringgit gained in thin trading as investors cut dollar
holdings on expectations that the Fed will take a dovish stance.
    The Malaysian currency also advanced against the
neighbouring Singapore dollar.
