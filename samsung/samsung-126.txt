SEOUL, Oct 27 (Reuters) - South Korean shares and the won
 were buoyed by returning risk appetite on positive
earnings results and economic data that soothed concerns over
the health of the global economy.
    The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was up
0.3 percent at 1,932.03 points as of 0200 GMT while the local
currency was up half a percent at 1,052.1 against the
dollar.
    "The KOSPI is likely to try to firmly rebound this week as
sentiment is expected to keep improving. Whether it will be able
to move safely above the 1,940 level will be closely watched,"
said Lee Kyung-min, an analyst at Daishin Securities.
    U.S. data released late on Friday showed sales of new U.S.
homes rose to a six-year high in September while third-quarter
GDP growth in Britain remained above the country's long-run
average and on track to outpace other advanced economies this
year.  
    Investors also took heart in positive earnings results from
blue chips Microsoft and Proctor & Gamble, which
propped up U.S. stocks to close out their best week in nearly
two years on Friday.
    Market participants will now look towards Wednesday, when
the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meeting this week ends and
where it is likely to announce the end of its bond-buying
programme.
    Shares of Samsung Heavy and Samsung Engineering
 both gained more than 3 percent after it was
announced shareholders approved the merger of the two companies.
 
    Foreign investors purchased a net 26.7 billion Korean
won($25.38 million) worth of KOSPI shares near mid-session,
propping up the index.
    The KOSPI 200 benchmark of core stocks was up 0.4 
percent, while the junior KOSDAQ was nearly flat up 0.1
percent.
    December futures on three-year treasury bonds ticked
down 0.01 points to trade at 107.89.
