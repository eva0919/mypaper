SEOUL, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Cheil Industries Inc, the de facto holding company for Samsung Group, plans for its IPO to be worth between 1.3 trillion won and 1.5 trillion won ($1.2 billion to $1.4 billion), a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.
Preliminary plans call for shareholders to sell around 18.74 million shares while 10 million new shares will be issued, and for an indicative price range of 45,000 won to 53,000 won per share, the source said.
The source declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak about the matter.
