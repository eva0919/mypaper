NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Hewlett-Packard's plan to split in two leaves it just 10 percent undervalued and looking for a future. Over the past three years, Chief Executive Meg Whitman has boosted the tech conglomerate and its stock by refraining from acquisitions, paying off debt and firing employees. Spinning off its PC and printer business should close the firm's stubborn conglomerate discount. But the harder part - avoiding obsolescence - still awaits resolution.
Though the company's PC and printing businesses are cash cows, their future is bleak. PC sales have stabilized after years of decline, but tablets may renew their assault on the market, and computer prices will continue to fall. Meanwhile, the growth of mobile devices and internet services give consumers fewer reasons to print stuff out. HP sold about $32 billion of computers last year and $24 billion of printers and ink. Put these on the sales multiples of Lenovo and Lexmark, and the two are worth almost $9 billion and $15 billion respectively.
HP's remaining operations are more promising. Its enterprise group sold about $28 billion of storage and servers. Put that on the same multiple as rival NetApp, and it would be worth about $41 billion. The enterprise software business, with $4 billion of revenue, has a value of perhaps $12 billion based on the valuations achieved by peers. And HP's troubled services business is worth maybe $6 billion based on rival Unisys . Add it all up, subtract $5 billion of net debt, and HP should be worth about $78 billion - or more than 10 percent higher than its current market cap.
That's encouraging, but financial engineering and Whitman's other efforts don't address HP's more existential problem. It has missed big technological shifts, such as mobile, hardware virtualization, and cloud computing. Sales should shrink again this year, both across the company and in most divisions. Cutting costs has delivered profits, but their size and durability must be taken with a grain of salt - HP has had exceptional charges for at least 20 quarters in a row.
Splitting the company should create two more nimble operators who are less prone to squander the next big opportunities that come along. That's the company's biggest hope. Unfortunately for shareholders, few companies - big or small - ever leap to the edge of new technologies once they've fallen far behind.
