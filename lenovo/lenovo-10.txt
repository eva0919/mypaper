BEIJING, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd said on Thursday it booked as intangible assets about 50 percent of the $5.2 billion dollars spent on its Motorola Mobility smartphone and IBM Corp low-end server acquisitions.
Wong Waiming, Lenovo's chief financial officer, made the comments during a post-earnings conference call with media.
Lenovo posted a 19 percent jump in net income in the second fiscal quarter, but revenue fell short of analyst expectations, sending shares lower. (Reporting by Gerry Shih; Additional reporting by Paul Carsten)
