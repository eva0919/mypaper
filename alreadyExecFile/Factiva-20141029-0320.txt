(The Day Ahead is an email and PDF publication that includes the day's major stories and events, analyses and other features. To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) A fretful global economy and suddenly volatile markets will form the backdrop for the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. There is no press conference and no new individual economic forecasts due from policymakers. But the statement at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) Wednesday will be parsed for any sign that the Fed is worried that trouble in Europe or elsewhere may infect the U.S. recovery and slowg its timetable for an initial rate increase.

Pfizer Inc is expected to post lower third-quarter earnings, hurt by cheaper generics, but investors will be especially interested in clues on whether the largest U.S. drugmaker will renew its unsolicited bid for British rival AstraZeneca Plc. Pfizer walked away after its final $118 billion bid was rejected on May 26, but under UK law will be allowed to resume its quest for its smaller rival in late November.

DuPont, the largest U.S. chemical maker by market capitalization, is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit, helped by higher earnings from its safety and protection, nutrition and health and industrial biosciences businesses. However, the company's farm business is expected to take a hit from farmers' preference for soybean seeds rather than corn seeds, which is the mainstay of the unit. The focus this quarter will be also be on the company's response to demands from activist investor Nelson Peltz, who has called on the company to break itself up, blaming its conglomerate structure for "underperformance." U.S. durable goods orders probably rose in September, and a reading on business investment spending is also expected to show an increase. A good set of data would suggest the manufacturing recovery remains on solid ground after a see-saw ride in news orders that reflected lumpy aircraft demand (0830/1230). CaseShiller's home price index for August (0900/1300) and the Conference Board's consumer confidence figures for October will also be released (1000/1400). Consumer confidence is expected to edge higher after hitting its lowest level since May in September. Facebook Inc, owner of the world's No.1 Internet social network, releases third-quarter results after the bell. Mark Zuckerberg has wowed Wall Street by turning Facebook into the industry's most effective mobile advertising platform. But while investors should cheer what's expected to be another quarter of strong revenue growth, they will also be eager for details about the timeline for making money from the collection of pricy assets that the company has acquired, including Instagram, WhatsApp and virtual reality headset maker Oculus. Swiss bank UBS AG's third-quarter report comes as it faces down several potentially costly probes. Last month, UBS warned of new fines after confirming it was holding talks to settle allegations that it was involved in rigging foreign exchange rates. UBS also faces a French investigation into whether it helped wealthy French individuals dodge tax, in connection to which French investigating magistrates have proposed the bank pay a fine of 4.88 billion euros ($6.2 billion), according to a judicial source. UBS is currently asking investors to swap their shares into a new group holding company, a restructuring effort designed to ensure it can be broken up more easily in a crisis. Analysts expect French drugmaker Sanofi SA's third quarter to look good compared with year earlier, helped by a recovery in its animal health and vaccines units and by more favorable exchange rates. Investors will be on the lookout for comments on M&A, new allegations of bribery within Sanofi subsidiaries in East Africa and the Middle East, and the group's plans to offload a portfolio of off-patent drugs and the plants that make them in France. Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG is expected to report a slight rise in third-quarter sales, despite facing full generic competition to its once best-selling blood pressure pill Diovan for the first time.

Biotech Gilead Sciences Inc, maker of $84,000 hepatitis C drug Solvaldi, reports third-quarter results and will likely provide an update on the launch of Harvoni, an even more expensive combination treatment for the virus that was approved by regulators earlier this month. Early U.S. prescription statistics show that Harvoni is off to a strong start and investors will be looking for confirmation of continued robust sales despite the backlash from some insurers. Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company, is expected to provide an update on its pipleline of drugs in development and further details on the reorganization plans it announced in July at a formal presentation for analysts and investors at a New York hotel. Amgen may also address recent calls by a major shareholder to split into two companies - one for older legacy products and another for new growth medicines. Electronic Arts Inc offers the first snapshot of the videogaming industry when it reports third-quarter results after the bell as it gears up for the holiday season. The company that gave us the "Sims" and a hodge-podge of bestselling U.S. sporting simulations hopes to boost its software sales and devise a mobile-gaming strategy that can win Wall Street's approval. Arizona-based Freeport-McMoran Inc is expected to report lower earnings in the third quarter on the back of weaker copper and gold prices and volumes, the latter due to an export ban in Indonesia. The market's focus will likely be on the company's potential to build a smelter in Indonesia as well as the renegotiation of its contract of work in the country. There will likely also be questions on safety at the country's massive Grasberg mine after four workers died last month. Investors will also be hoping for an update on plans for sales of non-core assets as they company works to reduce its $20 billion debt. Anadarko Petroleum Corp reports third-quarter earnings, but Wall Street is most interested in the company's spending plans for next year following a more than 20 percent slide in crude prices. Health insurer Aetna Inc is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit and detail how its sizeable new business on the Obamacare exchanges is shaping up after its first full quarter of paying claims for these new customers. Hard-drive maker Western Digital Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit above analysts' estimates, according to StarMine, helped by higher demand for storage used in servers and data centers. Investors will look out for updates on the company's full-year outlook. Quarterly results from Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc, operator of the Sheraton and Westin hotel chains, and Marriott International Inc, owner of Ritz-Carlton brand, are expected to benefit from a strong increase in global travel. The market will be looking for an update on 2015 forecasts, when hotel occupancy in the U.S. is expected to be at the highest since 1995, according to a lodging forecast from PwC. For both companies, there will likely questions about how Ebola could affect travel. Timken Co is expected to report lower-than-expected third-quarter profit, hurt by weakness in the mining and agricultural industries, according to StarMine. Timken supplies ball bearings to companies such as Caterpillar and Cummins. Both the companies have cited softness in the mining industry for its weak results. Timken recently laid out plans to restructure its aerospace unit, which will result in pre-tax charges of $110 to $120 million in this quarter. Investors will be looking for comments on its reported bid for Emerson Electric's power transmission solutions business. Coal and natgas producer Consol Energy Inc is expected to post a third-quarter profit compared a year-earlier loss due to heavy tax expenses. However, revenue is expected to plunge about 28 percent amid weak natural gas and oil prices, and softening demand for thermal coal from the power sector. Investors will want to know about the future of demand, and the company's capital budget. Miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a bigger loss in the third quarter as weak prices for steel-making coal continues to offset cost cuts. Rail line congestion in Western U.S. states and a slowdown in the Chinese steel market is also expected to hurt the company's bottom line. Coach Inc, known for its Poppy handbags, will report first-quarter results amid high expectations as the company begins to see strong demand for its products from international markets. Investors will look for details on the company's performance in China, where it has seen strong growth in the past, and will also keep an eye out for any updates on the previously announced closure of about 70 stores in North America. Investors in speciality glass maker Corning Inc will focus on any benefit from strong sales of Apple Inc's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which use Corning's Gorilla glass and will also look for guidance on opportunities from the auto industry, which analysts say is larger than the LCD market and one that Corning is planning to enter. Discount brokerage firm TD Ameritrade Holding Corp reports its fiscal year-end results and outlook for 2015. Recent market volatility is a positive for the firm since it is popular with do-it-yourself traders who try to take advantages of ups and downs in the stock market. But the protracted delay by the Federal Reserve is a negative since AMTD and other discount brokers make much of their money on returns from investing their clients' cash. Insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc's third-quarter results are expected to beat estimates, according to StarMine. Marsh, which kicks off brokers' earnings season, is expected to benefit from the rising insurance rates in the United States. Satellite radio service provider Sirius XM Holdings Inc is expected to report third-quarter revenue above analysts' average estimate, according to StarMine. Analysts speculate the company is likely to benefit from a strong market for auto sales. Buyers of new cars fitted with Sirius receivers typically get free access for a few months but then must pay to keep the service. The company raised its full-year revenue forecast last quarter. Wall Street will be looking for an update from Panera Bread Co on its effort to speed up service at its popular bakery-cafes when it reports third-quarter results. Up until it started reporting problems with service times, Panera was mentioned in the same breath as Chipotle, which is renowned for its ability to squeeze ever more sales out of existing restaurants. Home appliance maker Whirlpool Corp and Cummins Inc, which makes diesel engines, gas turbines and assorted automotive parts, also report third-quarter results.

EXCLUSIVE-Amazon buys comedy service Rooftop Media to expand digital content

(Adds executives' comments, details on Rooftop and Audible)

By Liana B. Baker

NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is buying online comedy service Rooftop Media, a small deal that underscores the Internet retailer's broader ambition of becoming a media and entertainment powerhouse.

Amazon is persisting in buying content to round out its service, with designs to take on Netflix Inc and other online digital media services. But that increasing spending has helped keep the company in the red, inviting criticism from investors.

Audible, the audiobooks service it bought in 2008 for $300 million, is picking up the 10-person company for an undisclosed sum. Audible founder and Chief Executive Donald Katz said in a statement on Monday the company had been attracted by Rooftop's content as well as its pool of comic talent.

Rooftop records comedians at clubs across the country and licenses the digital rights to thousands of hours of comedy, which is broadcast either live or later on demand. The company's media partners include Apple Inc and Yahoo, and it also works with streaming services such as Sirius XM , Spotify and Pandora.

Its content now becomes part of Audible, itself a fast-growing seller of online audiobooks, and vastly increases Rooftop's audience, said Rooftop Chief Executive Officer Will Rogers.

Amazon is expected to continue acquiring digital content at a rapid clip. In past years, it began investing heavily to branch out from its online retail roots, delving into Hollywood-style content production as well as developing a line of tablets, smartphones and set-top boxes to accelerate the sale of digital content.

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos' vision of becoming a tech and media powerhouse, however, has drawn protests from an investor community that for years overlooked its lack of profits because of red-hot revenue growth.

That growth may be in danger of stalling. Last week, the company missed revenue and income expectations and projected a disappointing 7 to 18 percent rise in holiday-quarter sales.

CHICAGO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp will ban Apple Inc's new electronic payments service in its 4,572 stores as it commits to joining a consortium of other large retailers developing a rival payments system.

Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp , Kohl's Corp have all refused to accept Apple Pay at their stores.

Apple Pay, which was unveiled in September, is a mobile payment app that allows consumers to buy things by simply holding their iPhone6 and 6 Plus devices up to readers installed by store merchants.

The rival system, called Current C, is being developed by Merchants Customer Exchange (MCX), a consortium of merchants that includes Rite Aid and CVS.

Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said the company is continually evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies.

On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Rite Aid and CVS Health Corp had refused to accept Apple Pay.(http://nyti.ms/1rJ2RsA) CVS did not immediately respond to queries seeking comment.

"I think these two retailers - Rite Aid and CVS - have committed contractually to MCX," said Nick Holland, senior analyst, payments, Javelin Strategy & Research.

"I believe there was an exclusivity agreement ...which means that as part of the MCX consortium that was your point-of-sale mobile payment network." (Reporting by Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne in Chicago; Editing by David Gregorio)

* Axel Springer and New York Times invest 3 mln euros

* Readers charged average of 20 euro cents per story

* Blendle working on smartphone and tablet app

By Harro Ten Wolde

FRANKFURT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Publishers Axel Springer and The New York Times have together invested 3 million euros ($3.8 million) in Dutch start-up Blendle, betting it has answers to the problem of how to charge readers who eschew costly online subscriptions.

Publishers have been experimenting with how to charge for content since the early days of the Internet, but many have failed to crack the code.

With Blendle, readers can browse online newspaper and magazines and pay an average of 20 euro cents per story without being locked in to a subscription. Blendle keeps 30 percent of the fee, the publisher receives the rest.

The business also offers the attention-grabbing feature of potential refunds if a user does not like a story after reading it, though these have an upper limit depending on how many stories a reader has paid for.

The service is available only in the Netherlands as a web app, though Blendle is working on a smartphone and tablet app for Apple devices.

"The main reason we decided to go along with The New York Times and Axel Springer is that we think along the same lines about digital journalism," Blendle co-founder Alexander Kloepping said.

"We hope to use the knowledge and experience Springer and the New York Times can offer to build out the company. It may well be that our company looks completely different in a year."

Many newspaper and magazine publishers have been under pressure to replace an evaporating pool of print advertising income - once the lifeblood of newspapers - with digital advertisements and money from subscriptions.

Axel Springer now generates more than half of its revenue from digital activities, while circulation revenue at the New York Times has been been boosted by digital subscriptions that now account for more than 50 percent of total revenue.

'FREEMIUM' MODEL

German publisher Axel Springer has attracted more than 300,000 subscribers for its so-called "freemium" model for its best-selling daily newspaper Bild since launching the service more than a year ago.

Europe's largest daily offers some online content free but some items such as exclusive interviews, stories and photos are subject to a charge.

The New York Times had about 831,000 digital-only subscribers at the end of the second quarter, almost a fifth more than a year earlier, despite conceding that new digital products have failed to live up to expectations.

Blendle describes itself as "the iTunes of journalism", referring to Apple's music-selling service, and receives about half of its traffic via mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The other half is from desktop computers and about a fifth of revenue comes from social media referrals by other readers, Kloepping said.

"It is always good to try different models, but it will be difficult," said Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum. "Especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries. There will always be a lot of free news and articles available."

In the six months since it went live, Blendle has attracted more than 130,000 users in the Netherlands, 60 percent of whom are aged between 20 and 35.

That group is important for publishers because they increasingly consume information via tablets and smartphones instead of printed newspapers and magazines.

"We as a publisher want to convince people that in the digital age good journalism is worth the money," Axel Springer Chief Executive Mathias Doepfner said in a statement.

"Blendle has the potential to appeal to young, internet-savvy readers." (1 US dollar = 0.7873 euro) (Editing by David Goodman)

Corporate News: Fewer Tied to AT&T Plans

By Thomas Gryta

A surprising fact emerged from AT&T Inc.'s financial results this week: up to 10 million of the company's most lucrative wireless customers may be free to walk out the door.

The situation is a result of AT&T's transition from plans that offer subsidized phones under two-year contracts to plans where customers buy their own phones on 20- to 24-month installment plans without other obligations to stick with AT&T.

The contracts and installment plans both have the effect of binding customers to the carrier. But while AT&T is experiencing its lowest-ever rate of cancellations, the company indicated this week that millions of subscribers may have fallen through the cracks.

On Wednesday, AT&T surprised analysts when it said 20 million of its 75 million postpaid subscribers were getting discounted pricing and were eligible to upgrade to new phones on installment plans but hadn't signed up by Sept. 30. On Thursday, an AT&T spokesman said most of those 20 million subscribers were still on traditional contracts -- but not all, leaving potentially millions who are paying for service but have no obligation to stay with the carrier.

AT&T is confident those customers will stay put, however. Many are on plans with family members who may be under contract, and all are enjoying lower bills after AT&T cut their rates earlier this year, with a typical subscriber saving around $15 a month.

Still, their freedom to leave is a sign of the new competitive risks to wireless carriers as the industry moves rapidly away from the contract model.

"The real question is what will happen in Q4 when a large number of customers buy iPhones," said Craig Moffett, an analyst at researcher MoffettNathanson LLC. A large portion of AT&T smartphone customers use the iPhone, which was once exclusively sold by the carrier, and the recent update to the phone is expected to drive upgrades.

"At least some will look for better deals elsewhere. Churn will rise," Mr. Moffett said.

Carriers have moved away from contracts in part because customers don't like them and because the shift rids them of the burden of subsidizing expensive devices like Apple Inc.'s iPhone.

The rub for providers is that customers who pay for their own devices have an incentive to hang on to them as long as possible to hold down their expenses. This can leave them untethered to the carrier and vulnerable to competitors stealing them away.

An AT&T subscriber using two gigabytes of data a month on the carrier's no-contract Next plan and a fully paid-off phone would spend $65 a month for wireless service. Buying a new base model iPhone 6 would add at least $27 a month to the tally.

In February, AT&T quietly started cutting prices for customers on plans that require contracts. It has also made those people eligible to switch to a Next plan and upgrade to a new phone under its installment scheme after just six months under their existing contracts. Some people are still switching.

Millions of those eligible customers haven't taken the bait, and their numbers are swelling. On its earnings conference call Wednesday, AT&T said the number of subscribers who could upgrade but hadn't yet -- subscribers it calls "pre-Next" -- had grown from 17 million at the end of June.

Many of those customers are free to jump ship whenever they want. Some are in contracts that every month come closer to ending, while the rest have no financial obligation at all to stay with AT&T.

For carriers, having a large part of the customer base floating without obligations may be the new reality.

T-Mobile US Inc., which pioneered the no-contract model, has about 80% of its postpaid customers on such plans, and as many as a quarter of them aren't financing a device, meaning they aren't tethered to its service. Verizon Communications Inc. and Sprint Corp. don't disclose the portion of their customers not on contracts.

Installment plans have a similar effect to contracts as subscribers need to pay off the full cost of phones -- which can run to $650 or more -- if they leave the carrier.

Wall Street analysts raised concerns this week that the new disclosures signal AT&T may have to work harder to hold on to customers who may be staying around only because of discounts and are at risk of leaving when they do decide to upgrade their phones.

"The vast majority are on family plans," Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said in an interview. "They are locked in."

Mr. Stephens cited low monthly service cancellations, or churn, as proof that customers won't leave. AT&T's churn so far this year is on pace to be the company's lowest ever, including just 0.86% in the second quarter and 0.99% in the third quarter.

"The facts support that we are doing OK with keeping customers happy," Mr. Stephens said.

A Sad Song for iTunes Sales --- Apple Readies Relaunch of Beats Music as Downloads Drop 14% at Online Store

The growing availability of cheap music -- from free videos and streams to $10-a-month unlimited subscription plans -- is sapping demand for digital downloads at the world's biggest seller of music, Apple Inc.

Music sales at Apple's iTunes Store have fallen 13% to 14% world-wide since the start of the year, according to people familiar with the matter. The decline is stark compared with a much shallower dip last year. Global revenue from downloads fell 2.1% in 2013, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.

The plummeting download numbers help illustrate why Apple bought the $10-a-month subscription streaming service Beats Music earlier this year, as part of its $3 billion acquisition that included headphone maker Beats Electronics. Apple is rebuilding Beats Music and plans to relaunch it next year as part of iTunes, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Some record company executives worry their industry could lurch back into decline after several years of relative stability, should download sales decline faster than streaming growth accelerates. A key part of that equation, executives say, is persuading enough users of online music services to pay a monthly subscription fee, usually $10 a month, rather than stick with free versions that carry advertising and generate much less revenue for record labels. Spotify AB offers such a free, ad-supported option; Beats Music doesn't.

Factoring in CD sales, which have been plunging for well over a decade, overall music sales in most of the world held steady last year. Japan was an exception, with steep drops in physical and digital sales alike. World-wide revenue from recorded music totaled $15 billion in 2013. In the U.S., recorded music sales are nearly 50% below their peak in 2000, though they've been essentially flat for the past few years.

This year's decline in global iTunes music sales mirrors domestic declines. U.S. revenue from downloads of singles and albums fell 11% and 14%, respectively, in the first half of 2014, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. But a 28% jump in revenue from streaming music services helped overall digital revenue increase slightly to $2.2 billion in the first six months of the year.

Nielsen Entertainment analyst Dave Bakula chalked up the declines in downloads mostly to "a shift in the way consumers are consuming music," noting that total streams on services such as Spotify and Pandora Media Inc. were up 46% for the year to date, compared with last year. Streaming services now account for nearly one-third of the revenue from recorded music in the U.S., according to the RIAA.

On Thursday, Pandora, which offers both a paid streaming service and free, ad-supported music, said it ended the third quarter with 76.5 million active listeners, up 5.2% from a year earlier. Pandora's shares, however, tumbled Friday as it warned of "an increasingly competitive environment" and slowing user growth.

This week, Spotify dropped prices for its streaming service, allowing family members to share one account at discounted rates. The company, whose premium service typically costs $10 a month, has about 40 million subscribers, of whom around a quarter are paying users.

The relative trajectories of downloads and streaming vary widely from market to market. In Japan, the second biggest music market, there is little streaming business to speak of. In a handful of smaller markets including Sweden, streaming is almost all there is; paid downloads are virtually unheard of.

Despite the slowing U.S. music sales, Apple reported this week that global iTunes sales -- including movies, apps and books -- increased to $4.6 billion in the third quarter, up from $4.3 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Apple didn't break out figures for music sales.

Another factor potentially weighing down digital sales could be this year's album release schedule, which features bigger end-of-the-year releases than last year's, said Nielsen's Mr. Bakula. Taylor Swift's forthcoming pop album, "1989," is slated for release next week and is expected to be one of the year's biggest sellers. British boy band One Direction and hip-hop star Eminem have albums due out next month.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- The New Basics: Stocks: How to Play Defense

By John F. Wasik   
1,012 words

The stock market has been taking investors on a white-knuckle ride in recent weeks. Some of the ways investors try to manage volatility can be nerve-racking, too.

The S&P 500 has fallen more than 1% six times and risen more than 1% five times since the index hit an all-time high on Sept. 18. By contrast, there weren't any such single-day swings between Aug. 9 and Sept. 24.

Jittery investors are worried about the U.S. economic recovery, higher interest rates and slow growth in Europe, among other issues. Strong gains in recent years have boosted share prices and stoked concerns that stocks are priced too high.

The market upheaval has put a spotlight on strategies investors can use to try to protect themselves from steep losses in a downturn. For example, a handful of funds allow investors to profit from volatile moves and log gains when stocks fall.

But the share prices of such funds can just as quickly leap or fall. "You don't just plunk them in a portfolio for the long term," says Eric Dutram, an analyst who tracks exchange-traded funds at Zacks Investments, a research firm based in Chicago.

For investors who just want to smooth out a bumpy ride, the better bet may be a balanced fund that holds a mix of stocks and bonds. Here's what you need to know about each approach.

-- The wagers of fear. Financial whizzes look for signs of volatility in stock prices by watching the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index, or VIX, informally known as the fear gauge.

The VIX tracks near-term volatility as measured by S&P 500 index options prices. A high VIX means stock prices are more likely to fluctuate -- and often decline. As recently as July, the VIX was at its lowest level since 2007, before the financial crisis.

But the index has spiked recently, which has benefited investors in funds that track the VIX. The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Exchange-Traded Note, which has $968 million invested, gained 15% over the past month, through Thursday, according to Chicago-based investment researcher Morningstar. Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments backed by the issuer that promise to pay a return based on the performance of a market measure.

A similar fund, the ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, which has $90 million invested, is up 14% over the same period.

The iPath note charges annual fees of 0.89%, or $89 on a $10,000 investment, while the ProShares fund charges 0.83%.

But such products also can lose big in periods of calm, such as when stocks are gaining steadily or basically flat, which makes them unsuitable for most buy-and-hold investors. The iPath note, for example, fell nearly 78% in 2012 and 67% last year. Even with its recent gains, the note is down 21% year to date, according to Morningstar.

The risks are real even for investors who watch their portfolios carefully, because it is difficult if not impossible to consistently predict when stocks will be calm or volatile.

-- Down is the new up. Some funds aim to profit when stocks drop. As with funds that benefit from volatility, however, the secret to success is the perilous art of timing your bets.

The ProShares Short S&P 500 ETF, for example, offers investors the inverse of the daily return of the S&P 500, including dividends. If the index loses 1% in a day, the fund should gain about 1%, and the profits and losses can diverge to some extent and compound over time for investors who hold the fund for longer periods.

For example, the ProShares fund is up 1.3% over the past month, through Thursday, while the S&P 500 has fallen 1.5% over that period. But the fund is down 8% year to date, compared with a 7.3% return for the S&P 500. The fund has $1.8 billion in assets and charges annual fees of 0.89%.

The ProShares fund can help insulate investors. In 2008, during the financial crisis, the fund rose 39%. But it has dropped every year since, including a nearly 26% decline last year, as stocks recovered.

A similar ETF, the ProShares Short Dow30, places a narrower bet on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has lagged behind the S&P 500 this year.

-- Striking a balance. Investors who have no special insight into what the stock market will do nonetheless have ways to cushion their portfolios.

One of the simplest options is a balanced fund that holds chunks of both stocks and bonds in hopes that the stocks will provide growth and the bonds some measure of insurance because their prices often rise when stocks fall.

The Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, for example, had 56% of its assets in stocks such as Apple and Exxon Mobil, as of Sept. 30, and the rest in U.S. Treasurys and other bonds as well as some cash. The fund is down 0.3% over the past month, through Thursday, but up 5.9% year to date.

A similar fund, the Fidelity Balanced Fund, had 72% of its assets in stocks and the rest in bonds, cash and other investments as of Sept. 30. The fund is down 1% over the past month, but up 6.3% this year.

These types of funds have attracted wide interest. The Vanguard fund has $23.2 billion in assets and the Fidelity fund has $26.6 billion. The annual fee on Admiral shares of the Vanguard fund is 0.09%, and the fee is 0.58% for the Fidelity fund.

The returns on a balanced fund may not be anything to brag about. But if wild rides are what bother you, it may be a calmer place to park your money.

Heard on the Street
Pandora Hits A Discordant Growth Note

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Competition may be catching up to Pandora Media. And that isn't its biggest hurdle.

The Internet music service's third-quarter results slightly beat estimates. It also raised guidance. But user-growth issues and worries about rising content costs drowned out those positive notes.

Pandora only added a net 100,000 active users over the previous quarter. That compares with sequential step-ups of 1.6 million and 3.8 million in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Pandora has added only a net 300,000 users in 2014's first nine months.

The company said "an increasingly competitive environment" would make driving monthly user growth more difficult. Yet analysts forecast net user additions of around nine million in 2015. That will require higher marketing expenses and may not be enough amid competition from the likes of Apple's iTunes Radio.

Pandora maintains it can eventually reach 100 million monthly active users, up from 76.5 million at the end of the third quarter, with help from trends like more car installations. It said listening hours, which rose 25% year over year in the quarter, are a more important measure of engagement. But there is a limit to how much those can rise without user growth.

And content costs, about 50% of revenue, are a big unknown. The government board that dictates royalties paid by Internet radio providers won't conclude its rate-setting process until December 2015. Pandora wants a sizable decrease in its per-song rate, while SoundExchange, representing artists, wants a big increase. Meeting in the middle would mean a 35% rise in 2016 content costs, says SIG Susquehanna Financial Group.

Even if Pandora's rates do end up falling, that much uncertainty tends to hurt investors' ears.

REVIEW --- Moving Targets: Dear Corporations, Don't Forget to Write

I'm always getting calls -- some live, some recorded -- from companies or mutual funds asking for my vote on board proposals. The people who call, live or recorded, are always very nice and genuinely interested in my opinions. The message they transmit is: We are not some cold, impersonal behemoth sitting in cyberspace. We are flesh and blood. And we care.

Why, then, did Bill Gross jump ship at Pimco without letting me know? I've got about one-tenth of my 401(k) socked away in that Total Return Fund of his, but last month the guy just bailed on me. No heads-up, no bittersweet adieu; he just up and left. Nor did Pimco itself see fit to send me an explanatory note, or even a little conciliatory message assuring me that things were going to be all right. Even though other shareholders were cashing out left and right.

"We were going to fire the bum anyway," the note might have read. "The dude was getting way too flaky."

When a company wants to change one of its bylaws or policies, it often calls me up or sends me a nicely worded letter, asking if I support the board's resolution. But when the guy who got Pimco off the ground in the first place, with help from little guys like me -- when this big shot abruptly decided to take a hike -- I got nothing but silence.

Not to get all touchy-feely about this, but I think of Pimco as a friend. I really do. I like those guys out in Newport Beach, Calif. They've been good to me. They're my bros. But now I feel like they've just totally dissed me. And Pimco isn't the only company that has recently given me the high hat.

Last month, when Apple decided to force-feed iTunes users the new U2 album, nobody bothered to tell me. As a shareholder in this legendarily arrogant corporation, I was left red-faced and sputtering, having to defend the company's insolent behavior to friends who hate the company and really hate U2 and know that I own Apple. For the record, I hate U2 too. Something about Bono's shades. And that weird hair color of his. His 'do looks worse than Springsteen's.

It's the little things that count in life, and I don't think some companies understand this. When I've got a nice chunk of change invested in Microsoft, I would like a little bit of advance notice that they are going to ditch the friendly Windows interface and replace it with something ghastly. Or that they are going to spend a couple billion dollars on a videogame company I never heard of.

If Disney is going to bankroll some stupid Hercules film starring the Rock just a few months after somebody else released a stupid Hercules film, I think the least they could do is drop me and all the other faithful shareholders a line in advance. If Merck or Pfizer is going to sideline a controversial drug, could someone give me a heads-up? For old time's sake?

And if one of the energy companies I own stock in is planning to frack its way right across the Keystone State, could somebody give me a holler, so I can remember not to tell any of my relatives in Harrisburg that I own stock in the company? Finally, could Nokia or Motorola occasionally send me a little note saying: "Disregard what you may have heard, Joe. We still exist."

I really, really like the companies I invest in. They've been like friends to me. But investing is a two-way street, and I expect a little love in return. If I had poured a hundred grand into one of my friends' businesses, he wouldn't change jobs without letting me know he was leaving. And if one of my friends threatened to download U2's new album onto my computer or my iPod, he wouldn't do it without asking first. That way, I could say, "Could you download the new Tony Bennett/Lady Gaga album instead? I hate Bono's hair."

Corrections & Amplifications

Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook told a Chinese media outlet that the company's four Beijing retail stores serve about 250,000 customers a week. A Business & Finance article in the Friday-Sunday edition about Apple's plans in China incorrectly stated that Mr. Cook said it serves 750,000 customers a day in 15 Apple-branded stores across China.

(WSJA Oct. 27, 2014)

(END)

BEIJING -- Apple Inc. plans to increase the number of its Apple-brand retail stores in Greater China to 40 from 15 within two years, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday.

In an interview with Chinese news portal Sina.com, Mr. Cook said the Cupertino, Calif., company will also increase investment in China by an unspecified amount. "In the future, China will become Apple's biggest revenue contributor," he said, according to Sina.com. "It's just a matter of time."

An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the remarks. Greater China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.

China is Apple's third-largest market after the U.S. and Europe and is an important growth driver for the company. Its revenue growth in Greater China, however, slowed sharply in the latest quarter ahead of the release of its new iPhone, which was delayed by regulators in China until this month.

Mr. Cook's trip is being portrayed by some Chinese media outlets as part of the company's attempt to assuage concerns the Chinese government or public might have about the security of data stored on its phones. In July, state broadcaster China Central Television called a location-tracking function on the iPhone a "national security concern." Apple has said it doesn't keep user data.

The official Xinhua News Agency said Mr. Cook and China's Vice Premier Ma Kai "exchanged views on protection of users' information" when they met on Wednesday.

Apple faces competition in China from South Korean company Samsung Electronics Co. as well as Chinese manufacturers. Apple ranked No. 6 in China's smartphone market in the second quarter, according to research firm IDC.

Mr. Cook said Apple has 7,000 employees in China serving 750,000 customers daily in 15 Apple-branded stores. "You could say they're the world's busiest retail stores," he said.

Stocks: How to Play Defense; Specialized Funds Designed to Hedge Risk May Not Be the Best Choice

The stock market has been taking investors on a white-knuckle ride in recent weeks. Some of the ways investors try to manage volatility can be nerve-racking, too.

The S&P 500 has fallen more than 1% six times and risen more than 1% five times since the index hit an all-time high on Sept. 18. By contrast, there weren¡¦t any such single-day swings between Aug. 9 and Sept. 24.

Jittery investors are worried about the U.S. economic recovery, higher interest rates and slow growth in Europe, among other issues. Strong gains in recent years have boosted share prices and stoked concerns that stocks are priced too high.

The market upheaval has put a spotlight on strategies investors can use to try to protect themselves from steep losses in a downturn. For example, a handful of funds allow investors to profit from volatile moves and log gains when stocks fall.

But the share prices of such funds can just as quickly leap or fall. ¡§You don¡¦t just plunk them in a portfolio for the long term,¡¨ says Eric Dutram, an analyst who tracks exchange-traded funds at Zacks Investments, a research firm based in Chicago.

For investors who just want to smooth out a bumpy ride, the better bet may be a balanced fund that holds a mix of stocks and bonds. Here¡¦s what you need to know about each approach.

The wagers of fear. Financial whizzes look for signs of volatility in stock prices by watching the Chicago Board Options Exchange¡¦s Volatility Index, or VIX, informally known as the fear gauge.

The VIX tracks near-term volatility as measured by S&P 500 index options prices. A high VIX means stock prices are more likely to fluctuate¡Xand often decline. As recently as July, the VIX was at its lowest level since 2007, before the financial crisis.

But the index has spiked recently, which has benefited investors in funds that track the VIX. The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Exchange-Traded Note, which has $968 million invested, gained 15% over the past month, through Thursday, according to Chicago-based investment researcher Morningstar. Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments backed by the issuer that promise to pay a return based on the performance of a market measure.

A similar fund, the ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, which has $90 million invested, is up 14% over the same period.

The iPath note charges annual fees of 0.89%, or $89 on a $10,000 investment, while the ProShares fund charges 0.83%.

But such products also can lose big in periods of calm, such as when stocks are gaining steadily or basically flat, which makes them unsuitable for most buy-and-hold investors. The iPath note, for example, fell nearly 78% in 2012 and 67% last year. Even with its recent gains, the note is down 21% year to date, according to Morningstar.

The risks are real even for investors who watch their portfolios carefully, because it is difficult if not impossible to consistently predict when stocks will be calm or volatile.

Down is the new up. Some funds aim to profit when stocks drop. As with funds that benefit from volatility, however, the secret to success is the perilous art of timing your bets.

The ProShares Short S&P500 ETF, for example, offers investors the inverse of the daily return of the S&P 500, including dividends, minus fees. If the index loses 1% in a day, the fund should gain about 1%, and the profits and losses can diverge to some extent and compound over time for investors who hold the fund for longer periods.

For example, the ProShares fund is up 1.3% over the past month, through Thursday, while the S&P 500 has fallen 1.5% over the same period. But the fund is down 8.0% year to date, compared with a 7.3% return for the S&P 500. The fund has $1.8 billion in assets and charges annual fees of 0.89%.

The ProShares fund can help insulate investors. In 2008, during the financial crisis, the fund rose 39%. But it has dropped every year since, including a nearly 26% decline last year, as stocks recovered.

A similar ETF, the ProShares Short Dow30, places a narrower bet on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has lagged behind the S&P 500 this year.

Striking a balance. Investors who have no special insight into what the stock market will do nonetheless have ways to cushion their portfolios.

One of the simplest options is a balanced fund that holds chunks of both stocks and bonds in hopes that the stocks will provide growth and the bonds some measure of insurance because their prices often rise when stocks fall.

The Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, for example, had 56% of its assets in stocks such as Apple and Exxon Mobil, as of Sept. 30, and the rest in U.S. Treasurys and other bonds as well as some cash. The fund is down 0.3% over the past month, through Thursday, but up 5.9% year to date.

A similar fund, the Fidelity Balanced Fund, had 72% of its assets in stocks and the rest in bonds, cash and other investments as of Sept. 30. The fund is down 1% over the past month, but up 6.3% this year.

These types of funds have attracted wide interest. The Vanguard fund has $23.2 billion in assets and the Fidelity fund has $26.6 billion. The annual fee on Admiral shares of the Vanguard fund is 0.09%, and the fee is 0.58% for the Fidelity fund.

The returns on a balanced fund may not be anything to brag about. But if wild rides are what bother you, it may be a calmer place to park your money.

Oct 24 (Reuters) - U.S. TV startup Roku Inc is working on plans to confidentially file for an initial public offering, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Roku has been working with investment banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Inc, to prepare for a potential offering that could raise as much as $150 million, the Journal said. (http://on.wsj.com/12suIaK)

The company, which makes set-top boxes that connect TVs to the Internet, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

The timing of any deal is not yet set, and it is also not yet clear what valuation Roku might seek, the financial daily reported.

Roku Working on Plans to File Confidentially for IPO; Potential Offering Could Raise as Much as $150 Million

Roku Inc., maker of streaming media players, TVs, and software, is working on plans to file confidentially for an initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company has been working with investment banks including Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Inc. on preparing for a potential offering that could raise as much as $150 million, the people said. The timing of any deal isn¡¦t yet set, and it also isn¡¦t yet clear what valuation Roku might seek, they added.

Roku, founded in 2002, became known to consumers through small boxes that hook up to TVs and stream video from services including Netflix Inc. and Hulu. Its business grew as some people ¡§cut the cord¡¨ and canceled their cable-TV service. Roku said in September that it had sold 10 million streaming video players in the U.S.

The market for streaming media players is still growing rapidly, expected to rise from 24 million units in the U.S. this year to 44 million by 2017, according to research firm IHS Inc. While Apple Inc.¡¦s Apple TV and Roku dominate that market, with a combined 94% share, new devices from Google Inc. and others could make it more competitive, IHS said.

More recently, Roku has expanded into other businesses, including Roku televisions produced with other manufacturers. It also partners with cable companies to provide software, and now aims to sells advertising space on its platform, according to recent company statements.

The Saratoga, Calif.-based company has so far raised more than $150 million in private capital from investors including some of the companies it partners with, such as Netflix and British Sky Broadcasting, Roku has said. It has also raised money from Hearst Corp., Fidelity Investments, Menlo Ventures and News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal.

In early October, CEO and founder Anthony Wood told publication the Information that Roku generated $190 million in revenue in 2013, and was ¡§getting closer¡¨ to profitability.

Companies are generally eligible to file confidentially for IPOs in the U.S. if they have less than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Mr. Wood is a former Netflix executive and founder of several media companies.

Though IPOs in the past few weeks have struggled amid a broader market correction, the market has been welcoming to new offerings from consumer technology firms recently. Camera maker GoPro Inc. is trading up around 200% since its June IPO, and Mobileye NV, which makes camera safety systems for cars, is up around 100% from its August debut.

Hon Hai says reviewing investments after media reports on $5.7 bln China plant

TAIPEI, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd said Friday it was reviewing its investment plans after media reports said the major Apple Inc supplier may invest up to $5.7 billion in a factory to make smartphone displays in China.

On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Hon Hai was in talks with the government of Zhengzhou, in Henan province, about investing as much as 35 billion yuan in a new factory that would make high-end screens for iPhones and other mobile devices.

Local media in Taiwan also carried similar reports on Friday.

In a stock market filing responding to the reports, Hon Hai said: "The company's investment plans after going through a necessary review process will be submitted to the board and will be handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."

Media officials for Hon Hai, which is also known by its trade name Foxconn, declined to comment further.

Hon Hai is the world's largest electronic contract manufacturer and assembles the majority of Apple's new iPhone 6 and the bigger-screen 6 Plus model.

Uncool Microsoft Grows Hot Again

By Shira Ovide

Microsoft Corp. may not be cool, but its sales continue to defy expectations by growing at a much faster clip than those of its business-technology peers.

Microsoft's revenue rose 11% from a year earlier in the three months ended Sept. 30, excluding Nokia's mobile-phone business that Microsoft purchased last spring.

Meanwhile, competitors in corporate technology -- such as International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Oracle Corp. -- posted shrinking or slow sales growth.

"Microsoft is bucking the trend," said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets.

Microsoft's stock rose 3.1% in after-hours trading Thursday following the release of its financial report for the fiscal first quarter. The company's stock price has reflected strong revenue and profit growth in the past year.

Shares climbed 33% in the past year through Thursday's market close, far outpacing the S&P 500 stock index over the period.

The company's market value recently surpassed that of Google Inc. for the first time since June 2013.

The latest quarterly results continue a charmed first year in office for Satya Nadella, who in February was named chief executive, only the third in Microsoft's history.

Mr. Nadella has focused on many of the same lines of business as his predecessors, and earlier investments in cloud computing and the Xbox videogame console have paid off under his watch.

Mr. Nadella has won over Wall Street with his willingness to cut jobs, favor innovation over existing businesses and de-emphasize products outside Microsoft's core offerings.

In the most recent quarter, Microsoft's revenue from software for business customers rose more than 9.5% from a year earlier.

The company had robust growth in both newer offerings such as Microsoft Office 365 (an online version of the popular desk-jockey software suite) and mature products like the version of Windows for computer servers.

Cloud software sold to businesses -- primarily Office 365, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM sales tool and the Azure cloud-computing service -- more than doubled to $1.18 billion, or roughly 5.1% of total revenue for the quarter.

But Microsoft executives said during a conference call that customers for Azure, which lets corporate IT departments and software developers rent computing horsepower and storage capacity by the hour, also buy the company's traditional corporate software.

Microsoft's mobile business remains a trouble spot. Sales of Windows-powered Nokia smartphones rose, but the company continues to lose market share to Apple Inc. and manufacturers of phones that run Google's Android operating software.

Microsoft made less money than it did a year earlier from its mobile-phone operating software business, largely because Android-phone makers such as Samsung Electronics Co. sold more of their inexpensive phones, which generate lower fees for Microsoft. Android phone makers pay Microsoft a royalty for Microsoft patents used in the Google operating system.

Sales of Windows operating software for personal computers also declined, but less than in prior quarters, driven by improving demand for PCs since their 2013 swoon.

The company made more headway with its other consumer hardware products.

Revenue more than doubled for the Surface tablet computer, which sold poorly when it launched two years ago. The Surface Pro 3, released in June, received a more positive reception, the company said. The newer device is positioned more as a laptop replacement than a tablet computer.

Microsoft also sold twice as many Xboxes as a year ago, it said, helped by a $100 price cut for the latest model.

Despite Microsoft's recent successes, Google tends to get the buzz once reserved for the Redmond, Wash., company.

In an interview, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood was unfazed. "I wasn't that cool in high school, either," she said.

Overall in the quarter, Microsoft revenue was $23.2 billion, including the Nokia business, compared with $18.5 billion a year ago. Net income fell to $4.5 billion, or 54 cents a share, from $5.2 billion, or 62 cents, in the same quarter last year.

Microsoft's profit was weighed down by about $1.1 billion, or 11 cents a share, in part due to costs related to a massive round of job cuts Mr. Nadella pushed through this summer.

UNILEVER

Consumer-Brands Firm

Posts Slow Sales

Unilever PLC on Thursday warned of a tough global outlook and struck a gloomy tone after reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth in five years, raising fears of a continued economic slowdown across emerging markets.

The maker of Magnum ice cream and Dove shampoo posted third-quarter underlying sales growth of 2.1%, down markedly from 3.2% in the same period a year earlier and marking the Anglo-Dutch consumer-product company's worst performance since the fourth quarter of 2009.

Underlying sales growth, which was 3.8% in the second quarter, is adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange-rate changes.

"It is really tough out there. We have been at pains to say that for a long period of time," said Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Huet, citing the impact of both price deflation and weak sales demand across key markets.

Revenue in the quarter fell 2% to 12.2 billion euros ($15.4 billion), hit by a 2.6% negative currency impact, compared with a market consensus forecast of around 14 billion euros. Profit figures weren't disclosed.

Brazilian firms Cutrale-Safra on Thursday raised their bid for Chiquita Brands International Inc. by an additional 4% as the banana company's shareholders prepare to vote Friday on its proposed tie-up with Irish food company Fyffes PLC.

Cutrale-Safra, a coalition of a Brazilian orange-juice maker and an investment firm, raised their offer for Chiquita to $14.50 a share, up from the increased offer of $14 a share it made last week. The new bid values the company at $742 million.

Chiquita responded by saying it would carefully review the offer.

Cutrale-Safra first entered the bidding for Chiquita in August with a bid valued at $666 million, or $13 a share. Chiquita's board has rejected both of Cutrale-Safra's previous bids as too low.

Cutrale-Safra's 11th-hour bid came as Chiquita continued to pursue its planned merger with Irish banana grower Fyffes, a tie-up that would create the world's largest banana seller.

HYUNDAI HEAVY INDUSTRIES

Union Backs Possible

Strike Next Month

Unionized workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries late Wednesday endorsed a possible strike over wage and benefit issues, threatening to halt production at the world's biggest shipbuilding company for the first time in 20 years.

About 18,000 union members, or two-thirds of the South Korean shipbuilder's total workforce, overwhelmingly voted to walk off the job as early as next month, said union spokesman Kim Hyung-gyun on Thursday.

"Despite the vote result, union leaders will try to seek a negotiated wage deal with the management this week. But if the company doesn't accept our demand, we have no other choice but to go on strike," he said.

A company spokesman said both sides would meet later Thursday and intense negations could start as early as Friday.

If workers strike, it will be the first affecting Hyundai Heavy since 1994 when a 63-day stoppage cost it 530 billion won ($522 million).

APPLE

More Stores to Arrive in

China Within Two Years

Apple Inc. plans to increase the number of its Apple-brand retail stores in Greater China to 40 from 15 within two years, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday.

In an interview with Chinese news portal Sina.com, Mr. Cook said the Cupertino, Calif., company will also increase investment in China by an unspecified amount. "In the future, China will become Apple's biggest revenue contributor," he said, according to Sina.com. "It's just a matter of time."

An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the remarks. Greater China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.

China is Apple's third-largest market after the U.S. and Europe and is an important growth driver for the company. Its revenue growth in Greater China, however, slowed sharply in the latest quarter ahead of the release of its new iPhone, which was delayed by regulators in China until this month.

Corporate News: Apple Ex-Retail Chief Leads Startup

Ron Johnson, who helped build Apple Inc.'s successful retail stores before a troubled stint as chief executive of J.C. Penney Co., is getting back in the game with a well-funded startup that aims to bring some of the Apple Store mystique to online shopping.

The new company is called Enjoy, and Mr. Johnson says its goal is to change the way people buy and use the "things that matter" in a world in which consumers start their shopping online. The service is scheduled to start in 2015.

In a move reminiscent of his old boss at Apple, Steve Jobs, Mr. Johnson is keeping most of Enjoy's plans and strategy secret to avoid tipping off rivals.

But he said Enjoy aims to help shoppers develop a connection with new products, in the way that Apple Stores let shoppers try its products. For example, Mr. Johnson said it is hard for customers to understand the capabilities of a new product like a GoPro camera from shopping online.

As Amazon.com Inc. and Google Inc. jostle to sell everyday items on the Web and deliver them as quickly as possible, Mr. Johnson says they overlook the human aspect of helping shoppers find the right products, especially for infrequently purchased items that are more complex and expensive.

"That's when you typically want something more than fast delivery; you might want a little help," Mr. Johnson said in an interview. "There's a place for high touch in a high-tech world."

He has sold some big-name investors on his vision. Enjoy has raised $30 million, including a recent $25 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Oak Investment Partners. Andreessen Horowitz is also an investor. Mr. Johnson declined to disclose Enjoy's valuation.

A one-time executive of Target Corp., Mr. Johnson was the architect of Apple's retail strategy, which aimed to establish a deeper connection with customers. The minimalist stores allowed people to touch and try Apple's computers. The stores also feature a Genius Bar that provides technical advice or help in setting up new products. The strategy worked: Apple Stores generate more sales per square foot than any other retailer, including luxury brands like Tiffany & Co.

Mr. Johnson left Apple in 2011 to become the CEO of J.C. Penney. But his efforts to overhaul stores and cut back on discounting led to a massive drop in sales. The company ousted Mr. Johnson in April 2013.

He said he took a "one-year sabbatical," spending time speaking to entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. During those conversations, he said, he realized that while customers start shopping online, e-commerce sites focus more on the speed and cost of delivery than on helping them buy the right products.

"Just because we're moving online, it doesn't mean that need for a connection is going away. No one has really thought that through yet," he said.

Last month, technology-news site The Information said Mr. Johnson was launching a high-end delivery service for gadgets and dispatching employees in energy-efficient branded vans. Without going into specifics, Mr. Johnson said: "We don't need another delivery service."

Mr. Johnson has recruited a team of well-known executives to Enjoy, including Jerry McDougal, a former retail vice president at Apple.

Post-Handset Nokia Forges On

STOCKHOLM -- Nokia Corp.'s quarterly earnings signaled that the company's main network unit has moved well beyond several years of painful restructuring.

The former handset giant gave a more bullish full-year outlook Thursday after swinging to a profit in the third quarter. Its earnings were boosted by a 13% rise in revenue, as the Finnish telecom-equipment supplier deployed high-speed mobile networks in North America and China.

Nokia's net profit in the quarter was 747 million euros ($945 million), compared with a 91 million euros loss a year earlier, helped also by a large tax gain. Revenue increased to 3.32 billion euros.

"Progress was widespread, with four of our six regions increasing sales," Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said.

Mr. Suri has led Nokia's mobile-network unit since 2009 and was appointed as Nokia's CEO in late April this year, as the company transferred its unprofitable phone business to Microsoft Corp. Without the handset business, Nokia is now a mobile-network firm competing with Huawei Technologies Co. and Ericsson. Nokia also has a Berlin-based digital-mapping operation and a large number of patents.

Nokia's mobile-network arm, which until recently was plagued with overcapacity and losses after a difficult merger with Siemens AG's mobile-network unit, has staged a comeback and is benefiting from deals with China Mobile Ltd. and Sprint Corp., which are ramping up their high-speed mobile Internet services.

Nokia said it expects a full-year operating-profit margin of slightly above 11%, having previously forecast a margin in the high single digits. It confirmed that it expects net sales for its main networks unit to grow on a year-to-year basis in the second half of 2014.

Nokia's stock rose sharply Thursday on the Helsinki stock exchange after the earnings release, finishing the day 3.5% higher at 6.74 euros.

The Finnish company booked a 2 billion euros tax benefit in the quarter, which was partly offset by a 1.2 billion euros goodwill impairment charge related to its HERE digital-mapping unit.

Unlike Google Inc. and Apple Inc.'s mapping services, Nokia's platform largely targets corporate customers, like auto makers and logistics-dependent businesses such as FedEx Corp., that pay licensing fees. Still, Nokia is about to release free-of-charge map apps for consumers using mobile devices running Google Inc.'s Android and Apple Inc.'s iOS platform.

Mr. Suri said he isn't in favor of running advertisements on Nokia's mapping service, as Google does, and that the business will remain geared toward enterprise customers and the automotive industry. He added that while its mapping operation might appear an odd fit next to Nokia's network business, the company is a suitable owner of the unit.

"Nokia is a good owner of HERE, we have a balance sheet that can help the operation," he said, adding that combining advanced high-speed network technology with a mapping asset can assist developers of autonomous cars, for instance.

In a separate announcement on Thursday, Nokia said it would appoint Sean Fernback as the new president of its HERE unit. Mr. Fernback, a former TomTom NV executive, joined HERE earlier this year and will succeed Michael Halbherr, who stepped down and left the unit in August.

Foxconn Aims to Make Screens for iPhones in China

By Lorraine Luk   
783 words
24 October 2014
The Wall Street Journal Europe

HONG KONG -- Foxconn Technology Co., the company that assembles the bulk of the world's iPhones, is in preliminary talks to build a factory in northern China that would make high-end screens for the phones as well, in a sign of the Taiwan-based company's ambition to move up the electronics food chain.

Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is discussing a possible investment with the government of Zhengzhou, according to people familiar with the talks. The two sides are discussing terms such as how to divide the investment, which could reach as much as 35 billion yuan ($5.7 billion), the people said. The company already has a factory in Zhengzhou -- about 750 kilometers south of Beijing -- that mainly assembles the latest iPhones and makes components such as metal casings.

The two sides haven't yet formulated a concrete investment proposal, they said. If an agreement is reached, it could be Foxconn's biggest direct investment to date in high-end parts manufacturing.

It remains unclear whether iPhone maker Apple Inc. or other investors are being approached to invest in the display plant.

Currently, Apple uses screens made by suppliers in South Korea and Japan.

The development highlights Foxconn's ambition to supply more expensive components to key customers like Apple. While Foxconn, with revenue of $130 billion last year, has been manufacturing some iPhone components already, like metal casings and cables, mobile displays are much more difficult to make and have higher margins.

That is important to Foxconn, whose sales rose only 1% last year, compared with 53% annual growth five years ago, while operating profit margin growth slowed to 2.8% in 2013 from 4.4% in 2009.

Foxconn also is looking for more sources of revenue since Apple, whose orders account for nearly half of its sales, is starting to outsource production of some of its iPhones and iPads to rivals including Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp.

With $19 billion in cash as of the end of June, Foxconn has the hefty amount of capital needed for an investment in advanced manufacturing facilities.

For Apple, buying displays from Foxconn would help the company diversify its screen suppliers beyond Japan's Sharp Corp. and Japan Display Inc. and South Korea's LG Display Co.

"Foxconn hopes to capture the growing demand for high-resolution, energy-efficient displays and supply Apple and other smartphone makers in the next few years," said a person familiar with the situation.

Apple declined to comment.

To be sure, Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou is known for making ambitious statements and floating investment ideas that sometimes don't materialize.

In 2012, Mr. Gou acquired a 50% stake in a Sharp Corp. display factory in Sakai, Japan, and at the same time Foxconn agreed to take a 10% stake in the Japanese company for 66.9 billion yen, or $819 million. Foxconn pulled out of the deal after Sharp's share price fell sharply. In January, speaking at the company's 40th anniversary gathering, Mr. Gou said Foxconn is studying the feasibility of building an advanced-panel manufacturing plant in the U.S., though no details have emerged since.

Foxconn also has floated the idea of building a manufacturing plant for components and handsets in Indonesia, and Mr. Gou said he would consider investing at least $1 billion during a February visit to Jakarta. Last month, Foxconn said it is still reviewing the potential investment, while Indonesian Finance Minister Chatib Basri told The Wall Street Journal that the plan is stalled over unrealistic demands from Foxconn, including free land and import protections.

"The chairman always has lots of new business and investment ideas and he is also approached by many government officials," said a Foxconn official. "Only a few of them materialize as the chairman wants favorable terms that most governments can't accommodate."

Foxconn has had more success in China, where it has more than 10 manufacturing sites that employ more than one million workers.

Thanks to strong demand for bigger-screen iPhones, Foxconn has been heavily recruiting workers in Zhengzhou, where it has been producing about a half million iPhones a day, people familiar with the matter said.

According to the people, Mr. Gou visited Zhengzhou in August, where he met government officials to discuss the investment proposal. Foxconn General Manager Wu Yi-Wei, who leads the display operation, also went to Zhengzhou with a team to survey the site last month, the person said.

Mr. Gou has said he wants Foxconn to be a major player in the display industry.

OFF DUTY --- Adventure & Travel -- Journal Concierge: Warsaw --- Explore behind the facade to find a 'lovely old gal' of a city

Warsaw has long been seen as the ugly stepsister of Krakow. While Krakow gets all the invites and accolades -- pretty, special, sweet -- the Polish capital is forgotten, seen as nondescript and cold. But scratch beneath the surface and Warsaw is a dynamic and lovely old gal.

The city's attractions aren't initially obvious, so you have to tease them out -- some of the best bars, for example, are hidden behind unassuming courtyards. Warsaw was largely destroyed during World War II and while the Old Town (Stare Miasto) was lovingly reconstructed brick-by-brick by Varsovians, the rest of the city was largely built up quickly in a gray Modernist style. Those buildings -- long loathed for their Communist design -- are now being heralded. What's more, the city is full of cranes, as expensive new residential spaces like Z??ota 44, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, are being built, and historic properties such as the Hotel Europejski (built in the 1850s and expected to reopen in 2015) are redeveloped.

Praga, long seen as the "wrong side" of the river, is becoming gentrified by attractions like the Soho Factory complex, located at Minska 25, one of the coolest addresses in the entire capital thanks to its art galleries, design firms, theater, shops and a swanky 24-hour restaurant. The city also boasts some fantastic eateries -- including Poland's first Michelin-starred restaurant, Atelier Amaro -- as well as high-end boutique shopping at Vitkac. Art venues and museums are plentiful, and will be added to next week with the opening of the Polin Museum of the History of Polish Jews' permanent collection. Like a pearl, the grit of Warsaw's past and the power of its modern innovation have created something truly worth seeking out.

Fewer-than-expected listeners tune in to Pandora in third quarter

457 words
23 October 2014

(Reuters) - Pandora Media Inc, operator of the leading Internet radio service, reported a lower-than-expected increase in listeners in the third quarter, sending the company's shares down 8 percent in extended trading on Thursday.

Pandora said it had 76.5 million active listeners as of Sept. 30, an increase of 5.2 percent from a year earlier.

Analysts, on average, had expected 76.7 million, according to market research firm StreetAccount.

Total listener hours rose to 4.99 billion from 3.99 billion, but again fell short of the average estimate of 5.02 billion.

"In an increasingly competitive environment, driving monthly active user growth will be more challenging particularly given our already significant market position," Chief Executive Brian McAndrews said on a call with analysts.

"As a result, looking ahead, expecting monthly active user growth at the historic levels is not realistic."

Despite its huge user base, Pandora faces stiff competition in the fast-growing business from services such as Spotify, Sirius XM, Apple Inc's Beats online streaming service, Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc.

Pandora's profit and revenue both beat market expectations, however, as more people listened to streamed music on their mobile phones.

Mobile revenue increased 52 percent to $188 million, while local advertising revenue rose 118 percent to $41.8 million.

DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD

Rising listener numbers are a double-edged sword for Pandora - the more listeners it has, the more it has to pay in royalties to artists and record labels.

SoundExchange, which collects royalties on behalf of artists and labels, offered a proposal last week that could greatly increase Pandora's royalty rates from 2016.

"Pandora has paid more than $1 billion in cumulative royalty payouts, and a highest rate among any form of radio," Chief Financial Officer Mike Herring said on the call.

"We are confident that we have put together the best economic and legal team to represent Pandora and provide a solid, fair and logical argument regarding the (SoundExchange) reproposal," Herring said.

Pandora reported an adjusted profit of 9 cents per share, on revenue of $239.6 million. Analysts on average expected earnings of 8 cents per share on revenue of $238.49 million, according Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company raised its full year revenue forecast to $912 million-$917 million, from $895-$915 million.

It also increased its adjusted net profit estimate to 19-21 cents per share from 16-19 cents.

Pandora's shares were trading at $21.27 after the bell, after closing at $23.12.

World News: Hong Kong: Banker Airs Frustration, Interrupting Live Webcast

A senior J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. banker walking to lunch on Wednesday interrupted a live round table webcast on Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests to express his frustration over the continued street blockage.

David Lau, who heads the U.S. investment bank's China corporate finance division, walked into the interview with protest leaders and a democracy advocate that was being streamed by local paper Apple Daily, live from the Admiralty protest site.

"Hong Kong has many people who are against Occupy Central," said Mr. Lau. "The fact that a majority of people are against Occupy . . . but that you guys continue to occupy the sites, that's most undemocratic of all."

He ignored attempts by the program's host to stop him, and continued speaking for nearly two minutes, though he never lost his cool during the interruption.

Mr. Lau is a veteran banker who has handled many China-related initial public offerings, including the US$2 billion listing in Hong Kong of Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group. He is currently helping handle the US$500 million Hong Kong IPO by Hong Kong Airlines.

Mr. Lau's identity wasn't known to the host and the program guests at the time. "Do you think you're being democratic? There's a show going on and then you just come in to interrupt us," said Martin Lee, founding chairman of Democratic Party, who was one of the guests.

"People are trying to get to work, and you've blocked off the streets. That's not democratic either, is it?" Mr. Lau asks. J.P. Morgan's main offices in Hong Kong are blocks away from the main protest site. "Of course, there are those who support and those against Occupy. I just want to express the views of the silent majority. Thank you everyone," Mr. Lau said, before quickly walking away.

Mr. Lau on Thursday told The Wall Street Journal that he was on his way to a lunch meeting and walked through the protest site. He said he just wanted to express his views, noting that he didn't realize the conversation was being streamed live.

Still, Mr. Lau's comments come even as an opinion poll released this week showed increasing support for the students and less support for their opponents. The poll by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that 38% of respondents supported the protesters in October, up from 31% in September. More significantly, the portion of the population that doesn't support the protesters dropped to 36% from 46% in September.

J.P. Morgan said Thursday that Mr. Lau's comments were his personal opinions and don't represent the bank's views.

Apple, GT Advanced Technologies in Agreement on Sapphire Materials; Apple Supplier to Wind Down Sapphire-Materials Production in Two States

GT Advanced Technologies Inc. and Apple Inc. announced Thursday they reached an agreement on terms for the wind-down of sapphire-materials production in GT¡¦s Mesa, Ariz. and Salem, Mass. locations.

First mentioned in court, the pact is termed a ¡§settlement¡¨ by Apple, which didn¡¦t use sapphire from GT Advanced for its latest-generation smartphones.

In a statement from an Apple spokeswoman, the company said, ¡§Apple put a lot of effort into an ambitious new sapphire-manufacturing process with GTAT which is not ready for production. We¡¦re going to continue evaluating GTAT¡¦s progress on larger sapphire boule development, as well as consider other options for the facility. We remain committed to the city and we¡¦re going to work with Mesa and Maricopa County to help the GT Advanced employees who will be impacted by this find new jobs.¡¨

After filing for Chapter 11 protection Oct. 6 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manchester, N.H., GT Advanced said it would get out of the business of making sapphire materials.

GT Advanced chief executive Tom Gutierrez said in a statement that the company is working ¡§to develop a restructuring plan that will allow us to emerge from Chapter 11 as quickly as possible and with the operating flexibility and resources to position GT for long term success.¡¨

According to a news release from GT Advanced, the settlement with Apple releases GT from ¡§exclusivity obligations under its various agreements with Apple.¡¨ GT will own ¡§production, ancillary and inventory assets located in Mesa¡¨ under the pact. Apple, in return, gets ¡§a mechanism for recovering its $439 million prepayment made to GT.¡¨

At a time when Apple was considering using GT Advanced¡¦s synthetic sapphire material in the screens for its iPhones, the technology giant extended $578 million worth of financing to set GT Advanced up in the business. Some $439 million of the money had been advanced before GT Advanced filed for bankruptcy. Apple used Corning Inc.¡¦s Gorilla Glass for its new iPhone screens.

The settlement also provides that Apple and GT Advanced release all claims against each other. What those claims might be remains to be seen.

GT Advanced Technologies agreed to the settlement weeks into a case where critical court papers remain under seal. Court papers that set out, on the one hand, the reason for GT Advanced¡¦s surprise bankruptcy filing, and, on the other hand, Apple¡¦s position on the relationship between the two companies, were filed under seal.

That has left creditors and shareholders wondering what, if anything, their claims are worth in a bankruptcy that caught them by surprise. A GT Advanced spokesman Thursday did not respond to questions about whether the Chapter 11 proceeding will leave unsecured creditors and shareholders with any value.

Dow Jones & Co, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, U.S. Trustee William Harrington, a Department of Justice lawyer charged with monitoring the bankruptcy courts, and New Hampshire Attorney General Joseph Foster have challenged the secrecy in the case as illegal.

GT Advanced has said terms of its contract with Apple, a contract it has moved to terminate, could expose it to $50 million in damages for breaching confidentiality provisions. Apple has not filed papers explaining what it seeks to protect by keeping the papers under seal. Instead, GT Advanced and Apple struck a settlement that depends on getting a court order striking from the court record all copies of GT Advanced¡¦s explanation of its bankruptcy, and Apple¡¦s position on the contract. The court order will also require anyone in possession of the documents to destroy all copies.

The settlement papers haven't yet been filed with the bankruptcy court, which is being asked to approve them. According to the news release, GT Advanced will file those papers Monday with a hearing on the deal slated for Nov. 25.

Consumer-Brands Firm Posts Slow Sales

Unilever PLC on Thursday warned of a tough global outlook and struck a gloomy tone after reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth in five years, raising fears of a continued economic slowdown across emerging markets.

The maker of Magnum ice cream and Dove shampoo posted third-quarter underlying sales growth of 2.1%, down markedly from 3.2% in the same period a year earlier and marking the Anglo-Dutch consumer-product company¡¦s worst performance since the fourth quarter of 2009.

Underlying sales growth, which was 3.8% in the second quarter, is adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange-rate changes.

¡§It is really tough out there. We have been at pains to say that for a long period of time,¡¨ said Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Hu?t, citing the impact of both price deflation and weak sales demand across key markets.

Revenue in the quarter fell 2% to £á12.2 billion ($15.4 billion), hit by a 2.6% negative currency impact, compared with a market consensus forecast of around £á14 billion. Profit figures weren¡¦t disclosed.

Brazilian Firms Raise Counteroffer to Fyffes

Brazilian firms Cutrale-Safra on Thursday raised their bid for Chiquita Brands International Inc. by an additional 4% as the banana company¡¦s shareholders prepare to vote Friday on its proposed tie-up with Irish food company Fyffes PLC.

Cutrale-Safra, a coalition of a Brazilian orange-juice maker and an investment firm, raised their offer for Chiquita to $14.50 a share, up from the increased offer of $14 a share it made last week. The new bid values the company at $742 million.

Chiquita responded by saying it would carefully review the offer.

Cutrale-Safra first entered the bidding for Chiquita in August with a bid valued at $666 million, or $13 a share. Chiquita¡¦s board has rejected both of Cutrale-Safra¡¦s previous bids as too low.

Cutrale-Safra¡¦s 11th-hour bid came as Chiquita continued to pursue its planned merger with Irish banana grower Fyffes, a tie-up that would create the world¡¦s largest banana seller.

Union Backs Possible Strike Next Month

Unionized workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries late Wednesday endorsed a possible strike over wage and benefit issues, threatening to halt production at the world¡¦s biggest shipbuilding company for the first time in 20 years.

About 18,000 union members, or two-thirds of the South Korean shipbuilder¡¦s total workforce, overwhelmingly voted to walk off the job as early as next month, said union spokesman Kim Hyung-gyun on Thursday.

¡§Despite the vote result, union leaders will try to seek a negotiated wage deal with the management this week. But if the company doesn¡¦t accept our demand, we have no other choice but to go on strike,¡¨ he said.

A company spokesman said both sides would meet later Thursday and intense negations could start as early as Friday.

If workers strike, it will be the first affecting Hyundai Heavy since 1994 when a 63-day stoppage cost it 530 billion won ($522 million).

More Stores to Arrive in China Within Two Years

Apple Inc. plans to increase the number of its Apple-brand retail stores in Greater China to 40 from 15 within two years, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday.

In an interview with Chinese news portal Sina.com, Mr. Cook said the Cupertino, Calif., company will also increase investment in China by an unspecified amount. ¡§In the future, China will become Apple¡¦s biggest revenue contributor,¡¨ he said, according to Sina.com. ¡§It¡¦s just a matter of time.¡¨

An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the remarks. Greater China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.

China is Apple¡¦s third-largest market after the U.S. and Europe and is an important growth driver for the company. Its revenue growth in Greater China, however, slowed sharply in the latest quarter ahead of the release of its new iPhone, which was delayed by regulators in China until this month.

GT Advanced shareholders see value in stock despite bankruptcy

By Nick Brown

Reuters News

Oct 23 (Reuters) - Shareholders of GT Advanced Technologies are lobbying regulators to form a committee to vouch for their interests in the sapphire maker's bankruptcy, believing their shares may still have value.

GT Advanced, which supplied sapphire to Apple Inc, filed for Chapter 11 protection this month under mysterious circumstances, sending shares plummeting.

The case boggled the minds of market analysts when GT refused to explain why it had imploded, citing confidentiality clauses in its Apple contracts.

While shareholders are typically wiped out in bankruptcy, GT Advanced stockholders believe their equity may not be worthless. Some are reaching out to the U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy regulator, the U.S. Trustee Program, asking it to form a committee in GT's bankruptcy to represent shareholder interests.

According to a source close to the effort, law firm Brown Rudnick, which routinely represents creditors in big Chapter 11 cases, is drafting a letter to the Trustee on behalf of a shareholder group requesting a committee.

Other shareholders, like Nathan Cottrell, are working independently. Cottrell, a Philadelphia-based IT salesman, told Reuters he's reached out to the Trustee's office to request a committee and been in touch with law firms about representation.

GT has "a lot of other product lines that are about to start firing up," Cottrell said in an interview on Thursday. "I believe there's value for equity."

The odds may not be in shareholders' favor. Official creditors' committees, appointed by the Trustee and paid for by the debtor, are only formed when the Trustee feels the creditor group in question has a decent shot at recovery.

Since stockholders of bankrupt companies are usually out of the money, equity committees are rare, and shareholders tend not to have a unified voice in Chapter 11 cases.

The company's stock no longer trades on the Nasdaq, but still trades over the counter at a price that currently values GT at $72 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Early in GT's case, company attorney Luc Despins said GT "feels terrible" about the loss to shareholders and "will work every day to recover that value."

The Trustee has yet to make a decision on an equity committee, and a spokeswoman for the office declined to comment on Thursday. Despins, meanwhile, did not return a call seeking comment.

One reason for lingering uncertainty over equity value may be the refusal by GT to disclose the specifics of its downfall, which has drawn the ire of creditors and regulators, the Trustee included.

GT has said it plans to shut down key sapphire operations in Mesa, Arizona, laying off hundreds and reorganizing around a smaller business.

Creditors are hoping for some clarity on the company's financial picture in the coming days, when GT has said it will file a proposed settlement agreement with Apple that may detail its collapse.

Shareholders this month sued the company's officers and directors, accusing them of providing misleading information about stock and bond offerings. (Reporting by Nick Brown; editing by Andrew Hay)

Pandora Media Loss Narrows; Listener Hours Up 25%; Advertising Revenue Rises 44% to $194.3 Million

Pandora Media Inc. reported a 25% increase in the number of hours listeners tuned in during the third quarter, the first year-to-year comparison since the Internet radio giant ended its 40-hour free-listening monthly cap.

Advertising revenue, radio¡¦s bread and butter, rose 44% to $194.3 million, with local advertising more than doubling to $41.8 million from the year-earlier period.

While revenue has been growing strongly, Pandora, which went public in 2011, has struggled to post a profit as listener growth brought along higher royalty fees to music labels and the company faces stiff competition in a crowded field that includes Spotify Ltd., Sirius XM Radio Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.

Pandora has boosted its sales force by about 70 over the past 12 months and on Wednesday launched an analytics tool, AMP, that allows the roughly 125,000 musicians on Pandora to access listener data, such as age and gender, and map where fans are.

On Thursday, Pandora again raised its earnings projection for the year to 19 cents to 21 cents a share on revenue of $912 million to $917 million, from its previous estimate of 16 cents to 19 cents a share on revenue of $895 million to $915 million.

For the current quarter, the company expects a profit of 17 cents to 19 cents a share on revenue of $273 million to $278 million, compared to the Wall Street consensus of 17 cents a share on revenue of $272.8 million.

Overall, the Oakland, Calif., company reported a loss of $2 million, or a penny a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.1 million, or two cents a share. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, Pandora reported a profit of nine cents a share, up from five cents a year earlier.

Revenue rose nearly 42% to $239.6 million.

In July, the company had projected earnings of five cents to eight cents a share for the quarter on revenue of $235 million to $240 million.

Total operating expenses rose 48%.

At quarter¡¦s end, Pandora¡¦s active listeners reached 76.5 million, up 5.2% from a year earlier, while its share of U.S. radio listening in September reached 9.06%, up from 7.77% a year earlier.

Shares, which peaked at $40.44 in March, fell nearly 2% in recent after-hours trading. The company¡¦s stock is down 13% for the year.

Why You Can¡¦t Trust You¡¦re Getting the Best Deal Online; A Study Finds Discriminatory Pricing on E-Commerce Sites Is More Widespread Than Thought

The Web is full of personalized content, whether it¡¦s a Netflix recommendation or the results of a Google search.

But consumers have protested when e-commerce companies have extended their behind-the-scenes personalization to prices, charging different sums for the same goods, or pushing some people toward higher-priced offers.

A new study of top e-commerce websites found these practices¡Xcalled discriminatory pricing or price steering¡Xare much more widespread than was previously understood.

The study, by a team of computer scientists at Northeastern University, tracked searches on 16 popular e-commerce sites. Six of those sites used the pricing techniques; none of the sites alerted consumers to that fact.

Among the study¡¦s findings: Travel-booking sites Cheaptickets and Orbitz charged some users searching hotel rates an average $12 more per night if they weren¡¦t logged into the sites, and Travelocity charged users of Apple Inc.¡¦s iOS mobile operating system $15 less for hotels than other users.

Home Depot Inc. shows mobile-device users products that are roughly $100 more expensive than those offered to desktop-computer users. And Expedia and Hotels.com steer users at random to pricier products, the study said.

¡§In the real world, there are coupons and loyalty cards, and people are fine with that,¡¨ said Christo Wilson, an assistant professor at Northeastern who led the research team. ¡§Here, there¡¦s a transparency problem. The algorithms change regularly, so you don¡¦t know if other people are getting the same results.¡¨

Travelocity, a unit of Sabre Corp., didn¡¦t respond to a request for comment.

Home Depot didn¡¦t dispute the accuracy of the findings, but the home-improvement retailer wasn¡¦t ¡§intentionally steering search results,¡¨ said company spokesman Stephen Holmes.

Many factors could influence what a customer sees on the company¡¦s sites, Mr. Holmes said, including prior browsing and purchase history, the location of the store, and whether the customer is on mobile or not.

Home Depot didn¡¦t charge users different prices for identical products but showed more-expensive products to people who shopped using a smartphone, the researchers found.

Chris Chiames, vice president of corporate affairs at Orbitz Worldwide Inc., said in an email that the company clearly advertises its loyalty programs and other deals. He said the discounts some members see on the site apply to just a small proportion of hotels¡Xfewer than 5%. So, it wouldn¡¦t make sense, and might even be misleading, to advertise lower prices to all members, he said.

¡§The Northeastern study states that ¡¥overall, most of the experiments do not reveal evidence of steering or discrimination,¡¦ and so we are curious as to why a handful of exceptions to searches on thousands of hotels is the basis of this paper¡¦s conclusions, or even worthy of a story,¡¨ Mr. Chiames added. ¡§Would you be as interested in a Kmart ¡¥blue light special¡¦ deal that was made available to shoppers who happen to be in a certain store at a certain time?¡¨

Moreover, some deals are priced by Orbitz¡¦s hotel partners, he added. ¡§The hotel might have limited inventory of that price, and so they choose to display the rate on a more-limited basis, akin to the flash sale,¡¨ he said.

On Orbitz and Cheaptickets, also owned by Orbitz Worldwide, consumers who registered through the websites¡¦ free log-in were shown a tab labeled ¡§members only¡¨ that offered lower hotel prices. The company didn¡¦t advertise that users could receive discounts for logging in.

Orbitz has been accused of price discrimination in the past. A 2012 Wall Street Journal investigation found the company charged Mac users as much as 30% more than PC users for a night¡¦s lodging. The company discontinued the practice, which it characterized as a month-long experiment. The Northeastern researchers confirmed the company no longer discriminates between Mac and PC users.

Expedia and Hotels.com, both units of Expedia Inc., don¡¦t show different prices because of users¡¦ differing characteristics but because the company constantly refines its pricing strategies using a method called A/B testing, the researchers said. Shoppers are randomly placed in a group that highlights either less or more costly hotels. ¡§Either way, the user has no idea what bucket they¡¦ve been placed in,¡¨ said Northeastern¡¦s Mr. Wilson.

One group of users, for example, were shown an average hotel listing price of $187 a night. The other group saw prices that were $17, or roughly 10%, less.

¡§Presenting different booking paths and options to different customers allows us to determine which features customers appreciate most¡¨ said Expedia spokesman Dave McNamee, in an email. ¡§Pricing is not manipulated by Expedia.com.¡¨

Consumers have long protested price discrimination. In 2000, Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos apologized for an internal research program in which consumers were shown different prices for identical products. He called the experiment a ¡§mistake.¡¨ (Amazon and eBay Inc. weren¡¦t included in the Northeastern study because those companies¡¦ services have little power over the prices they charge, the researchers said.)

Staples Inc. varied its online prices based on users¡¦ locations, according to a 2012 article in The Wall Street Journal. The researchers didn¡¦t examine Staples but pointed out that retailers might vary prices by region because the cost of procuring a given product can differ in different parts of the country. They didn¡¦t study geographic variations for that reason.

In their study, the Northeastern researchers devised a statistical method to weed out what they called ¡§noise,¡¨ or legitimate factors that might cause prices to vary¡Xa technique they hope will be used in future studies of online personalization.

The research team recruited 300 beta users, who allowed the researchers to track their experience on different sites.

The team also developed hundreds of fake accounts to see whether historical purchase patterns and clicks through the sites had an impact on price personalization. They didn¡¦t examine the impact of consumers¡¦ overall Web-browsing behavior on pricing because they would have no way to know how e-commerce sites tracked participants across the Web.
