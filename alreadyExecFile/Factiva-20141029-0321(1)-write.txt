SEOUL -- The trading debut of South Korea's ubiquitous mobile-messaging app maker Daum Kakao this month made an instant multibillionaire out of one of its founders, Kim Beom-soo.
But the 48-year-old Mr. Kim, whose stake in the company is now valued at roughly $3.2 billion, is just the most prominent in a growing circle of Korean startup founders who have found success selling their young companies in recent months.
Now through their own venture-capital firms, they are reinvesting their wealth in a new wave of young Korean companies, helping turn the country's startup scene into one of Asia's most active.
In recent months, South Korea's technology scene has also drawn attention from big Silicon Valley companies like Google Inc. and Facebook Inc., whose founder Mark Zuckerberg has visited the country twice in two years, including last week. Google is opening a 20,000-square-foot startup center in Seoul to nurture domestic startups and give them more global exposure.
In the past, South Korea's startups struggled to connect with users outside the country. But the current crop of young entrepreneurs, many of whom have studied outside Korea, are starting companies with global ambitions. They are also getting more help from government programs that match private investments with public grants.
South Korea is beginning to see signs of a dynamic startup environment, says Jimmy Rim, a 35-year-old venture capitalist who worked for the Korea-focused venture-capital arm of Japan's SoftBank Corp. before leaving in 2012 to start a venture-capital firm called K Cube Ventures with Mr. Kim.
"When I started out in 2007, the atmosphere was very bad," Mr. Rim says. "There weren't that many investors at the early stage; venture capitalists weren't willing to invest, or they even wanted collateral from the companies to get their money out. There were no potential buyers."
That is no longer a problem. So far this year, venture-capital investment in Korea's tech industry has reached $198 million, more than four times that of 2012, according to the Asian Venture Capital Journal. That is a much more dramatic rate of growth than in the larger neighboring countries of Japan and China even though, in value terms, it still lags behind Japan's $370 million and China's $3.3 billion.
Through one program, called TIPS, or Tech Incubator Program for Startups, South Korea's Small and Medium Business Administration magnifies startup investments made by venture capitalists whose firms have won designation as qualified investors. For example, if an investor makes a $10,000 investment, the government can pitch in with a fivefold grant of $50,000 -- up to a maximum of $500,000.
Yoon Se-myung, a senior official who helps oversee the program, says the policy was modeled on one run by Israel's government, and could provide a blueprint for how the South Korean government -- eager to help nurture an economy that relies less on its conglomerates -- doles out money to startups in the future.
Relying in part on leverage from the government, Mr. Kim's K Cube Ventures has invested in companies like Frograms Inc., maker of an online movie-recommendation engine, and Greenmonster Inc., whose journaling service Flava has attracted 1.2 million users. Mr. Kim declined to be interviewed for this article.
K Cube Ventures has also invested in an interest-based community website called Vingle, started by Changseong Ho and his wife Jiwon Moon, which now has four million monthly visitors from 105 countries and has content in 26 languages from Indonesian to Portuguese.
Last September, Mr. Ho and Ms. Moon, who started their own company while earning their master's degrees in the U.S., sold Viki, the video-sharing website they founded in 2007, to Japan's e-commerce operator Rakuten Inc. for $200 million.
Now, Mr. Ho and Ms. Moon's fund, called TheVentures, makes investments of its own, of between $50,000 and $200,000, in domestic startups. For example, they have invested in Bridge Mobile, a startup that builds a platform on free Internet-based mobile-phone calls, and houses the company in a shared workspace in Seoul's Gangnam district.
Meanwhile, Ryu Jung-hee, an engineering Ph.D. who like Mr. Ho passed up a company job to start a string of companies, sold Olaworks Inc., a facial-recognition company that he founded in 2006, to Intel Corp. for about $30 million in 2012.
In April, Mr. Ryu plowed his earnings into a startup accelerator called FuturePlay, targeting companies that center around "deep technology," built on doctoral-level engineering, like facial- and voice-recognition technology.
FuturePlay's strategy is to persuade midcareer engineers to leave cozy jobs at the country's large technology firms, Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc., to pursue their startup dreams -- in part, by offering them the security of a year's salary while building their company in-house at FuturePlay, before spinning off their ideas as a separate legal entity. FuturePlay takes an equity stake in the new companies.
FuturePlay has two lawyers, including an intellectual-property specialist, on staff to protect its startups' ideas from the get-go, says Mr. Ryu.
One of the biggest advantages Messrs. Ho and Ryu can offer, they say, is expertise in going global -- a key aim for companies that TheVentures and FuturePlay invest in.
For Mr. Ho and Ms. Moon's Viki, which allows volunteer translators to subtitle dramas and television programs for fans in their own countries, for example, the founders had a global vision from the beginning. At the end of 2013, Viki said it had more than 26 million viewers each month.

UPDATE 2-Broadcom 3rd-quarter results beat views, stock jumps

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Broadcom posted third-quarter results on Tuesday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations as the chipmaker focused on networking and smartphone chips, sending its shares 5 percent higher.
Broadcom, whose wifi connectivity chips are used in Apple's iPhones, reported third-quarter revenue of $2.26 billion, up 5.3 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected third-quarter revenue of $2.17 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company said it saw strength in broadband and connectivity chips in the quarter. Broadcom may have received a boost from brisk sales of Apple's newest smartphones, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said.
In the third quarter, Broadcom had a net profit of $98 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with a net profit of $316 million, or 55 cents a share, last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were 91 cents in the third quarter. Analysts on average expected 84 cents.
It said revenue in the fourth quarter would be $2.0 billion to $2.15 billion, with the midpoint of its forecast at $2.075 billion.
Analysts on average had expected third-quarter revenue of $2.17 billion and fourth-quarter revenue of $2.11 billion.
Broadcom's report comes as the company winds down its money-losing cellular baseband chip business. Broadcom struggled to compete against larger rival Qualcomm Inc, which has a major lead in 4G cellphone technology increasingly used in smartphones.
Getting out of baseband frees up cash to return to shareholders and lets Broadcom concentrate on its better-performing networking and broadband businesses. However, that may leave the chipmaker at a competitive disadvantage selling its wifi chips in the smartphone market.
As well as Apple, the Irvine, California, company supplies wifi chips for Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S5 and other high-end handsets.
Broadcom's stock rose about 5 percent in extended trading after closing up 2.84 percent at $37.33 in regular Nasdaq trade. (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Chris Reese, Bernard Orr and Andre Grenon)

* Q3 revenue up 12 pct to $320.2 mln, short of market forecast
* Predicts strengthening royalty growth after missing Q3 target
* Shares give up early gains (Adds CFO comment, analyst, context, shares)
By Paul Sandle
LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - British chipmaker ARM Holdings' predictions of improving smartphone demand and strengthening royalty growth met with a cool stock market response after it fell short of third-quarter revenue expectations on Tuesday.
The company that provides the technology that powers the iPhone 6 pointed to Apple's booming sales, but investors will take more convincing over long-term prospects in the face of slowing demand for high-end smartphones from the likes of Samsung Electronics.
The strongest part of the market is in cheaper mobile handsets from Chinese manufacturers, containing older ARM technology that commands lower royalty rates.
ARM's shares, which had fallen 14 percent since the launch of the iPhone 6 on Sept. 9, rose as much as 4 percent in early trading but by 1013 GMT were down 4.7 percent at 811 pence.
Analysts at Liberum said they remained cautious on the stock, expecting royalty growth to be weaker than current market expectations.
Shorter-term prospects were buoyed, however, by news from Apple late on Monday of a better than expected 16 percent jump in sales of the iPhone, which uses ARM's latest 64-bit technology.
ARM recognises royalty revenue a quarter in arrears, so the iPhone numbers will not be seen in its results until the next quarter and the first quarter of 2015.
Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said strong iPhone sales were "helpful" in underpinning the short-term outlook for royalty revenues, supported by data from ARM's other chipmaking partners.
"We certainly have seen an uptick in mobile," he told reporters, adding that he expected group dollar revenues for the fourth quarter to be in line with market expectations of about $350 million.
INVENTORY BACKLOG
But weakness in processor royalties, which it receives on every chip shipped by its partners, remains a concern as the consumer electronics industry works through a backlog of inventory amid the faltering economic recovery in many markets.
Score said that acceleration in processor royalty growth would continue as more of ARM's latest technology is deployed in consumer products. Royalties grew 11 percent in the third quarter, he said, and would increase in the mid-teens in the final quarter, with growth continuing into 2015.
While an improvement on the third quarter, the predicted recovery is still short of the 19 percent or so royalty growth it had forecast at the start of the year.
The third-quarter royalty income contributed to a miss on top-line revenue measured in dollars, which was up 12 percent to $320.2 million against market expectations of $326.3 million.
Favorable currency movements, however, meant revenue in pounds was in line with expectations while cost control helped to lift pretax profit 9 percent to 101.2 million pounds ($163.4 million), broadly in line with expectations. (1 US dollar = 0.6192 British pound)

Sony Is Looking to Cut Smartphone Sales Target Again

TOKYO¡XSony is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday, as the business struggles to perform as expected in the face of fierce competition especially in emerging markets.
The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43 million for the 12 months to the end of March 2015. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50 million, which many analysts said was too optimistic.
The planned move stems from Sony¡¦s plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets.
Sony disappointed investors in September when it announced it would write down ?180 billion ($1.68 billion) of the smartphone segment¡¦s business value and lowered the earnings forecast for the current business year to a ?230 billion net loss, almost five times what it said previously.
For Sony watchers, the latest plan won¡¦t come as much of a surprise, as company executives, including chief executive Kazuo Hirai, have been signaling it will downsize its smartphone business in some countries after concluding that introducing entry-level models for emerging markets was a mistake. Sony plans to hold a meeting with investors in November, and Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said details of how it will update the smartphone business plan would be unveiled there.
Sony¡¦s Xperia smartphone business was once a star player for the company, but is now experiencing trouble. It has been hit by the emergence of Chinese makers of cheap handsets, while it continues to struggle in competition against market leaders such as Apple and Samsung.
The Xperia will remain a core business for the company along with image sensors and the gaming business, but Mr. Yoshida has said at news conferences that the smartphone segment will focus on high-end models and won¡¦t seek a major share of the global market.
Mr. Hirai said in September that Sony would cut 1,000 employees, or 15% of the global smartphone business workforce, by March. Some analysts said the cut wasn't enough to turn around the segment.
Sony announces its earnings result for the July-September period on Oct. 31. While analysts expect a net loss due to the ?180 billion smartphone charges, they say it is unlikely the company will again revise down the earnings forecast for the year for the company as a whole.
New York hedge-fund firm Third Point LLC, which unsuccessfully sought a partial spinoff of Sony¡¦s entertainment business, said Tuesday said that it had sold its stake in Sony for a return of nearly 20%, saying in a letter to its investors that ¡§more urgency¡¨ was necessary to ¡§definitively turn around the company¡¦s fortunes.¡¨

NSA Approves Some Mobile Devices
Samsung Electronics Co. said the U.S. National Security Agency approved several of its mobile devices for use by government officials to carry classified information, a positive step for the smartphone maker¡¦s struggling mobile division.
The development comes as Samsung continues to work slowly but persistently to boost its appeal in the enterprise market by clearing the technological hurdles to ready Galaxy devices for corporate and government customers with high-security needs. The company has long believed that winning certifications from top security authorities will help persuade corporate clients to switch to Samsung phones from those made by rivals like BlackBerry Ltd.
Samsung¡¦s mobile security platform, called Knox, allows users to have a virtual ¡§container¡¨ within their smartphones, which separates work and personal apps.
Samsung said on Tuesday that the NSA approved the Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note 3 smartphones and the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, among others, for use. On the same list of approved devices is Boeing Co.¡¦s Boeing Black phone.

EU Charges Honeywell,
European Union regulators filed formal charges Tuesday against Honeywell International Inc. and DuPont Co. over their agreements to produce the only car coolant that meets new EU rules on greenhouse-gas emissions.
The European Commission, the EU¡¦s top antitrust regulator, said deals between the two companies to produce the chemical, known as R-1234yf, ¡§may have limited its availability and technical development, in breach of EU antitrust rules.¡¨
The move steps up a probe opened in 2011 that targeted Honeywell and DuPont¡¦s pact to produce a new refrigerant for vehicle air-conditioning systems, which was developed to replace a refrigerant that had fallen foul of new EU anti-global warming rules.
If the companies are found guilty of illegal collusion, they could face fines of up to 10% of annual sales.

German Company in Talks to Sell Hearing-Aid Unit
Germany¡¦s Siemens AG is in advanced talks to sell its hearing-aid business, which could be valued at up to £á2 billion ($2.55 billion), according to people familiar with the matter.
Private-equity firm Permira Holdings is bidding for the hearing-aid unit by itself, while rival EQT Partners, based in Stockholm, may form a consortium with hearing-aid maker GN Store Nord A/S to acquire the assets, the people said.
Bloomberg previously reported that EQT is the front-runner to acquire the business, but Permira and Denmark¡¦s GN Store Nord were also interested bidders.
An outright sale of the hearing-aid unit isn¡¦t a foregone conclusion, however, given that bankers previously said Siemens¡¦ asking price of around £á2 billion is expensive.
It is unclear whether bidders are willing to pay that, one of the sources said.

Improved Sales Don¡¦t Rev Up Profit for Bike Maker
Harley-Davidson Inc. reported strong retail sales of its motorcycles and better-than-expected profit for the third quarter.
World-wide retail sales at Harley dealers in the latest quarter grew 3.8% from a year earlier, a performance that analysts considered strong because 2013¡¦s third quarter was unusually robust, benefiting from the introduction of the Rushmore line of motorcycles. The latest figures also were a huge improvement from the second quarter, when retail sales were flat.
Despite the improved retail sales, Harley¡¦s profit fell 7.8% in the third quarter to $150.1 million, or 69 cents a share, down from $162.7 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue, including financial services, slipped 3.1% to $1.30 billion.

ARM Wrestles With a Smartphone Slowdown; Deteriorating Trends May Prove Too Much for ARM¡¦s Strength

ARM faces another leg down.
With its stock down by one-quarter so far this year, U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings moved on Tuesday to reassure investors that royalty revenues¡Xits bread and butter¡Xare in good shape. Investors disagreed, a situation not helped by the fact that ARM¡¦s shares were still trading at a heady 27 times 2015 earnings. The stock plunged another 5%.
ARM, which reported quarterly results on Tuesday, is doing all the right things: It is hanging on to its 95% market share in intellectual property for mobile chips while doubling its estimated market share in enterprise networks and servers to about 10% this year. The number of ARM-designed chips embedded in machine-to-machine devices rose by 55% year-over-year, accounting for about one-third of the company¡¦s total shipped in the third quarter.
But any progress may not be fast enough to outrun deteriorating trends, including a slowdown in the smartphone industry that may continue into 2015. ARM is highly leveraged to the latter. For every percentage point of growth in smartphone demand, the company estimates its underlying royalty revenue increases by twice as much. Of the processors on which ARM earns a royalty, about half go into mobile devices.
Sanford C. Bernstein estimates that the high end of the smartphone market has flattened from a 23% growth rate in 2013. Low-to-mid-range smartphone markets should see faster growth in the next few years, but the potential royalty opportunity for ARM is only about one-quarter to half as much per chip, the company estimates.
ARM¡¦s royalty revenue increased by about 5.5% for the first three quarters of this year compared with 23% for the same period in 2013. ARM stands to start benefiting from strong sales of the iPhone 6, but that will likely be partially offset by disappointing shipments of Samsung Electronics¡¦ high-end smartphones.
Royalty revenues have missed consensus estimates for the past five quarters. Although the shortfall has been small, investors are running out of patience. Royalty revenue per chip fell 8% in the latest quarter, year over year. If it keeps declining, ARM will have to turn to volume to deliver growth. This is where its high stock multiple leaves little room for error.
Continued growth in nonmobile revenues should eventually help ARM ride out cycles in the smartphone market. For now, the stock doesn¡¦t look like a smart bet.

China¡¦s Xiaomi May Make Cellphones in India; Xiaomi Has Hired Legal Advisers to Investigate the Regulatory Aspects of Manufacturing in India

BANGALORE, India¡XXiaomi Inc., China¡¦s best-selling cellphone maker, is thinking of manufacturing its handsets in India.
The company¡Xwhich sells more smartphones than even Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. in China¡Xjust started selling its phones in India in July. Its early sales figures have been strong enough that it is already considering manufacturing in Asia¡¦s third-largest economy, said Manu Jain, the head of Xiaomi¡¦s Indian arm.
¡§We always thought that our manufacturing would be based out of China,¡¨ Mr. Jain said. ¡§But India is beginning to become so important for us that we started to think whether we should set up our own manufacturing.¡¨
Mr. Jain said it would take at least six months before Xiaomi can decide whether making handsets in India makes sense.
Earlier this month Nokia Corp. decided to suspend manufacturing at its cellphone factory in southern India amid a continuing dispute with the country¡¦s tax authorities. The tax battle prevented Nokia from selling the plant¡Xonce one of the Finnish company¡¦s largest factories¡Xto Microsoft Corp.
Xiaomi has hired legal advisers to investigate the regulatory aspects of manufacturing in India, said Mr. Jain.
Xiaomi has been making waves in the India cellphone market using sudden online sales and high-end handsets priced close to cost. In its four months in India, Xiaomi has already sold more than 500,000 phones in India.
That is still only a small slice of the market in India where more than 200 million cellphones are sold each year, making it the world¡¦s second largest market after China¡¦s.
While only around one fifth of the new phones sold in India are smartphones, Mr. Jain expects smartphones to account for a majority of the phones sold in the South Asian nation the next three years.

IPhone 6 Recharges Apple's Growth

A year ago, the story line around Apple Inc. was that its formidable growth had petered out and Samsung Electronics Co. was eating its lunch. What a difference a year makes.
Driven by booming sales of its new bigger-screen iPhones, Apple on Monday said its quarterly profit rose 13%, and it predicted record holiday sales in the current three-month period.
Meanwhile, Samsung's approach of offering smartphones at all sizes and prices in every market is struggling amid a wave of Chinese manufacturers with low-cost offerings.
Apple's resurgence is driven by the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which the company introduced in September. The iPhone 6 with a 4.7-inch screen and the iPhone 6 Plus with a 5.5-inch display are in short supply. With its latest phones, Apple is catching up with Samsung and others that have posted strong sales of larger phones.
In an interview, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the reception for the new iPhones has been better than expected with combined sales of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus exceeding same-period sales of last year's iPhone 5S -- Apple's high-end model at the time -- in every market where the phones were available. The larger iPhone 6 Plus sells for $100 more than the 5S did last year.
"We knew it would be good, but it's selling faster than even we thought," said Mr. Cook. "It's clear that this is a big one."
Apple said it sold 39.3 million iPhones in the period ended Sept. 27, a 16% increase from 33.8 million units in the year ago period. Analysts had predicted that Apple would sell 37.8 million iPhones in the period.
Mr. Cook said the company still sees "a significant backlog" for new iPhones. Apple just began selling the new iPhones in China, the world's biggest smartphone market, on Friday.
"The company is gaining momentum heading into the holiday season," said Bill Kreher, technology analyst for Edward Jones. He warned, however, that the phone's success will create "difficult comparisons" in the current fiscal year.
Apple's results also benefited from record sales of its Macintosh line of personal computers, which are growing even as PC sales shrink. Apple said Mac sales rose 21% by units and 18% by revenue. Meanwhile, research firm IDC said global PC sales fell by 1.7%.
The iPhone's strength is in contrast to sluggish iPad sales. Apple said it sold 12.3 million iPads in the period, down from 13.1 million a year ago, marking the third consecutive quarter in which sales declined, compared with the prior year.
As laptops become lighter and smartphones becomes larger and more capable, tablet computers are feeling the squeeze. Apple refreshed its iPad lineup last week and introduced a thinner, more powerful iPad Air 2 with a Touch ID fingerprint reader.
The iPhone's strength stands in contrast to the problems gripping Samsung's smartphone business. Samsung is forecasting a fourth straight quarter of falling operating profit for the period that ended in September.
The Korean electronics conglomerate sold more phones in the third quarter, but margins were weighed down by higher marketing costs and a decline in average selling prices.
Samsung still sells twice as many smartphones as Apple, but Apple generates more profit, according to financial-services firm Canaccord Genuity.
Apple said fiscal fourth quarter net income totaled $8.47 billion, compared with $7.51 billion in the year-ago period. Earnings per share rose more sharply, to $1.42 from a split-adjusted $1.18, because the company's stock-repurchase program reduced the share count by roughly 400 million shares, or 6%. The buybacks boosted earnings per share by nine cents.
Apple said it bought back $17 billion worth of stock during the September quarter. Earlier this month, activist investor Carl Icahn sent Mr. Cook a letter urging the company to buy back more shares because he considered the company's stock undervalued. Apple made its share purchases before Mr. Icahn's letter.
Revenue rose 12% to $42.12 billion from $37.47 billion in the same period a year earlier.
Analysts, on average, estimated that Apple would post earnings of $1.31 a share on revenue of $39.87 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.
For the current quarter to December, Apple is forecasting revenue of $63.5 billion to $66.5 billion. The higher number would exceed Apple's revenue in the fiscal year ended September 2010.
Apple said its gross margin, a closely watched indicator of profitability reflecting the percentage of revenue that remains after manufacturing costs, was 38% in the September quarter -- at the high end of the company's estimate range of 37% to 38%. For the December quarter, Apple forecast a gross margin of 37.5% to 38.5%.
Apple shares rose 1.4% in after-hours trading, after climbing $2.09, or 2.1% to $99.76, in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

SEOUL, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The children of the Samsung Group's patriarch do not plan to sell their shares in an IPO by Cheil Industries Inc, the de facto holding company for South Korea's largest conglomerate,  a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.               
Cheil Industries is expected to be the key vehicle through which the Lee family will retain control of the Samsung Group. Lee Kun-hee, family patriach and chairman of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, has been hospitalised since May following a heart attack, adding urgency to the process of transferring control.               
Analysts had speculated that his three children may seek to sell some of their shares to help pay for an inheritance tax bill that may come in north of $6 billion when the elder Lee dies. Share sales could still come after the IPO.               
Even without selling shares, the up to $1.4 billion IPO will allow son Jay Y. Lee and sisters Lee Boo-jin and Lee Seo-hyun more financial flexibility as they will be able to use those shares as collateral to borrow money.               
Preliminary plans show the IPO will result in some dilution of the children's combined holding in Cheil to just below 39 percent from about 42 percent, the source said.               
Other Cheil shareholders will sell around 18.74 million shares while 10 million new shares will be issued. An indicative price range of 45,000 won to 53,000 won per share has been set, the source said.               
The pricing figures were in line with previous information given by sources.               
A spokesman for Cheil, which changed its name from Samsung Everland Inc in July, declined to comment on IPO terms. Cheil means "No.1' in Korean.               
While the roadmap to succession remains unclear, analysts believe Samsung Group could pursue all-stock mergers of sister companies or transfer assets between group firms to streamline the chaebol's structure and strengthen the younger Lee's control in key firms including Samsung Electronics.               
Cheil shareholders expected to sell part of their stakes include Samsung SDI Co Ltd, which is likely to sell 5 million shares, the source said. That would be equivalent to about half its 8 percent stake.               
Samsung Card Co Ltd and KCC Corp are also expected to sell shares, he added.

WSJ.D Technology: Phone Parts for China Lift Makers From Japan
By Eric Pfanner   
880 words
21 October 2014
The Wall Street Journal

KYOTO, Japan -- China's smartphone boom is being fueled by an unlikely source: Japanese parts makers.
Upstart Chinese phone makers like Xiaomi Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. are increasingly undercutting smartphone giants like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. with high-performance, low-cost handsets.
A significant portion of those handsets' guts -- as much as 50% by value, in some cases -- is made by Japanese companies like Murata Manufacturing Co. or TDK Corp. Those parts range from displays and Wi-Fi modules to tiny, energy-storing ceramic capacitors.
"Almost all cellphone manufacturers are our customers," said Tsuneo Murata, president of Murata, which makes capacitors and other components. "The pie for the component demand is growing."
The parts sales are a rare bright spot in Japan's gloomy electronics industry, and China's smartphone market -- the world's largest and growing at 19% a year, according to Counterpoint Research -- is a big factor. Sales there are being fueled by cutthroat competition among dozens of brands, some of which offer smartphones at less than $100. Lower prices mean smaller budgets for parts, but Japanese suppliers often provide a larger share of components to Chinese brands than to Apple or Samsung, analysts say.
In the second quarter of this year, Xiaomi leapfrogged Apple and Samsung to become the best-selling smartphone provider in China, says research firm Canalys. Counterpoint says Chinese brands will capture about three-quarters of the domestic market this year, in terms of volume, up from one-third in 2010.
Chinese companies are boosting purchases of Japanese parts as they push beyond the domestic market, in order to upgrade their phones.
In some Chinese-branded phones, Japanese suppliers provide up to half of the parts by value, said Daiki Takayama, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Another Chinese smartphone maker, ZTE Corp., buys displays from Sharp Corp. of Japan for its high-end phones, along with camera modules from Sony Corp., said Lu Qianhao, head of ZTE's handset marketing strategy. He cited technological know-how and quality control as advantages of Japanese suppliers.
By contrast, Japanese suppliers account for about one-third of the bill of materials for the latest iPhones, and less than that for Samsung phones, said Shoji Sato, an analyst at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.
Even phone-screen maker Japan Display Inc., whose shares sank last week after it predicted a loss this fiscal year because of delays in shipments to Apple, says it expects sales to Chinese smartphone makers to nearly triple to <yen>180 billion ($1.68 billion) during the same period.
Japan Display makes liquid-crystal displays for smartphones and tablet computers, one of the most competitive areas in the parts business, in which rivals like LG Display Co. of South Korea have been making inroads. Suppliers like Murata that dominate hard-to-copy niches are doing better.
Murata, which is based in Kyoto, built on a long tradition of ceramics-making to hone its specialization in capacitors and related components.
The company's latest capacitors aren't much bigger than a grain of sand, but they contain about 100 layers of ceramics, and Murata uses proprietary methods to make them.
"It's like making a good mille-feuille,"" Mr. Takayama said. "You can buy a very high-quality egg, the best vanilla essence or whatever, but nobody else knows how to mix it or how long to bake it."
Because Murata is the world's largest supplier of capacitors for phones, with a 35% share, it can assure manufacturers of a reliable supply, analysts say. That is important given the tight schedules of the smartphone business.
Capacitors cost pennies or less, but state-of-the-art handsets contain 700 to 800 of them -- three or four times as many as in previous generations of smartphones, Murata says.
Mr. Sato estimated Murata sells $2 to $3 worth of parts to most Chinese smartphone makers per handset. Given that Xiaomi alone has forecast shipments of 60 million phones in 2014 and 100 million next year, that is a solid source of revenue. Apple buys $9 to $10 worth of Murata parts for each iPhone, Mr. Sato estimated.
Murata's sales of parts to smartphone makers and other suppliers of communications gear rose about 90% over the past five years, to 430 billion yen in the year ended March 31, boosting overall sales by about 60%, to 847 billion yen.
The Kyoto area, also home to parts makers like Rohm Semiconductor, Nidec Corp. and Kyocera Corp., has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Chinese smartphone boom. TDK, which is based in Tokyo and makes capacitors and other parts, says its sales to Chinese smartphone makers rose 50% in the April-June quarter.
The push to automate smartphone plants in China is providing a further boost to Japanese suppliers. Fanuc Corp., a maker of industrial robots that is based in the shadow of Mount Fuji, in September upgraded its forecast for sales and earnings in the financial year ending in March by 29% and 26%, respectively.

China to pitch high-speed trains to California

* State-backed China CNR Corp to bid to sell high-speed trains               
* China has world's longest high-speed train network               
* California seeking expressions of interest by Oct. 22               
* $68 bln project seeks up to 95 trains as fast as 354 kph               
By Brenda Goh               
SHANGHAI, Oct 21 (Reuters) - State-backed China CNR Corporation  is making a pitch to sell its high-speed trains to California, signalling China's growing export ambitions for such technology after building the world's longest network in just seven years.               
It marks the first concrete attempt by China to sell high-speed locomotives abroad and establish itself as a credible rival to sector leaders such as Germany's Siemens, Canada's Bombardier and Japan's Kawasaki.               
CNR, its unit Tangshan Railway and U.S.-based SunGroup USA are submitting an expression of interest to California's $68 billion high-speed rail project for a contract to supply up to 95 trains that can travel as fast as 354 kilometres per hour (221 miles per hour), SunGroup told Reuters.               
"We believe that high-speed rail is something that China does very well, and it's a product that we can export across the world," SunGroup spokesman Jonathan Sun said in a phone interview, adding that SunGroup, CNR and Tangshan Railway had been working together for four years.               
Manufacturers are expected to send in expressions of interest by Oct. 22 to the California High Speed Railway Authority, which will later issue formal requests for proposals. About a dozen firms from places such as Japan and Spain are expected to compete, it said.               
California has been candid about its desire for Chinese investment in the 800-mile-long (1,287 kilometres) line from Los Angeles to San Francisco; U.S. media reports said governor Jerry Brown met Chinese rail officials in April last year, including those from Tangshan Railway, to discuss the project.               
No estimates for the contract's value have been published, but in its 2014 business plan the California High Speed Railway Authority estimated each trainset would cost $45 million, based on a purchase of 70 vehicles.               
"We haven't officially gone out to bid yet. This is us saying to the industry that we need trainsets. They have to meet these standards. We're asking, 'Are you interested in learning more, and do you think you could do this for us?'" said Lisa Marie Alley, deputy director of public affairs at the High-Speed Rail Authority.                              
LOFTY AMBITIONS               
China has made no secret of its desire to export its high-speed technology abroad, having built over 12,000 kilometres of track at home in less than a decade. CNR and CSR Corp  are China's largest locomotive makers, while China Railway Construction  and China Railway Group  build track.               
The country has helped or indicated its interest to build thousands of kilometres of high-speed track in countries such as  Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, though it has yet to sell a high-speed train abroad. Premier Li Keqiang - dubbed by local media as China's high-speed rail salesman - has led a drive to promote its technology in Thailand, Britain, Russia and India.               
A Chinese consortium was the only competitor to present a  bid for a tender to build a 210-km high-speed rail line in Mexico, the Mexican government said last week.               
"The Chinese market right now is booming, and there's a very high level of investment, but five, 10 years down the road will it still be at this level? We don't know. So it makes sense for these companies to want to diversify their revenue streams," Barclays analyst Yang Song said.               
The sector's image was, however, marred by a 2011 collision between two high-speed trains near Wenzhou in Zhejiang province that killed 40 people and was later blamed on design flaws.               
Project details published on SunGroup's website show the consortium is putting forward the CRH380BL train, a model used on the Beijing-Shanghai line, which can travel up to 380 kph.               
Sun said an initial order would probably be about 18-20 trains and that they would open a factory to make the trains in California if they won the bid, as required by U.S. law.               
The consortium also intends to bid for the next available contracts to build track sections of the line. A group led by Tutor Perini is building the first segment, while consortiums that include Dragados and Samsung are bidding for the next construction package.

Samsung Gets NSA Approval on Some of Its Devices; Galaxy Note 4 Is Among the Devices Cleared to Carry Classified Information

SEOUL--Samsung Electronics Co. said Tuesday the U.S. National Security Agency approved a number of its mobile devices for use by government officials to carry classified information, a positive step for the smartphone maker¡¦s struggling mobile division.
The development comes as Samsung continues to work slowly but persistently to boost its appeal in the enterprise market by clearing the technological hurdles to ready Galaxy devices for corporate and government customers with high-security needs. The company has long believed that winning certifications from top security authorities will help persuade corporate clients to switch to Samsung phones from those made by rivals like BlackBerry Ltd.
Samsung¡¦s mobile security platform, called Knox, allows users to have a virtual ¡§container¡¨ within their smartphones, which separates work and personal apps.
Samsung said the NSA approved the Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note 3 smartphones and the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, among others, for use. On the same list of approved devices is Boeing Co.¡¦s Boeing Black phone.
In June, Samsung said five of its Knox-installed Galaxy smartphones and tablets received approval from the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency. The approval added the devices to a list of options for officials. The Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Note 3 smartphones are also on this list.
Whether these approvals translate into big deals for Samsung in the enterprise market remain a question, analysts said. In May, a Samsung executive said that 87 million devices come with Knox installed. But among them, just 1.8 million are actively using Knox.
Samsung had explained that the number of clients is rising and the focus will be initially on having a wider distribution. Samsung declined to provide updated figures on Galaxy devices running the Knox system.
Earlier this year, Samsung said its mobile-security platform would be integrated into the next version of Google Inc.¡¦s Android operating system as the two companies bid to increase Android¡¦s appeal among security-minded businesses and governments.
The world¡¦s biggest smartphone maker by shipments said earlier this month its third-quarter operating profit likely fell as much as 62% from a year earlier, hit by weak smartphone sales. This would mark its fourth consecutive decline in operating profit and its steepest year-over-year decline in the past five years.
Samsung, South Korea¡¦s biggest company by market capitalization, is facing stiff competition from Chinese handset makers that are aggressively introducing less costly phones. In the high-end smartphone market, it is battling Apple Inc., which last month unveiled new iPhones with bigger screens that are popular with consumers.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Madison Avenue continues to rush to the Oscars.               
ABC is nearing sell-out of its advertising inventory for its 2015 broadcast of the annual awards from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences, according to two media-buying executives and other people familiar with the situation, even though it is seeking what may be some of the highest prices ever charged for the event.               
ABC is seeking around $1.9 million for a 30-second spot in the program, these people said. The cost of a spot in the most recent broadcast, hosted in March by Ellen DeGeneres, went for between $1.8 million and $1.9 million. The Oscars are set for a Feb. 22 broadcast on ABC with Neil Patrick Harris set to host for the first time and Craig Zadan and Neil Meron reprising their role as producers. Executives from the network could not be reached for comment.               
The slight uptick in ad prices suggests that so-called "event" programming - shows that draw outsize audiences and are only available for a limited duration - has become as important as sports broadcasts as TV-viewing behavior becomes ever more splintered with the rise of time-shifting devices, video streaming and other new technologies. Indeed, NBC is seeking $350,000 or more for 30 seconds' worth of ad time in its coming live broadcast of the play "Peter Pan." The Oscars broadcast typically draws TV's second-biggest primetime audience of the season, resting behind only that generated by the Super Bowl.               
The 86h Oscars reached a 14-year ratings high, with DeGeneres, who took a much-celebrated "selfie" during the show using a phone placed by sponsor Samsung, viewed by an average of 43.7 million people, according to data from Nielsen. In comparison, an average of about 40.4 million watched ABC's 2013 broadcast, hosted by Seth MacFarlane. Total ad revenue generated by ABC's 2013 broadcast came to about $88.3 million, according to Kantar Media, a new high at the time.               
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences limits the amount of advertising allowed to run with the Oscars broadcast, which makes time on the show more scarce. Between nine and 10 minutes of national ad messages run per hour during the Oscars, according to Kantar. The Grammy Awards have run with as many as 14 minutes of commercials per hour.               
Just a few years ago, the Oscars were in something of a post-recession slump. Ad prices in 2009 and 2010 fell as low as $1.3 million to $1.5 million for 30 seconds, as the nation worked itself slowly out of an economic crisis. In 2008, Oscars ads hit a previous high of $1.82 million for a half-minute berth.               
Whether or not the ad prices can stay at current levels will likely hinge on the slate of nominees in the kudoscast in any given year. When the top movies nominated are arty films aimed at older audiences, viewership typically slumps. When the nominees for best films are blockbusters, the ratings increase.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Cyprus-based Ocean Rig UDW Inc said on Monday that it signed a $1.1 billion three-year contract with Brazil's state-run oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, to extend a lease on two ultra-deepwater drilling ships.
Petrobras, as the Brazilian oil company is known, will get the ships, the Ocean Rig Corcovado and Ocean Rig Mykonos, for 1,095 days, Ocean Rig said in a statement. The period and price translate into an average rate for each of the vessels of $502,283 per day.
The Corcovado was expected to earn an average day rate of $464,800 and Mykonos $459,700 in the second half of 2014, according to Ocean Rig's second-quarter financial statements. Ultra-deep water is considered water deeper than 1,500 meters (4,921 feet).
Petrobras is trying to secure drilling equipment to execute one of the world's largest corporate expansion programs. Much of the company's five-year plan to invest $221 billion by the end of 2018 will be focused on drilling in new fields, which is expected to help the company's oil and natural gas liquids output in Brazil rise 53 percent to 3.2 million barrels a day.
In September, Petrobras said it had 39 drill-rigs operating in waters deeper than 2,000 meters. Petrobras officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Nicosia, Cyprus-based Ocean Rig, which operates 13 offshore, ultra-deepwater drill rigs, is 59 percent owned by DryShips Inc , a ship-leasing company based in Maroussi, Greece.
On Monday Ocean Rig also said it had provided DryShips with a $120 million short-term loan to help it pay $700 million of 5 percent convertible notes due Dec. 1, 2014.
The Petrobras agreement boosts the company's expected future ship-lease revenue to $5.5 billion, Ocean Rig's Chief Executive Officer George Economou said in the statement.
The Corcovado and Mykonos are both so-called "sixth-generation" drill ships capable of drilling wells while floating in waters up to 10,000 feet deep (3,048 meters) deep. They were built by Samsung Heavy Industries Shipyard in Korea and launched in 2011.
Ocean Rig also said in the statement that it extended the date by which France's Total SA can agree to one-year renewals of its lease of the Ocean Rig Olympia, now working in Angola, to Feb 27. It can seek a second one-year renewal up to a year after agreeing to the first extension.
Additionally, Ocean Rig said it will pay investors a 19 cent per common share dividend, to be paid on or about Nov. 11 for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Olympia is a sister ship of Corcovado and Mykonos. (Reporting by Jeb Blount and Marta Nogueira)

Taiwan Semiconductor¡¦s Chang on the Evolving Chip Industry; Morris Chang Talks About Preparing for the Internet of Things

Morris Chang, the 83-year-old chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., has made bold bets in the past three decades running the world¡¦s biggest contract chip maker.
He founded Taiwan-based TSMC in 1987 when outsourcing production wasn¡¦t a proven business model in the semiconductor industry. Many chip companies at the time, from Intel Corp. to Texas Instruments Inc., invested billions of dollars in their own chip factories. TSMC¡¦s ¡§foundry¡¨ model of manufacturing chips based on others¡¦ designs, however, challenged this conventional business model.
The outsourcing model soon attracted followers including Santa Clara, Calif.-based GlobalFoundries and China¡¦s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co.
TSMC now is the largest contract manufacturer of computing chips in the world. It has hundreds of clients including Qualcomm Inc., ARM Holdings PLC and Apple Inc. Last year, its revenue totaled almost $20 billion, more than four times what Samsung Electronics Co., the world¡¦s biggest memory-chip maker by revenue, made from contract manufacturing.
But Samsung is coming on strong, and Mr. Chang says TSMC will lose some orders to Samsung next year, when the South Korean chip maker launches its next-generation chip technology. The race will remain heated and is becoming more expensive.
Mr. Chang is also preparing to hand over the reins to his two co-chief executives, CC Wei and Mark Liu.
In an interview at the company¡¦s headquarters in Hsinchu City, south of Taipei, Mr. Chang talked about the challenges TSMC faces. Edited excerpts follow:
Keeping Up
WSJ: At 83, you are one of the rare executives in the tech industry still running a company. How do you keep up with the fast-changing technology, products and market demand?
MR. CHANG: Certainly I don¡¦t make decisions alone. I have experts who advise on technical issues. I have a special team, called the business-development group. They basically tell us and the R&D team what products customers want. Their input is very important to my strategy.
We also have a very realistic market-forecasting group. Now, I still get weekly reports on markets, competition and customers from our vice presidents. Every weekend I spend hours reading reports from them. I¡¦m a very good listener; I get more out of a conversation than most people do.
WSJ: What is the biggest challenge you¡¦re faced with now?
MR. CHANG: Over the next three to five years, we will have to prolong Moore¡¦s law. [Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel Corp., said in 1965 that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years.] We know how to sustain this for the next five years, but after that I don¡¦t know what to do at this point.
WSJ: TSMC has the largest market share among contract chip makers and managed to lift revenue to new highs each year since 2010. What¡¦s key to maintaining competitiveness?
MR. CHANG: You have to be a leader and galvanize resources to take maximum advantage of a changing external environment. If you¡¦re behind by one year, two years, that¡¦s not good.
We¡¦ve pretty much tripled our budget on research and development and have more than doubled our staff over the past five years. Our annual capital spending between 2002 and 2009 stayed at $2.5 billion; since then, it has risen to $10 billion. We try to utilize our equipment fully all the time, which also explains our profitability.
Our share of the global foundry market is expected to rise from 45% in 2012 to 55% in 2015.
Internet of Things
WSJ: How do you think the semiconductor industry will evolve in three to five years?
MR. CHANG: The Internet of Things is all about connectivity. It¡¦s our mission to provide the capacity and technology to all of those so-called IoT devices, including sensors. I imagine semiconductors will be more pervasive than cars. I have no doubt that people will make a good living out of it.
WSJ: How do you retain staff when companies in China and South Korea for example are offering more competitive salaries?
MR. CHANG: Our staff turnover is quite low; it¡¦s less than 5%. That certainly helps build the organization and a stable relationship with customers. We have a pretty good profit-sharing scheme. Taiwan still enjoys a good supply of hardworking, young engineers. We¡¦ve actually hired a few experienced people from outside Taiwan as well to work on a more advanced chip-manufacturing process.
WSJ: Will you consider looking for a successor outside TSMC?
MR. CHANG: I don¡¦t think that will work. People inside TSMC wouldn't like that idea.
WSJ: How do you see the competition?
MR. CHANG: Competition is always heated in technological innovation and will remain so at least over the next three to five years.
Earlier this year, we were honest with our customers and told them our schedule to ramp up on 16-nanometer [16 billionths of a meter] technology will be later than Samsung¡¦s comparable 14-nanometer technology. They appreciated our honesty and made plans accordingly.
So in 2015, Samsung¡¦s market share in the latest production process will be higher than ours, but we will regain market leadership in that segment in 2016. Feedback from customers is good, and that¡¦s why I¡¦m so confident.
China Rising
WSJ: Where will the next round of competition come from?
MR. CHANG: China. The country has the manpower, and it is becoming more talented. Many of them have studied abroad, especially in the U.S. As in the semiconductor industry, the government is heavily subsidizing the sector, and its competitiveness is improving very quickly. Electronics brands like Huawei and Lenovo are also growing as smartphones and tablets are becoming more common, while Internet companies such as Alibaba and Tencent are expanding at a very fast pace.
WSJ: So, how can CEOs prepare for that competition?
MR. CHANG: Technology and patents are a company¡¦s biggest and most important assets, and we should protect them. Selling them for short-term gains is very unwise. Intellectual property is a long-term competitive advantage.

S.Korea economy lifted by switch away from deposit based rentals
By Choonsik Yoo

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
SEOUL, Oct 20 (Reuters) - For a country trying to avoid the menace of deflation, South Korea is receiving timely help from unusual quarters - the country's landlord and their tenants.               
Interest rates at historic lows have wrought a change in   traditional rental contracts that could gradually unleash tens of billions of dollars for more productive uses like consumption and home buying.               
Landlords have for decades operated the "jeonse" rental system, whereby tenants pay a deposit that can be more than half the home's value instead of having to pay a monthly rent.               
There is a huge pool of funds being under utilised. Nomura estimates that there was some $400 billion tied up in jeonse deposits in 2012, equal to one-third of South Korea's annual economic output.               
But the jeonse system appears to be going out of fashion, as most landlords can't make high enough returns from stashing the money in bank deposits paying just 2.5 percent - they will go down again after the central bank lowered its policy rate further last week.               
Using the funds as leverage to further invest in the real estate market holds little attraction for landlords either. Prices have been flat.               
Jeonse accounted for slightly more than half of rentals early this year, sharply down from nearly 70 percent in early 2011, land ministry data showed.               
"The sharp drop in interest rates is the most important factor behind this phenomenon as home owners want to make up for the shrinking income as much as possible," Kim Eun-kyung, a consultant at Samsung Securities said.               
"The jeonse deposit money has mostly been illiquid, but the declining jeonse contracts will turn the money more liquid,  more ready to spend on consumption or paying back loans, although this will happen very gradually," Kim added.               
South Korea's ageing population - the number of working-age people between 15 and 64 will begin shrinking from 2017 - also heralds lower demand for rentals, as typically demand comes from younger people.               
Landlords have responded to the changing market environment by either charging a monthly rental, or asking for a substantially higher jeonse deposit, which should further reduce demand for such rentals.               
Either way, the prospect of less money locked up in the jeonse system, and more becoming available for people to spend, invest, or buy their own homes should be a boon for the economy.               
Young Sun Kwon, an economist at Nomura in Hong Kong and a former official with South Korea's central bank, estimated that renters have borrowed about 64 trillion won ($60 billion) to fund jeonse deposits.               
The trend away from jeonse rentals comes at a good time for Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who fears Asia's fourth-largest economy could go the way of Japan and slip into deflation. The extra money coming into circulation will help his strategy to lift asset prices as a way to boost consumption.               
Lee Yeon-hee, an office worker in her 20s in Seoul, had rented through a jeonse contract, with a deposit of 80 million won, until her landlord demanded an extra 15 million won increase. At the same time, with South Korea's economy slowing, her father's small-scale machine assembly business failed.               
"I couldn't accept the demand for an increased jeonse," Lee said. She now pays a monthly rent of 400,000 won, and has used the returned deposit to pay off a loan and support her parents.                                             
NEW ERA, OUTDATED SYSTEM               
As jeonse rentals have fallen and the benefits of Choi's policies come through, analysts see clear signs that people are using money for more productive purposes, like home buying.               
Home prices have risen for 13 consecutive months and, according to data from Kookmin Bank, have gained 1.41 percent so far this year, following a mere 0.37 percent gain last year and a fall of 0.03 percent in 2012.               
The jeonse system developed decades ago, when banks' lending was focused on financing South Korea's rapid industrialisation, and the mortgage lending market was under-developed in a country emerging from the ravages of post-war poverty.               
The country passed through a long phase of high economic growth, which fuelled inflation, high interest rates and rising property prices, all of which sustained the jeonse system in the past.               
"When the country was short of capital and short of proper retail banking service, the jeonse system contributed a lot to economic development, but times have changed and much of the money does little for economic growth," said Kwon.               
If just 5 percent of money now tied up in jeonse deposits flowed back into consumer spending, it would amount to 20 trillion won, equivalent to 3 percent of annual private consumption, according to Reuters' calculations based on central bank data.               
While the government has not said it wants to abolish jeonse, some officials say in private that waning popularity of the jeonse system was good for the country over the long term.               
"The country should abolish it, and as long as it is done in an orderly manner, it will make big contribution to the economy," said Kwon.

Samsung: Nice Stock if You Can Get It; World¡¦s Leading Chip Maker Is Highly Profitable

A cash-rich Samsung Electronics is one of the most attractive technology stocks in the world.
The South Korean maker of cellphones, tablets, memory chips, display screens and televisions is out of favor in the investment community because of concerns about plunging profits in its mobile-phone division. Investors, however, may be overreacting because the company remains highly profitable thanks to the strength in its semiconductor business. It¡¦s the world¡¦s leading maker of memory chips.
Samsung shares (005930.Korea), which are mainly traded in South Korea, recently fetched 1.12 million won each, or about $1,060, based on an exchange rate of 1,060 won to the dollar. The company has a market value of about $150 billion. Fans point to a flush balance sheet with $60 billion of net cash and investments, equal to 40% of its market value.
Samsung trades for just eight times projected 2014 earnings per share and for about five times earnings excluding the cash. There are few giant companies in the world with such a low valuation. The S&P 500 index trades for 16 times estimated 2014 earnings.
¡§The semiconductor division and the cash are worth more than the current market cap,¡¨ says Mark Newman, an analyst with Bernstein Research. ¡§That means that investors are getting for free the world¡¦s largest maker of handsets, the leading display business and the biggest and most profitable TV producer.¡¨ He has an ¡§outperform¡¨ rating and a price target of 1.65 million won, or nearly 50% above the current share price.
Mr. Newman thinks Samsung¡¦s mobile-phone business should stabilize due to the company¡¦s favorable cost position, world-wide distribution and hardware advantages.
One of Samsung¡¦s strengths is its industry-leading display business. Samsung is expected to be first to market¡Xprobably in 2016¡Xwith cellphones offering foldable displays that open into tablets. Samsung¡¦s innovative technology should soon be on display in the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge ¡§phablet¡¨ whose screen wraps around one edge of the device.
Buying Samsung can be hard for U.S. investors. The company has no U.S.-listed shares and no plans for such a listing. Two brokerage firms, Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch, allow their customers to buy Samsung¡¦s Korean shares, but UBS and Morgan Stanley don¡¦t.
Samsung also has London-listed shares traded in dollars. Each share, now around $530, is equal to half a Korean share. However, the London shares are geared toward U.S. institutions, making it tough for retail investors to buy them. Non-U.S. investors, however, face few restrictions on the London shares.
Investors can get diluted exposure to Samsung through the iShares MSCI South Korea Capped exchange-traded fund (EWY), which has a 20% weighting in Samsung. The Korean market is historically inexpensive, trading for about 12 times forward earnings.

SEOUL¡XWhen Souaib Hanaf arrived just after noon on a recent Sunday at Nexon Arena, just off a busy road in the Seoul neighborhood of Gangnam, several dozen young men had already been waiting outside the e-sports stadium three hours to get the best seats for the afternoon¡¦s big video game championship.
Mr. Hanaf, a 27-year-old French-Moroccan pro gamer who rode show-jumping horses as a teenager, was there to deliver English play-by-play commentary for the finals of the third season of Korea Dota 2 League, or KDL.
Two Korean professional gaming teams¡XMVP Phoenix and Pokerface¡Xbattled in Dota 2, a real-time strategy fantasy game where each of the team¡¦s five players set out to destroy their opponent¡¦s base for a prize of $10,000.
¡§[I] say what¡¦s happening, give some hype to the game, get the spectators excited about it,¡¨ said Mr. Hanaf.
Inside the nearly 1,700-square-meter theater, owned by the South Korean video game company Nexon, the professional gamers, who looked to be in their early 20s and sported team tracksuit pants, t-shirts, and sneakers, got their hair and make-up done. Some fans came in costumes.
Dota 2, developed by the U.S. company Valve Corp., is relatively new to Korean e-sports and has a small presence¡XNexon published it there in October 2013, three months after its official release in the U.S., where it is much more popular.
That final¡Xwhich MVP Phoenix won¡Xwas just a glimpse of what¡¦s expected to be a much more raucous scene this weekend: The sold-out final where a record audience of about 40,000 is expected for Riot Games¡¦ fourth annual international event, the League of Legends World Championship, at Seoul¡¦s Sangam Stadium, a venue of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.
League of Legends¡Xa fantasy strategy game developed by U.S.-based Riot Games, the bulk of which is owned by Chinese company Tencent Holdings Ltd.¡Xis the world¡¦s dominant e-sport. In South Korea alone, the game has around 40% of the country¡¦s online players, according to Gametrics, a website that tracks games played at the nation¡¦s popular Internet caf?s, known as PC bangs.
The tournament matches up the world¡¦s top eight LoL teams. This year¡¦s final will feature China¡¦s Star Horn Royal Club and South Korea¡¦s Samsung White team, which is sponsored by Samsung Electronics.
South Korea and China are the only two countries with their own divisions in LoL tournaments.
¡§[Seoul] is kind of well-known as the birthplace of e-sports,¡¨ said Dustin Beck, vice president of e-sports at Riot Games.
While other regions are catching up, East Asian players remain so dominant that some teams are being stacked with Chinese and Korean players¡Xone Chinese team even moved to North America, where it would face a less competitive regional field.
Buzz that more teams were looking to relocate prompted Riot Games to implement a rule ensuring that five-player LoL teams have at least three members who are actually from the region they represent.
¡§We want to make sure that each regional league maintains the identity of its local region,¡¨ Mr. Beck said. ¡§For example, you can¡¦t just have a Chinese team pick up and move to Europe and potentially represent Europe in a world championship when you have all Chinese players on a team.¡¨
¡§It doesn¡¦t really seem fair on the surface,¡¨ said Erik Lonnquist, an American LoL commentator based in Seoul. ¡§[But] I think it¡¦s fairly necessary to help the North American and European teams grow and cultivate more local talent.¡¨
The LoL final will be broadcast on ESPN3, complete with a live performance by the U.S. band Imagine Dragons. Last year¡¦s final, which was also won by a Korean team, had 32 million viewers online.
Mr. Hanaf¡¦s commentary at the Dota 2 final was broadcast on the video platform Twitch, which Amazon.com Inc. agreed to purchase for $970 million in August. While Nexon Arena¡¦s basement-level spectators¡¦ area was filled to its 260-person capacity, more than 6,000 people watched the broadcasts in Korean, and over 110,000 viewers tuned in to Twitch.
The video game competitions known as e-sports took off around the world more than 15 years ago, but they found mainstream acceptance much more quickly in South Korea. And like another Korean cultural force, K-Pop, video games are big business in the country. Last year, the games industry brought in an estimated $9 billion in revenue according to a senior statistics researcher at the government agency, Korea Creative Content Agency.
Andrew Pender¡Xan Australian pro gaming commentator based in Seoul and a veteran pro gamer¡Xsaid a combination of factors, including the country¡¦s widespread broadband connectivity, rigorous training and a gaming infrastructure of team houses and coaches fueled the growth there.
Some foreigners move to South Korea to practice for a time or do e-sports commentary, or, in rarer cases, like that of Mr. Hanaf, to forge a pro gaming career.
Mr. Hanaf moved to Seoul in 2010 to play in a new league for StarCraft II, the sequel to the popular StarCraft, a real-time space adventure strategy game developed and published by U.S. company Blizzard Entertainment Inc. in the late ¡¦90s.
He had been living in Paris, halfheartedly pursuing a degree in IT, mostly to keep his parents happy, he said. But he¡¦d distract himself with video games, which he was good at, and would get invited to tournaments in Sweden.
The new league gave him the impetus to quit his studies and give pro gaming a shot; Mr. Hanaf said he wanted to compete with the best. The world¡¦s top 16 StarCraft II players, ranked by the World Championship Series held by Blizzard, are all Korean.
Mr. Hanaf achieved some success with StarCraft II, but late last year switched to Dota 2 after he lost his regular training spot in a foreign gamers¡¦ house in Seoul and was reduced to practicing in PC bangs. He most recently played with Team Muhan in the recently concluded Korea Dota 2 League tournament, and isn¡¦t currently with a team.

Pantech Co., a South Korean mobile-phone maker, has sought the protection of a U.S. court as part of its larger restructuring efforts abroad.
The company filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection¡Xthe section of the Bankruptcy Code that deals with international insolvencies¡Xat the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Atlanta Thursday afternoon. If recognized by a U.S. judge, Pantech will receive the benefits of U.S. bankruptcy law, including the so-called automatic stay that halts lawsuits and prevents creditors from seizing assets.
In August, the company filed for the equivalent of Chapter 11 in South Korea after months of trying to restructure its debt.
¡§Ongoing U.S. litigation drains Pantech of its resources and attention away from its rehabilitation efforts,¡¨ the company¡¦s chief executive, Joonwoo Lee, said in court papers filed Thursday.
Pantech listed 14 continuing lawsuits in the U.S., all related to patent disputes.
Pantech relies on sales in South Korea for the majority of its 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion) in annual revenue, but it faces heavy competition and a saturated market. The company was also hit with government restrictions on excessive handset subsidies earlier this year, which resulted in penalties for South Korea¡¦s three mobile carriers, including a 45-day ban on smartphone sales.
¡§Pantech experienced a dramatic drop in domestic sales because the Korea Communications Commission imposed a suspension on Pantech¡¦s customers, the mobile network carriers, in March 2014,¡¨ the company said in court papers.
According to Pantech, that suspension caused a significant strain on its cash flow.
Pantech initiated a restructuring process in March, which led the company to seek ¡§judicially supervised rehabilitation¡¨ at a district court in Seoul in August.
The company, founded in 1991, underwent its first restructuring from December 2006 to December 2011, court documents show.
Until last year, Pantech sold more phones than Apple Inc. in South Korea, making it the country¡¦s third largest phone-maker after Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. Major shareholders included Qualcomm Inc. and Samsung.
Pantech posted an operating loss of 297 billion won in 2013 and an operating loss of 78 billion won in 2012. Those heavy losses have hampered the company in its search for potential buyers.
A timeline for the company¡¦s restructuring hasn¡¦t yet been announced, but the first hearing is scheduled to take place Nov. 7 in Seoul. In its petition for Chapter 15, Pantech listed total assets between $100 million and $500 million and liabilities as high as $1 billion.
The case number is 14-70482. A judge hasn¡¦t yet been assigned.

U.S. FCC to look into new-generation wireless networks

WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - In the words of Buzz Lightyear, and U.S. Federal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel on Friday, U.S. regulators will look "to infinity and beyond" to harness new technology that can help build a new generation of mobile wireless connections.
The FCC on Friday voted unanimously to open a so-called "notice of inquiry" into what it and the industry can do to turn a new swath of very high-frequency airwaves, previously deemed unusable for mobile networks, into mobile-friendly frequencies.
The FCC's examination would serve as a regulatory backdrop for research into the next generation of wireless technology, sometimes referred to as 5G and which may allow wireless connections to carry a thousand times more traffic.
"Today we're stepping in front of the power curve," FCC AaChairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday at the meeting.
In question are frequencies above 24 gigahertz (GHz), sometimes called millimeter waves, that have previously been deemed technically unweildy for mobile connections, though have the potential to carry large amounts of data and give the promise of lightning-fast speeds.
Millimeter waves work best over short distances and have required a direct line-of-sight connection to a receiver. They are now largely used for point-to-point microwave connections.
The FCC said it will study what technologies could help get around the technological and practical obstacles and what kind of regulatory regime could help a variety of technologies to flourish on those airwaves, including the potential for services other than mobile.
The U.S. wireless industry continues to work on deploying the 4G connections, though some equipment manufacturers, such as Samsung are already testing data transmission on the higher frequencies.
"While we will always work to locate more cleared licensed spectrum under 3 GHz, we also need to expand our search to find other complementary spectrum bands, and this Notice is an important step in that effort," Meredith Attwell Baker, head of CTIA-The Wireless Association, said in a statement.
Google on Monday asked the FCC for permission to conduct tests on some of the extremely high-frequency airwaves, which experts say may provide the foundation for a wireless version of its high-speed fiber Internet service.
Rosenworcel said growing data demand made it necessary for next-generation wireless networks to carry heavy traffic, quickly and without draining the phones' batteries. "How do we meet these demands? We look up. Way, way, up. To infinity and beyond," she said at the meeting. (Reporting by Alina Selyukh and Marina Lopes; editing by Andrew Hay)

First Impressions of the iPad Air 2: Refreshed but Not Reinvented; It¡¦s Thinner, Lighter and Has Improvements That Matter

Meet the new iPad Air: It looks very similar to the old one. Is that OK?
We¡¦ve come to expect every Apple Inc. product refresh will be thinner, lighter and have a better camera¡Xand the iPad Air 2 that Apple unveiled on Thursday checks all those boxes. It also now includes the iPhone¡¦s Touch ID sensor, which replaces passwords with your thumbprint.
But anyone looking for stop-the-presses new capabilities in the new iPad may be disappointed. Tablet sales growth across the market has slowed as consumers hang on to older models that still work OK and shift toward larger ¡§phablet¡¨-style phones or hybrid laptop-tablets with keyboards.
There¡¦s talk that tablets, just four years old, are having an identity crisis.
That¡¦s premature. I got to spend a little time with the iPad Air 2 after Apple¡¦s event on Thursday. My first impression is that Apple wants to make the statement that iPads are something unique¡Xnot all-in-one computers or laptop replacements. They¡¦re a kind of computer you can hold in your hands that immerses you in watching video, reading books, browsing the Web, playing games, and completing tasks that are best done with fingers on a touch screen.
And for those tasks, Apple didn¡¦t need to reinvent the tablet but improve on it. I think they¡¦ve done that¡Xbut there could be more, particularly where business people and younger users are concerned.
First, the new iPad Air is 18% thinner than its already stick-thin predecessor. You can feel that when you hold it with one hand along the bottom. It¡¦s lighter, too, though that was harder to notice when I compared old and new iPads, one in each hand.
The thinner form has another advantage¡Xone that may be my favorite feature: It allowed Apple to cut down on glare by about 50%. (Apple says slimming the number of different components in the screen from three to one reduces the gaps between layers that reflect light, producing glare.) I could see that clearly holding the older Air and Air 2 side by side.
When I caught the reflection of an overhead light, text on the old model became unreadable but remained clear on the new one. The big test will be direct sunlight, which I didn¡¦t get a chance to try on Thursday.
I¡¦m also glad to see that Apple included the Touch ID sensor found on recent models of the iPhone. That will make unlocking the screen and making online purchases easier on a device that¡¦s great for leaning back and shopping. While it supports the new Apple Pay for making online payments, you won¡¦t be able to use it to pay in physical stores.
The iPad Air 2 also got a camera upgrade, though I¡¦ll hold off on judgment until I¡¦ve been able to test it in lowlight situations, where many phone and tablet cameras struggle.
But there are improvements I¡¦m still waiting to see that would extend the iPad¡¦s usefulness without turning it into an inferior laptop. I had been hoping that the new iPad might support app multitasking like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S and Windows 8, which let you split your screen between, say, Twitter and a Web browser.
While I often use a Bluetooth keyboard when working on my iPad, I¡¦m surprised Apple hasn¡¦t embraced the keyboard case like its competitors. There are times when you just want to type and don¡¦t want to strain on a glass keyboard or pull out a laptop.
And any parent can tell you that iPads are great ways to entertain¡Xand even teach¡Xlittle ones. But there needs to be a way to corral all of the kid-friendly material in one place and leave Junior to it. Just saying ixnay to browsers and cameras isn¡¦t the answer.
For many people, the question is whether the new capabilities in the iPad Air 2 warrant an upgrade. With a new form factor and better screen, the iPad Air 2 is a bigger leap than we saw between the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. If you¡¦re buying something you want to last for years ahead, it¡¦s a great choice. But it also isn¡¦t a whole new kind of tablet¡Xand last year¡¦s models just got $100 cheaper.

TSMC Remains Upbeat After Latest Jump in Profit

TAIPEI -- After Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. logged its most profitable quarter, executives remain upbeat about how Apple Inc. and other mobile-device makers will propel its revenue even higher in coming years.
TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker by revenue, said Thursday that net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled 76.34 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$2.51 billion). It was up 47% from NT$51.95 billion a year earlier, beating the company's previous record of NT$59.7 billion in the second quarter and exceeding analysts' estimates. Revenue rose 29% from a year earlier to NT$209.05 billion, also a record.
Although the explosive growth of global smartphone and tablet sales has waned, TSMC's increasing market share because of technological advances has helped the company boost its earnings at rates stronger than most chip makers.
Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho predicted revenue in the current quarter of between NT$217 billion and NT$220 billion -- as much as 5% higher than the previous quarter and possibly another record. It is largely in line with analysts' estimates.
"If we take away the contribution from 20-nanometer [a process technology adopted by the facility that produces microprocessors for iPhones], the fourth-quarter revenue will probably be down by [a rate] close to double digits," Mark Liu, one of the company's two chief executives, said during an investor conference in Taipei Thursday.
Revenue from the 20-nanometer facility will rise to 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, from 9% in the third quarter, the company said.
Last year, the Taiwan-based chip maker was among the first to migrate to the 20-nanometer chip-process technology from the less advanced 28-nanometer process. The transition allowed it to produce more powerful chips than most rivals at lower costs, and helped it beat out Samsung Electronics Co. for the order from the iPhone maker. TSMC started shipping chips to Apple in late June.
This lead lifted not only TSMC's revenue. The boost from Apple is also apparent among many Taiwanese companies that churn out components for the Cupertino, Calif., company. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., commonly known as Foxconn, and Largan Precision Co. have also reported strong earnings because of business from Apple.
Besides Apple, TSMC also makes microprocessors for hundreds of other clients including Qualcomm Inc. More than half of TSMC's third-quarter revenue came from producing chips for smartphones and tablets.
At the same conference, TSMC's other chief executive, C.C. Wei, said the company expects to start mass-producing with the next-generation 16-nanometer process technology by the end of the second quarter of next year. It will be about one quarter earlier than the company's previous forecast, but will still be months behind Intel Corp. and Samsung.
"Right now, more than 1,000 engineers are working on that. Our experience in the 20-nanometer process helps us ramp up the 16-nanometer much faster than we expected," Mr. Wei said, adding that revenue from this process technology will kick in during the fourth quarter of 2015.
In a bid to regain the lead in technological advances, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said in a recent interview that the company has committed a "blank check" to developing the finer 10-nanometer process technology "in the shortest time possible." The Taiwanese company plans to deliver a prototype 10-nanometer chip based on ARM Holdings PLC's design in the fourth quarter of next year.
Ms. Ho said the company plans to spend more than US$10 billion next year to develop and build advanced facilities. The company has earmarked US$9.6 billion as capital expenditures for this year.
Capacity will grow 12% this year, higher than the company's previous target, Ms. Ho said. Capacity expansion will likely be at a similar rate next year, she added.
A surprise earnings warning last week from Microchip Technology Inc. has recently clouded the outlook for the semiconductor sector.
While many chip makers don't share the pessimism of the Arizona maker of computer chips, analysts say weaker-than-expected demand for electronics remains a possibility amid the uneven economic growth of China and the U.S.
"Demand from our customers doesn't validate the comment from Microchip," said Mr. Liu. "Demand from China is still normal, maybe a little deviation from seasonal [levels], but demand for fourth-generation [mobile application] and telecom infrastructure remains aggressive."

Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Review: The Phablet Pioneer Still Leads the Way; The Pocketable Device Has Serious Multitasking Power, but Can It Beat the iPhone 6 Plus?

I was convinced Samsung was off its rocker when I saw the first Galaxy Note phablet in 2011.
While most smartphone makers were expanding phones to comfortably fit in a human hand, Samsung decided to release one closer in size to a Times Square billboard. And what better way to navigate that vast screen than with a stylus the size of a toothpick?
Of course, I was the crazy one. People started buying Samsung¡¦s kooky, oversized creation¡Xa lot of them. Other companies stopped laughing and started making their own. Now, almost exactly three years later, even Apple has bowed to the pressure, releasing an iPhone with a phablet-class 5.5-inch screen.
Samsung doesn¡¦t plan to lag behind those who have followed in its Sasquatchian footsteps, especially not its fiercest rival in Cupertino, Calif. The Galaxy Note 4, which hits Verizon, AT&T and Sprint stores this week for $300 with two-year contract, has a higher-resolution 2560x1440-pixel, 5.7-inch display and much improved hardware design. It also has new software tricks that take better advantage of the roomy screen space than the competition.
It¡¦s wrong to call the Note an oversized smartphone at this point. It¡¦s a pocketable computing device with serious multitasking power. But while Samsung is further ahead on big-screen software features than any competitor, the other half of the software story isn¡¦t as rosy. The Note 4 still lacks that all-important mobile essential: an intuitive, cleanly designed user interface.
Better Hardware, Brilliant Display
My years of cringing at the Galaxy Note¡¦s design are over.
No more shiny backing that shows my slimy fingerprints, no more kid-toy plastic with faux leather stitching. Instead, an aluminum frame surrounds the Note 4, making it feel like a well-made device. The fakeness of the latest synthetic-leather back is justified by being incredibly smooth and soft¡Xand easier to grip than an iPhone 6 Plus.
The design is far from perfect. The chamfered edges of the phone can be sharp, (I prefer the curves of the iPhone 6 Plus and the new Moto X), the bezel¡¦s subtle lines don¡¦t match the rest of the aesthetic and, unlike the Galaxy S5, the Note 4 isn¡¦t rugged or waterproof.
Don¡¦t get me wrong, Samsung has done what I thought was impossible: created a phone that looks and feels good.
Like the iPhone 6 Plus, the Note 4 outlasts smaller-screen phones because it houses a larger battery. After a 14-hour day of heavy use, including navigation and snapping lots of photos, I hit the 5% battery mark¡Xand kept going until bedtime using the ¡§ultra power-saving mode.¡¨ By disabling lots of services and turning everything you see black and white, it can squeeze 24 more hours out of a Note 4 using only 10% of the battery, says Samsung.
In a challenge to see who would drop first, I cranked the brightness up on both the Galaxy Note and the iPhone 6 Plus and streamed video. They both lasted 8? hours.
Remember Ellen DeGeneres¡¦s Oscar selfie seen ¡¦round the world? She and Bradley Cooper, who snapped the shot, used last year¡¦s Note, and they¡¦d probably be more impressed with the improved 3.7-megapixel front-facing camera and its new selfie tricks.
Not only would all those celebrity faces now look crisper, but Brad would¡¦ve had an easier time just tapping the heart-rate sensor on the rear of the phone to enable the shutter. Jared Leto¡¦s face may not have been chopped off if the wide selfie mode was enabled. Though if not done carefully, the feature can incorrectly stitch photos and render faces grotesquely distorted.
The 16-megapixel rear camera also does selfies, using facial recognition or voice command to capture your mug. The less self-absorbed will be more impressed with the quality of its vibrant, well-balanced shots, and how well digitally zoomed-in shots now look.
Like on the iPhone 6 Plus, optical image stabilization helped capture sharper nighttime and moving shots. However, I found the iPhone 6 Plus¡¦ faster shutter and auto focus combined with better low-light shots, gave it a slight edge in the camera department.
Here¡¦s the twist: The iPhone 6 Plus may take better photos, but photos (and everything else) appear sharper and more vibrant on the Note¡¦s gorgeous display. That¡¦s because Samsung¡¦s Super AMOLED screen has about 1.5 million more pixels than the iPhone 6 Plus¡¦s 5.5-inch 1920x1080-pixel display. Text looks crisper and blues, greens and reds are more vivid, though not necessarily as natural.
Powerful Software Just Shy of Phabulous
With software features that take advantage of all that screen real estate, Samsung shows it¡¦s got more phablet smarts than Apple and others. The result is a more productive device, much closer to that of a tablet or laptop.
Like on previous Notes, you can put two apps side by side or on top of each other, but now you can drag text between the windows. Only some apps support the feature, but I was able to highlight a portion of a colleague¡¦s article in the browser and drag it into an email.
You can turn the main Android home screen into a pseudo computer desktop with a feature that lets you pop out small windowed versions of select apps. You aren¡¦t going to want a mini email app open all day, but it¡¦s helpful for at-a-glance information. On a recent trip, I put up a tiny Google map showing my destination.
I still can¡¦t get excited about the S Pen stylus, despite the fact it¡¦s more precise and pressure sensitive than before. I generally use the styli I was born with to navigate the screen because they¡¦re always on, and I can type faster with my fingers than I can write with a pen. However, new tricks, such as leaving yourself ¡§action memos¡¨ on the home screen, or highlighting multiple photos by dragging the pen across them, will appeal to people who prefer writing and drawing.
The disappointment is that the Note 4¡¦s tricks are masked by a user experience I can only describe as ugly. The neon green and teal, those bright, tacky icons¡Xit all makes the phone hard to look at. And that¡¦s before wading through the third-party apps and promotional widgets that Samsung loves to pre-load. Despite the phone¡¦s quad-core processor, I experienced sporadic slowdowns, stuttering in apps and too many of the dreaded ¡§This app has stopped¡¨ messages. I blame the bloatware.
I wish Samsung wasn¡¦t bucking the current trend of Android phone makers striving for more polished, uncluttered design. The new Moto X uses a clean beautiful version of Android, and Google¡¦s new Nexus 6, also built by Motorola, will have the next version of Android¡Xand an even bigger screen than the Note 4. Meanwhile, iOS continues to be as polished as it comes.
Yet no other phone maker can deliver such a clear vision of why the future will be written on these smartphone-tablet hybrids. It may not meet my high aesthetic standards, software-wise, but multitasking on that big, beautiful display makes the Note feel more productive and powerful than any other phablet out there. Even the iPhone 6 Plus. This is the best phone I have seen from Samsung in a long time¡Xmaybe ever.

SINGAPORE, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Asia's front-month first-half December naphtha crack fell 14
percent to $64.35 a tonne on Thursday weighed down by stock piles. 
    Spot prices of cargoes going into North Asia sold at steep discounts while naphtha streaming
out of the India was sold at levels not seen in more than five years despite demand from
petrochemical makers. 
    Japan's Mitsui Chemicals joined others including South Korea's Lotte Chemical, S-Oil Corp,
Samsung Total and Taiwan's Formosa to purchase second-half November cargoes this week. It paid
discounts of $12 to $13 per tonne to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis. 
    JG Summit of the Philippines was also looking to buy a November cargo. 
    "Demand is still there but supplies have increased," said a trader, adding that cargoes
coming to Asia from Europe and the Mediterranean have outpaced demand. 
    India's Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) on the other hand sold a naphtha
cargo to Mercuria for Nov. 22-24 loading from New Mangalore at about $1 a tonne above Middle
East quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis. 
    A few months back, MRPL was still selling some of its April, May and June spot cargoes at
premiums in the $40s a tonne level, Reuters data showed. 
    
    OTHER TENDERS: Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) sold two naphtha cargoes for November loading
with traders saying that the cargoes could have been bought by Shell and Trafigura. 
    But this could not be confirmed as the parties do not comment on their deals. 
    GASOLINE CRACK AT A WEEK'S HIGH
    The Asian gasoline crack rose to reach a week's high of $11.18 a barrel on firm Indonesian
demand as Asia's top importer has yet to restart some of its refinery units following planned
maintenance which started in September. 
    Pertamina has started maintenance at some of the units in its Cilacap and Balikpapan
refineries last month. 
    The Singapore onshore stocks also pointed to a drawdown as  weekly inventories fell 7.3
percent to reach a two-week low of 11.229 million barrels in the week to Oct. 15, official data
showed. 
    
    SINGAPORE CASH DEALS: One naphtha deal and one on gasoline. 
    Shell sold a 92-octane gasoline cargo for Nov. 5-9 loading at $94.20 a barrel. 
    Shell also sold a naphtha cargo for second-half December delivery to Socar at $691 a tonne.

WSJ.D Technology: Pricey Google Devices Target Apple Buyers --- Bigger Nexus Smartphone, Tablet, TV Set-Top Box Arriving Next Month

Google Inc. unveiled three Nexus-branded devices on Wednesday, signaling plans to compete with Apple Inc. for high-end consumers.
Google's new Nexus 6 smartphone, Nexus 9 tablet and Nexus Player set-top box are priced slightly below, or in line with, competing devices from Apple. In the past, Google has priced new models significantly below Apple products.That is a departure for Google, which in the past has priced new models significantly below Apple products.
Google also said it would introduce a new version of its Android operating system, dubbed Android L, for Lollipop, next month.
Unlike Apple, Google licenses its operating system to other phone makers. With the new releases, Google aims to compete more with Apple at the premium end of the mobile-device market and help partners churn out cheap handsets for developing markets.
"We deeply respect what Apple is doing, but we take a very different approach," said Sundar Pichai, who runs Google's Android, Chrome and Apps businesses. "With Android L, we wanted to show the entire spectrum."
Android powered 85% of smartphones shipped globally in the second quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. But in developed markets, such as the U.S., Apple devices remain popular with more affluent customers. That gives Apple an advantage because its users spend more on applications, encouraging developers to work on its platform first.
Google's three new devices can be preordered online later this week. The phone will be sold in 27 countries and will be in stores in November.
At 5.9 inches diagonally, the Nexus 6 is larger than Apple's new iPhone 6 Plus, which measures 5.5 inches. It will sell for $649, compared with $749 for the iPhone 6 Plus. Last year, Google introduced the Nexus 5 at $349.
Mr. Pichai said the goal of Nexus products isn't to sell lots of devices, but to provide a "road map" to help other Android device makers, such as Samsung Electronics Co., develop similar products.
The Nexus 6 will be available through the four major U.S. wireless carriers and sold in their stores, with two-year contracts and monthly installment plans that reduce the upfront cost of the device, Mr. Pichai said. Verizon Communications Inc. didn't carry the two most recent Nexus phones.
The Nexus 6 smartphone is made by Motorola Mobility, the handset manufacturer that Google is selling to China's Lenovo Group.
The Nexus 9 tablet, made by HTC Corp., features an 8.9-inch screen and starts at $399. An optional keyboard cover costs $129. It will be available in 30 countries and in stores next month. Google hopes the Nexus 9 can substitute for laptops in some work situations. Microsoft Corp. has tried that strategy with its Surface tablet, but it has failed to catch on with lots of consumers.Mr. Pichai said many people already use Android tablets, which should help get the Nexus 9 adopted in the office and on business trips.
The Nexus 9's $399 starting price is also close to what Apple charges for its iPads. The 9.7-inch tablets from Apple start at $399 and the latest iPad Air tablet starts $499. Apple is expected to unveil new iPads Thursday.
The Nexus Player is a small set-top box shaped like a hockey puck that connects to TVs and uses Wi-Fi to stream movies and TV shows. It doubles as a gaming console, letting users play Android games on a larger screen. Asustek Computer Inc. made the gadget.
The set-top box costs $99 and will be sold in the U.S. and Canada through Google's Play store in early November. That matches Apple's $99 set-top box, Apple TV. The Nexus Player has an optional game controller that costs $39.99.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Qualcomm signals $2.5 bln belief in Bluetooth

LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Qualcomm's 1.6 billion pound ($2.5 billion) deal to buy Britain's CSR sends a positive signal to rivals on Bluetooth. The U.S. chipmaker's $120 billion market cap means the purchase isn't a stretch - but it comes at a high price and an odd time.
Qualcomm's 900 pence-a-share offer represents a toppy 57 percent premium to where CSR shares were trading in late August before another suitor, Qualcomm's smaller rival Microchip Technology, first emerged. That desire to see off a competitor presumably helps explain the big sweetener.
The bid also looks rich in multiple terms. The price is 27 times 2015 forecast earnings, based on Starmine data which weights analysts' estimates based on their track record. Rivals trade on a maximum of 20 times forward 12-month earnings - although trading multiples do not include the control premium paid in a takeover.
Nor is there probably much scope for synergies, since Qualcomm focuses on kit used in smartphones and other Wi-Fi devices. CSR, by contrast, sold its handset business to Samsung in 2012.
Moreover, this comes just five days after Microchip warned the industry was facing a cyclical correction. Solid quarterly numbers from sector heavyweight Intel, on Oct. 14, were less gloomy. But Microchip has proved a good bellwether before.
For Qualcomm, though, this is a long-term bet on the rise of the "Internet of Things." CSR's specialty is Bluetooth, the short-range radio technology that connects devices like watches and stereos to internet-linked computers and smartphones.
As demand growth for smartphones slows, Qualcomm hopes this will be offset by consumers buying networked appliances. Industry analysts Gartner reckon the typical family home in the rich world will contain more than 500 internet-enabled consumer products within eight years.
If so, this could look smart. But exponential growth is easy to predict. It doesn't always arrive as planned. And even if it does, it doesn't always deliver outsized profits for the suppliers. 
              
              
              
              
CONTEXT NEWS
              
- U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm agreed on Oct. 15 to buy Britain's CSR for 1.56 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), to grow in markets including automotive and audio products.
- Qualcomm's bid was made hours before a so-called "put up or shut up" deadline triggered by rival bid interest from Microchip Technology, which approached CSR in August.
- Qualcomm said it would pay 900 pence a share in cash for CSR, a 57 percent premium to the closing price on Aug. 26, the day before the offer period started. By 1335 BST on Oct. 15, CSR shares had risen 30 percent to 858 pence.
- Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven Mollenkopf said CSR's Bluetooth expertise would help his company sell microchips for portable audio, automotive and wearable devices. "Combining CSR's highly advanced offering of connectivity technologies... will unlock new opportunities for growth," he said in a statement.

Lenovo to Establish New Mobile Phone Company in China; Smartphone Company With Different Brand Name Is Part of Efforts to Fend Off Competition in China

Personal-computer and smartphone maker Lenovo Group Ltd. said it would create a new company in China next year that focuses on selling mobile phones online.
The new smartphone company, which will have a different brand name, is part of Lenovo¡¦s efforts to fend off fierce competition in China from Xiaomi Inc., a local smartphone startup that sells its handsets online while cultivating its fan base through its own software, services and entertainment offerings. Xiaomi is also known for being marketing savvy, engaging with consumers through online forums and social networks.
Lenovo said in a statement Wednesday that it will continue to sell Lenovo-branded phones in China through local carriers and retailers.
The new smartphone company, which will start its operation April 1, 2015, won't only sell devices online but will also offer applications and focus on consumer engagement, Lenovo said.
Lenovo, which last year overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. as the world¡¦s largest PC maker, has been quickly expanding its smartphone business for the past year. In the second quarter, Lenovo was the world¡¦s fourth-largest smartphone maker by shipments behind Samsung, Apple and Huawei Technologies Co., according to IDC.
Lenovo and Xiaomi are two of the biggest smartphone makers in China, both selling more phones in the market than Samsung Electronics Co. or Apple Inc.
In recent quarters, Lenovo and Xiaomi have been competing intensely against each other for the number-one position by shipments.
Lenovo¡¦s plans to set up a new mobile phone business comes as the company is in the process of completing a $2.91 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in the U.S.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Twitter, Tesla deserve salute for patent war truce

NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Twitter and Tesla deserve a crisp salute for helping to cool the patent wars. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions clearly contributed to a 40 percent drop in the number of infringement suits. But the microblogging site and Elon Musk's electric carmaker eased pressures to sue with efforts to share technology - and goose future demand.
Some 330 patent complaints landed in federal courts in September, compared with around 550 a year earlier, according to litigation analysis firm Lex Machina. The numbers have dropped steadily since reaching an April high.
A big reason is probably a Supreme Court decision in June that said merely running abstract ideas through a computer doesn't make them patentable. Since then, lower courts have declared patents invalid in at least a dozen cases. The ruling has also cast doubt on protections for certain types of software.
Two other top-court cases discouraged weak infringement lawsuits by giving their targets more leeway to recoup legal fees. The Patent and Trademark Office's appeal board has been using new powers to review and nullify dodgy patents that have already been granted.
More companies may be realizing, though, that costly enforcement actions aren't worth it. Twitter announced two years ago that it would allow engineers to veto litigation involving intellectual property they developed. Tesla opened up its technology to other users in June, just before the Supreme Court decision.
The upside for Twitter was the possibility of attracting more customers and top-notch engineers. Its lack of a big patent arsenal, of course, meant the risk was low. Musk's company reckons sharing IP will speed development of batteries, charging stations and other technology integral to the industry's success - and, therefore, its own.
History suggests they're on to something. The early technology behind personal computers, wireless communications and even textile manufacturing was left open for rivals to copy and develop. The tactic encouraged innovation and the creation of complementary products that helped expand demand.
Other companies may be coming around. Samsung is to share patents with Google over the next decade and has ended its legal battles with Apple outside the United States. After years of vicious fighting, the lure of a peace dividend can be tough to resist. 
              
              
              
              
CONTEXT NEWS
              
- The number of U.S. patent lawsuits filed in September dropped 40 percent from the total a year before, from 549 to 329, according to litigation analysis firm Lex Machina. Filings in each of the past five months have also decreased significantly since reaching a high of 675 in April, the company reported.
- The U.S. Supreme Court on June 19 decided that abstract ideas cannot be patented merely because they are implemented through a computer. The court's nine justices ruled unanimously in favor of CLS Bank International, which had challenged Australian derivatives market operator Alice Corp's patents for a computer system that keeps track of financial transactions.

GameStop¡¦s Holiday Pitch: More Layaway, Generous Financing; Electronics Retailer to Offer Expanded Layaway Offerings, Including Game Consoles

GameStop Corp. on Wednesday continued its push for holiday shoppers by unveiling expanded layaway offerings, including next-generation videogame consoles and tablets, along with more generous financing terms for holders of its store credit cards.
The latest moves come as the videogame and electronics retailer has been posting strong results buoyed by demand for new consoles from Sony, Microsoft Corp. and Nintendo.
For the holidays, the company is preparing to see high demand for new games for the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One and the Wii U, as well as from customers who are looking to trade in their old smartphones for cash to help buy the new Apple Inc. iPhone 6. GameStop refurbishes and sells used iPhones and other pre-owned electronics as it looks to become a bigger player in an industry that the company expects will grow by 20% to 25% annually over the next five years.
Last month, to prepare for the rush, GameStop said it would hire 25,000 seasonal workers this year, a 47% jump from last year.
In another change from last year, when the Microsoft and Sony consoles debuted, the retailer has made the PlayStation 4 available for layaway during the upcoming holiday season. It had previously made the console available for layaway in April.
The Xbox One, which was available for layaway in February, wasn¡¦t on the list of products the company announced Wednesday. However, a company representative confirmed that the device will become available for layaway in early November.
Two Samsung Galaxy 4 tablets will be available under the program, too, the company said, as will a variety of headsets and accessories that hadn¡¦t been available before. The company added that it will make more products available as the season progresses and items become available.
GameStop also said it is also offering a limited-time financing offer for holders of its PowerUP Rewards Pro credit card. Under the incentive, customers will be eligible to pay nothing in interest on purchases of $500 or more for six months, GameStop said.
Retailers have reinvigorated layaway programs in recent years as cost-conscious consumers trim back credit-card spending amid a slow economic recovery. Sears Holdings Corp.¡¦s Kmart chain recently triggered the beginning of its layaway season, as well.

Asia Naphtha/Gasoline-Naphtha crack dips despite emerging demand

SINGAPORE, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Asian naphtha crack
slipped $1.75 to $74.90 a tonne on Wednesday, 24 percent lower
than a year ago, as the supply overhang persisted despite demand
emerging this week.
    South Korea's Lotte Chemical joined a string of buyers to
buy second-half November naphtha.  
    Some traders said the petrochemical maker paid a discount of
$14 a tonne to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis,
which marked a fresh low for 2014 in South Korea.
    "This is a desperate situation," said a North Asian trader
referring to the high supplies. 
    But some traders were not convinced that any trader would 
sell at such a deep discount, saying a discount of $11 would
have been more reasonable.  
    Lotte Chemical's purchase came a day after Asia's top
naphtha buyer Formosa bought slightly over 100,000 tonnes of
open-spec naphtha for second-half November delivery at a
discount of $14 a tonne. 
    Earlier in the week, there was a private deal done in Japan
but details were not known. 
    Samsung Total and S-Oil Corp has each bought naphtha for
second-half November delivery, with the latter paying $8 to $9 a
tonne below Japan quotes for up to 20,000 tonnes of heavy
full-range naphtha. 
    S-Oil on the other hand sold a total of 66,000 tonnes of
light naphtha to Japanese traders Marubeni and Petro-Diamond at
record low discounts of $19 to $20 a tonne to Japan quotes on a
free-on-board (FOB) basis. 
    
    OTHER NEWS: S-Oil will complete a 40,000-tonne naphtha
storage tank at Onsan by late November, helping it to buy more
to take advantage of low heavy full-range naphtha prices,
industry sources said on Wednesday. 
    
    NAPHTHA CASH DEALS: Itochu bought from Socar a first-half
December naphtha cargo at $709 a tonne. 
       
    GASOLINE CRACK FIRMS
    The Asian gasoline crack rose to a four-session high of
nearly $10 a barrel on vibrant trades in the Singapore cash
market.     
    Not only did the cash deals resume after a short absence but
the 200,000 barrels traded were the highest in about a month. 
    PTT sold three of the four 92-octane gasoline cargoes in the
cash market. 
    It sold two cargoes for Nov. 10-Nov. 14 loading, one to
Vitol at $93 a barrel and another to Phillips 66 at $93.50 a
barrel. It went on to sell to BP a Nov. 4-Nov. 8 cargo at $94.60
a barrel.
    Shell on the other hand sold a 92-octane gasoline cargo to
PetroChina for Nov. 4-Nov. 8 at $94.60 a barrel.

* Chip tool maker maintains full-year guidance
* Timing of demand for next-generation systems unclear
* Fourth quarter guidance should offset weaker third quarter (Adds analyst comment, updates share price)
By Thomas Escritt
AMSTERDAM, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML blamed delayed shipments as it brushed off weaker-than-expected quarterly sales on Wednesday, confirming its full-year target and forecasting a strong start to 2015.
Analysts have expressed concern over uncertain demand for next-generation systems, but investors were cheered by ASML's robust order book and a positive outlook from major customer Intel on Tuesday, lifting the stock in early trade.
Sales figures from ASML - which supplies chip lithography systems to all of the world's largest chip makers, including Intel, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing - serve as a leading indicator of the investment plans for the industry as a whole.
"Looking ahead, we see a solid start to 2015," ASML Chief Executive Peter Wennink said, adding a "strong backlog" would mean higher sales of systems for making computer memory chips.
Sales of next-generation logic systems, however, depended on demand further down the chain: "The timing and volume depends on the business allocations by our customers' customers."
The company posted net sales of 1.32 billion euros ($1.67 billion) for the three months to end-September, slightly below the 1.4 billion it had forecast in the previous quarter and virtually flat on the same period last year.
The company said sales were just shy of forecasts and analyst expectations because of "a couple of system shipments shifting into Q4". It said that would not affect the full-year forecast for net sales of at least 5.6 billion euros, up from 5.25 billion in 2013.
"We believe the miss in the third quarter will be more than compensated for in the fourth quarter. We expect to see (2014 earnings per share) upgrades of 2 percent on the back of the results," said ING analyst Robin van den Broek, who has a "buy" rating on the stock.
"The order book ... shows strong momentum."
Uncertainty over the future still weighed on ASML shares, however, trading down 0.8 percent at 0900 GMT at 73.23 euros, having pared earlier gains.
"The third quarter was of course a bit disappointing, but with some systems being shifted into the fourth quarter that's not a major issue, with the reiteration of the full year guidance," said Rabobank analyst Philip Scholte.
NEXT GENERATION
ASML's third-quarter gross margin dipped by two percentage points on the previous quarter to 43.7 percent and the company predicted a fourth-quarter margin of 43 percent, down from 43.6 percent in the same quarter last year.
The company said average selling prices for its photolithography systems fell to 29.5 million euros in the third quarter from 40.1 million euros in the second quarter, as customers continued to upgrade existing systems rather than increase spending on new ones.
Half of the company's total sales were of older 28-nanometre scale products to Asian foundries, which act as contract manufacturers for chip designers with no production capacity of their own.
Customers were still looking to add capacity in the high end 14, 16 and 20-nanometre segments, but the timing remained unclear, Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Nickl said.
The company has been investing heavily in next-generation extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography systems, and two customers recently passed the crucial 500 chip wafers per day volume milestone using these devices.
Nickl said the company expected to ship six EUV systems in 2015.
On Tuesday Intel Corp, the world's largest chip maker, defied recent gloom among chip investors in giving an end-of-year forecast above expectations. It also said its supply chain was in good shape ahead of the holiday season as demand for personal computers recovered.

Jai Mani, who joins as lead product manager, was strategy and analytics associate for Google Play and co-founded a startup, according to his LinkedIn profile, before relocating from San Francisco.
"You can think of it as the beginning of our R&D center development in India," Hugo Barra, vice president for global operations at Xiaomi, said.
"The first person we hired is someone who's going to be the glue between our users in India, product feedback that we receive, and the engineering team we have in Beijing as well as the engineering team that we are going to be building fairly soon in India," he said.
Mr. Barra, who also joined Xiaomi from Google, said he and Mr. Mani "worked very closely at Google."
The appointment comes as Xiaomi is expanding outside of China and ramping up its presence in India and Southeast Asia. The Chinese company wants to build products or applications that run on its cellphones aimed at a global audience from India, Mr. Barra told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. Xiaomi, which means "little rice" in Chinese, has intensified competition in a smartphone market dominated by Apple and Samsung. Xiaomi has created buzz in China and India by selling high-end phones online directly to consumers for prices that are close to cost. The company offers services such as mobile applications and movies via its software and makes money by selling an array of accessories. Mr. Mani worked with Google from 2009 until 2013.

SEOUL, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Cheil Industries Inc, widely seen as the de facto holding company of Samsung Group, is likely to offer around 1.5 trillion won ($1.41 billion) worth of shares in its upcoming initial public offering (IPO), a person with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
Cheil may sell the shares at a price ranging from 45,000 won to 55,000 won each, according to a preliminary plan submitted by the company to South Korea's stock exchange, said the person, who declined to be identified as the listing process is so far private.
After a stock split approved by Cheil shareholders in August, such an offer range would give Cheil a market capitalization of 6 trillion to 7 trillion won.
Cheil is likely to offer around 20 to 25 percent of its total shares, including new issuance and shares currently held by existing shareholders, the Korea Economic Daily reported earlier on Wednesday without saying where it obtained the information.
Cheil, which changed its name from Samsung Everland Inc in July, is likely to list as early as December after announcing IPO plans earlier this year.
A Cheil spokesman declined comment.

UPDATE 2-Apple supplier Skyworks' profit jumps as RF chip demand rises

(Adds details, analyst and executive comments, background; updates shares)
By Abhirup Roy
Oct 14 (Reuters) - Skyworks Solutions Inc, a supplier of radio frequency chips to companies such as Apple Inc , estimated fourth-quarter adjusted profit and revenue above its forecast, sending its shares up as much as 12.5 percent.
Skyworks, whose chips connect smartphones and tablets to a telecom network, has been benefiting from higher demand from handset makers, particularly Apple.
Apple sold 10 million of its latest iPhones in the first weekend after its new, larger phone models went on sale in 10 countries on Sept. 19. The new devices will be available in more than 115 countries by the end of the year.
"You have got a combination of good units and apparently good sell-through for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and ... you also have a content increase story there," Oppenheimer & Co analyst Rick Schafer told Reuters.
The market for RF chips is expanding as telecom operators upgrade to 4G networks from 3G. 4G-equipped smartphones require more RF chips than 3G-equipped ones.
"What we say for Skyworks is that they are in the early stages of what we call an RF boom cycle," Schafer said.
He said that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus contained 20-25 percent more Skyworks' components than did the iPhone 5S.
Skyworks, whose clients include Samsung Electronics , estimated an adjusted profit of $1.08 per share and revenue of $718 million for the quarter ended September - it had earlier forecast earnings of $1 per share and revenue of $680 million.
The company had reported an adjusted profit of 64 cents per share and revenue of $477 million, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a fourth-quarter profit of $1.01 per share and revenue of $679.4 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Skyworks' upbeat estimates come at a time when investors are concerned about a broad-based downturn in the semiconductor industry due to lower demand for electronic devices.
A number of U.S. chipmakers have in recent weeks suggested demand for chips from various industries, including automobiles and network equipment, was falling across regions, particularly Asia and Europe.
Skyworks is also benefiting from the growth in Internet-connected devices - commonly called the "Internet of Things" - which allows machines on wired and wireless networks to interact.
"These multi-year technology trends are setting the stage for us to outperform the broader semiconductor industry in the December quarter and for the foreseeable future," Chief Executive David Aldrich said in a statement on Tuesday.
Skyworks is expected to report its fourth-quarter results on Nov. 6.
The company's shares were up 10.4 percent at $50.05 in noon trading on the Nasdaq. Shares of other RF chip suppliers to Apple such as RF Micro Devices Inc, NXP Semiconductors NV and Avago Technologies Ltd also rose.

By Jessica Jaganathan and Seng Li Peng
SINGAPORE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - North Asian refineries are slashing spot prices of most oil products to multi-year lows to get rid of high inventory as they battle weak regional demand and competition from a booming U.S. shale market, industry sources said.
Some might also consider run cuts if oil product margins continue to slide and supplies remain ample.
The Asian gasoil margin has averaged about $14 a barrel above Dubai crude so far in October, compared with about $17 in the same period last year, Reuters data showed.
Weak demand from the industrial sector due to slowing economies in big consuming countries such as China is putting downward pressure on gasoil prices even though the fourth quarter sees peak demand for the fuel used for heating.
The Asian naphtha crack hit a 26-month low of $62.63 a tonne on Oct. 10, before recovering slightly to $63.95 on Monday, partly due to the U.S. shale boom and the flow of east-bound cargoes from Europe and the Mediterranean.
KEEP RUN RATES
Most North Asian refineries are maintaining run rates at above 80 percent as they are forced to meet term commitments, while some are taking advantage of cheaper feedstock such as crude oil, driving up inventory and lowering prices of oil products, traders said.
Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemicals Corp, for instance, sold an October-loading gasoil cargo at a record low cash discount as its refinery is running at 95 percent of capacity, traders said.
"We don't have any plans to reduce run rates yet as we have already prepared the feedstock and the price of feedstock is declining, but with margins also declining, it might be hard to sustain such high operating rates," a Formosa spokesman said.
The company might cut run rates in November if margins continue to deteriorate, although no decision has been taken yet, he added.
Brent crude fell on Monday to its lowest level since December 2010 because of rising supply and a weakening global economic outlook.
South Korean refiners are selling their diesel cargoes for about 30 percent lower than a month ago.
S-Oil Corp has sold a naphtha cargo for October loading at a discount of $12 a tonne to Japan quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis and SK Energy has sold a November-loading naphtha cargo at a discount of $15 a tonne, multi-year lows.
This contrasts sharply with the $53 a tonne premium S-Oil received for a March-loading cargo this year.
S-Oil Corp and Samsung Total Petrochemicals Co are maintaining their run-rates at just above 90 percent, while Hyundai Oilbank is holding its operating rate at about 80 percent of capacity for now, industry sources said.
Hyundai, the smallest refiner in South Korea, might consider lowering its throughput if middle distillate margins continue to hover between $12 and $14 a barrel above Dubai crude, a source said.
SK Energy, which is South Korea's top refiner, plans to keep its run rate in November the same as this month due to weak margins, even though a secondary unit is expected to be back from maintenance, a source familiar with the matter said.
"Refineries have to continue to sell, except for strategic stockpiling reasons like winter kerosene, so if the market continues to be bearish, the discount on cargoes will widen," a North Asian refining source said.
Refineries are also limited as to how much they are able to lower run rates as they would already be committed to lifting term crude oil cargoes and selling a certain volume of oil products.
"Crude price falls actually hurt the refiners as they would have bought the crude based on the previous month's prices while selling the refined oil products at this month's prices," a second North Asian trader said.
"The crude oil prices have been falling since June, so margins are very bad and refineries are losing money." (Editing by Alan Raybould)

WSJ.D Technology: TSMC Is Bracing for A Battle in Chip Sector

HSINCHU, Taiwan -- At Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., hundreds of engineers have joined a newly instituted overnight shift. Their task is to come up with advanced technology to mass produce some of the world's most intricate computing chips in the shortest time possible.
Pressure is looming over the world's biggest contract chip maker by revenue, which makes the computing brains for smartphones and other gadgets. As mobile devices become smaller and more powerful, TSMC and rivals are racing neck-and-neck to pack more computing power into each chip.
Taiwan-based TSMC is preparing for an uphill battle in the coming year as rivals' more-advanced chips are set to hit the market sooner. Intel Corp., the world's biggest semiconductor maker, is entering the so-called chip foundry business -- making chips based on others' designs -- to expand the use of its plants and has secured clients such as Panasonic Corp. and Altera Corp. Morris Chang, TSMC's 83-year-old chairman, is also preparing for a leadership succession, trying to plan a smooth transition to his two co-chief executives.
"This is a war. I am not leaving anything to chance," Mr. Chang, who founded the company in 1987, said in an interview at TSMC's headquarters, located in the south of Taipei.
TSMC was one of the first major chip makers to move to 20-nanometer chip process technology last year. A chip's transistor components and the spaces between them are measured in nanometers -- a billionth of a meter. The smaller the space between components, the more powerful the chip.
That transition allowed TSMC to produce more powerful chips than most rivals at lower costs, and helped it beat out Samsung Electronics Co. for a massive order from Apple Inc. for iPhones. Thanks to Apple, which is seeing strong demand for its smartphones, TSMC's revenue rose to a record US$6.88 billion in the third quarter, its second consecutive quarterly high. On Thursday, the company is expected to report a 40% jump in net profit, according to analysts' estimates, likely setting a new high.
Still, Mr. Chang concedes that both Intel and rival Samsung will be months ahead of TSMC in adopting the next-generation chip process technology. TSMC plans to mass-produce its chips with 16-nanometer technology from the third quarter next year.
By comparison, Intel, the world's biggest chip maker by revenue, has said devices using its 14-nanometer chips will be available in October, while Samsung plans to mass produce chips on the same technology by the end of this year.
"TSMC would lose some orders to Samsung next year because of the lag, but we hope to recoup some of the lost businesses in 2016," he said, noting that TSMC plans to deliver a prototype 10-nanometer chip based on ARM Holdings PLC's design in the fourth quarter of next year.

New Wireless Race Takes Shape

Europe's largest telecom providers are gearing up for a battle in the lucrative race to connect things as diverse as cars, homes and utilities to smartphones and other wireless devices.
The "Internet of Things" market is the catchall term for an electronic device that can be wirelessly connected to the Internet. AT&T Inc. and rival Verizon Communications Inc.'s Verizon Wireless have led the charge for U.S. telecommunications operators, and have seen niche Internet of Things services such as parcel tracking expand into global businesses.
Now, after their core telecom revenue growth has been outstripped by "machine-to-machine" businesses, and with traditional revenue streams being pressed by tough market conditions, European telecom companies view the Internet of Things as a prime source of new revenue.
"We are one of the few parts of the organization that grows," says Telefonica SA's global Internet of Things chief, Surya Mendonca.
According to network-systems company Cisco Systems Inc., the value of that market is expected to grow to $19 trillion over the next 10 years, as networks for sectors such as traffic systems, shipping, rail freight and industrial manufacturing take shape. Meanwhile, the number of Internet of Things-focused developers is likely to leap to four million in 2020 from 300,000 this year, says telecom group Interoute.
It is at this junction that the telecom companies are skirmishing with technology giants such as ARM Holdings PLC, Samsung Electronics Co., Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Both telecom and technology are levering "hardware, the ubiquitous nature of connectivity, big data and analysis" in a face-off to grab expanding revenue linked to the Internet of Things, says Chris Gray, analyst at U.S. software company Red Hat Inc.
Google, Apple and Samsung have made recent inroads into homes. This year, Google bought Nest Labs, Apple is launching HomeKit and Samsung acquired SmartThings to allow users to control home settings and sync devices.
Telecom companies have significant skin in the game. Internet of Things technology works on sensors and SIM cards inside devices linked to data servers over cellular networks. Data is sent over radio waves via the SIM, sometimes via another radio transmitter. External software applications like smartphone apps pick up the signals and use the data to control devices -- for instance, a car telling a garage to open.
The need for comprehensive mobile network coverage to power the connections between devices means the telecom companies, which are investing billions of dollars to upgrade mobile infrastructure, are in prime position.
For Telefonica, Vodafone Group PLC, Orange SA and Deutsche Telekom AG, the importance of not being left behind in the race for "machine-to-machine" business means deal-making for Internet-enabled connected services and devices is increasing, analysts say.
The connected-cars sector is one of the most active.
Telefonica has a partnership with electric-car maker Tesla in major European markets and connects General Motors Co. vehicles through the car group's OnStar communications unit. Orange also works with Tesla, in France, alongside other deals with PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault SA. Orange SA is also launching smartphone service Orange Drive next year, which gives users voice-activated radio controls and tips on efficient driving.
Vodafone has signed up with Germany's BMW AG and, in August, bought Italian car-services firm Cobra Automotive. Deutsche Telekom also maintains a partnership with BMW, and last Friday joined China Mobile Ltd., the world's largest mobile provider, in a connected-cars venture.
Smart homes are another battleground. Last month, Telefonica launched a trial of AT&T's home-security, automation and energy-management platform in Europe. Deutsche Telekom has built on the 2011 launch of smart-home platform Quivicon to control appliances through partners such as Samsung and wireless-speaker maker Sonos.
Orange -- not to be left behind by the offerings of Google, Apple and Samsung -- will launch Homelive, incorporating applications with thermostats and movement detectors, later this month.
Telecom companies are also monitoring utilities, hoping to capitalize on the market as energy regulation tightens. Last year, Telefonica struck a 15-year deal valued at GBP 1.5 billion ($2.4 billion) to connect smart meters in the U.K., while Vodafone is working with energy supplier Npower to install smart meters in the country.
Orange is working with France's Electricite de France SA to track electricity consumption, through a sensor inserted into the meter. The service is expected to be introduced in France next year.

PREVIEW-S.Korea central bank seen cutting rates again this week

SEOUL, Oct 13 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank is
expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday for the second time
in three months in a further bid to re-energize an underpowered
economic recovery, a Reuters survey found on Monday.
    Of 30 analysts polled, 18 forecast the Bank of Korea would
cut its seven-day base rate at its meeting on
Wednesday. Six of the remaining 12 expect the central bank to
cut rates in November instead of this month, after third-quarter
GDP data due on Oct. 24 is published.
    "The central bank isn't viewing growing household debt as a
serious problem and some board members showed signs they could
vote to cut rates further in last month's minutes," said Kim
Jina, a fixed-income analyst at IBK Securities. 
    "The Bank of Korea will likely cut the growth forecast and
rates on Wednesday," Kim said.
    A downgrade is expected when the Bank of Korea releases the 
latest economic growth forecast on Wednesday, after Bank of
Korea Gov. Lee Ju-yeol said last week that growth is expected to
be in the mid-3 percent range this year.
    The central bank currently forecasts the economy will grow
3.8 percent this year and 4.0 percent the next. 
    Regardless of their view on the rate decision this week,
most economists agreed if the Bank of Korea decides to lower
rates again, it would be under further pressure from the
government, as was seen to be the case with the August cut.
    Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan has not explicitly
discussed the future direction of interest rates in public but
has repeated that the economy is still weak and the ongoing
recovery is slow. 
    The minister also reiterated on the sidelines of a series of
international meetings over the weekend in the United States
that there was "little difference" between the government and
central bank in their understanding of the economic situation.
    "Right now the main driving force behind the bond market is
Choi. If the central bank doesn't cut this week it'll do it
within the year," said Shin Eol, a fixed-income analyst at
Hyundai Securities.
    "Even after a second rate cut, pressure to align policy with
the government will still live on," Shin said.
    Bond yields have steadily drifted down in recent weeks on
expectations for another rate cut. The 1-year treasury bond
yield ended Friday's session at 2.164 points,
roughly 10 basis points lower than the policy rate.
    Meanwhile, recent economic indicators have been mixed, as
manufacturers reported a decline in export orders in September
while inflation hit a seven-month low last month, giving the
central bank room to cut interest rates further.
    Exports in September grew at their fastest pace in nine
months, while imports rose at their quickest since early 2012.
Housing prices across South Korea have been on a steady rise,
growing for a 13th month in September thanks to an easing in 
regulation and low interest rates.
    All but one of the 18 analysts who saw a rate cut this week
said the base rate would be lowered by 25 basis points, while
the remaining analyst said the central bank would shave off 10
basis points.

views on the next interest rate move (the current base rate is
2.25 percent):
