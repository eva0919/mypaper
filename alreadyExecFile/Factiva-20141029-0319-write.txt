LG Electronics¡¦ Net Profit Surges; Company Sells Record Number of Smartphones in Third Quarter

SEOUL¡XLG Electronics Inc. said Wednesday its third-quarter net profit nearly doubled from a year earlier after it sold a record number of smartphones.
The South Korean electronics company continued to eat into its bigger rival Samsung Electronics Co.¡¦s market share for mobile devices, particularly at home. But globally, LG is struggling against Apple Inc. and faces a newer challenge from fast-rising Chinese handset makers.
LG said its net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 87% to 203 billion won ($194 million) from 108.5 billion won a year earlier.
The company sold 16.8 million smartphones during the quarter, up 39% from 12 million sold a year earlier and a record for the company. Operating profit doubled to 461 billion won, with the mobile division accounting for more than a third of profits, the company said.
Following its second consecutive quarter of profit in the mobile division, LG said it will stick to a two-track smartphone strategy spearheaded by the company¡¦s premium G series and cheaper L series models.
Local analysts estimate LG¡¦s global market share came close to 5% in the latest quarter, a tad higher from last year¡¦s levels. But a continued tug of war is expected against upstart Chinese brands such as Xiaomi Inc., which is estimated by analysts to have sold a similar number of smartphones as LG during the same period.
LG is better positioned in South Korea, where it grabbed a 27% handset market share in the third quarter, its highest in years, and up from just 18% a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. During the same period, Samsung¡¦s share slipped to 60% from 66%, according to the same estimates.
LG executives hope the progress it is making at home will translate into overseas sales.
¡§Before, they [overseas partners] didn¡¦t even spare us a glance. But now, most carriers take our products without any doubt,¡¨ said Chris Yie, a vice president for marketing at LG¡¦s mobile division, said in a recent interview.
The number of global carriers that placed orders for LG¡¦s latest G3 smartphone at launch was roughly 170, up by 30% from the previous model, Mr. Yie said. The big four U.S. telecom companies¡XVerizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp.¡Xall sell the G3. Analysts estimate Samsung to have had roughly 200 carrier partners for the launch of its latest top-of-the-line model, the Galaxy S5.

Bankers still feeling the buzz of Alibaba Group¡¦s blockbuster listing last month have been casting around for the next big tech deal out of China. If the appetite by creditors to lend to Xiaomi Inc. is anything to go by, this four-year-old smartphone maker could be it.
Xiaomi, which sells more smartphones than even Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. in China, has borrowed $1 billion from 29 banks for a three-year loan, its first move to tap overseas funds for cash. The smartphone maker has moved beyond China to sell in India and Indonesia, and a person familiar with the loan said it is raising the funds from the loan to expand overseas.
The three-year, $1 billion loan is set to close Friday, with Brazil¡¦s Banco do Brasil to Japan¡¦s Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ among the 29 that have joined Wall Street and Chinese banks as lenders, people familiar with the matter said.
The lead bankers on the loan are Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, with Credit Suisse Group and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also taking part.
In attracting so many banks to its loan, Xiaomi has beaten Alibaba, which borrowed $8 billion last year from 22 banks, many of whom, bankers said, were eager to get in on the Chinese e-commerce giant¡¦s IPO mandate.

Facebook Vows Aggressive Spending --- Zuckerberg Defends Long-Term Bets; Social Network Predicts Expenses Could Jump 75% This Year

Facebook Inc. chief Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday vowed to continue spending abundantly on new technologies in the coming years, explaining away a quarterly profit that took a hit from megadeals such as WhatsApp.
The social network's revenue rose 59% to $3.2 billion in the third quarter as it continues to make gains in mobile advertising at the expense of larger rival Google Inc.
But costs rose 41% during a quarter in which Facebook added roughly 1,200 new employees, most of them through several acquisitions including the $19 billion deal for messaging app WhatsApp and a $2 billion purchase of virtual-reality headset maker Oculus Rift.
On a conference call with analysts, finance chief David Wehner said he expects Facebook to incur higher expenses than normal in the quarters to come, in the wake of big investments in both engineering talent and acquisitions. He expects costs to rise as much as 75% for the year.
Mr. Wehner and other Facebook executives urged analysts and investors to look further into the future, and not just at the financial results before them. Mr. Zuckerberg kicked off the call by stressing the company's long-term goals stretch more than a decade into the future and require "investing aggressively."
Mr. Zuckerberg pointed to virtual reality, artificial intelligence and connecting people in remote parts of the planet to the Internet. "Products don't really get that interesting to turn into businesses until they have about a billion people using them," Mr. Zuckerberg said, adding that Facebook has a number of services that could reach that threshold in a "five-year time frame."
The remarks sent Facebook's stock, which had gained nearly 50% this year, tumbling 9.7% in after-hours trading to $72.90.
Facebook is in a high-stakes arms race with other cash-rich technology companies battling for supremacy in a constantly changing digital landscape. Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. are also on spending binges, whether through new acquisitions or research and development, to expand beyond their core businesses and into a wealth of new areas. Google, for example, has expanded into smartphones, streaming-video devices, eyewear, artificial intelligence and transportation in the past couple of years.
Despite the outlook, Mr. Wehner said in an interview he was happy with Facebook's performance in the quarter. "We feel like we're performing well by every measure."
Those measures include user growth, which Facebook is proving it can still add millions of new members per quarter especially overseas. The company added 33 million more monthly active users in the quarter to give it 1.35 billion, meaning nearly half the Internet-connected world now logs into the service on average once a month.
More impressive, growth in its daily active users -- the people Facebook says are the most engaged -- rose by 35 million, or 4.2%, from three months earlier, the highest jump in that rate since the second quarter of 2013. It means 64% of Facebook's users log in daily, a percentage that keeps climbing.
The results come a day after smaller rival Twitter Inc. showed signs again of slowing user growth, alarming shareholders who sent the stock down nearly 10% on Tuesday. Facebook now has well over four times the monthly users than Twitter.
Facebook nearly doubled its profit to a best-ever $802 million. About 66% of its ad revenue now comes from mobile devices, up from 62% three months ago and 49% a year earlier.
Investors have lauded Facebook for its ability to push that percentage ever higher, showing it can quickly adapt to changing trends in the marketplace, including the shift to smartphones and tablet computers.
According to eMarketer, Facebook will control 20% of the global mobile Internet ad industry by year-end. Google is seeing its grip on that market loosen. Its share of that $36 billion market is expected to drop to 45% from 50% two years ago.
"Facebook is the beachhead for mobile," said Rajeev Chand, an analyst at Rutberg & Co. For advertisers, "There's no other place to get reach and engagement at this scale," he said.
Facebook's mobile business has room to grow. The company has only just begun to sell ads on Instagram, the photo-sharing product it acquired in 2012. It also recently launched its first mobile-ad network called Audience Network, which allows companies to purchase ads targeted at Facebook users that appear on other partner apps, such as reality TV star Kim Kardashian's successful mobile game.
The social network also recently acquired WhatsApp, a popular text and voice communications app. It hasn't said how it plans to make money from WhatsApp, but investors are already looking at their watches. Facebook said in a filing on Tuesday that WhatsApp lost $232.5 million in the first half of this year, on revenue of $15.3 million from selling 99-cent annual subscriptions.
"I don't think we're anywhere close" to monetizing WhatsApp, said Dan Salmon, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
Facebook has been able to add hundreds of millions of users over recent years despite near saturation. To accomplish that goal, it is focused mainly on developing countries, where declining smartphone prices and cheaper data connections have linked a generation of people to the Internet for the first time.
In the U.S. and Canada, Facebook added two million monthly users quarter-over-quarter, but in Asia and the rest of the world, it added 28 million. But Facebook made an average of $7.39 per user in the U.S. and Canada last quarter, and only $1.18 in Asia and 85 cents in the rest of the world, down a penny quarter-over-quarter.

With a Chance of Rain
David H. Koch Theater
Through Nov. 2
Raymonda Divertissements
David H. Koch Theater
Through Nov. 1
Kontakthof
BAM Howard Gilman Opera House
Through Nov. 2
New York -- American Ballet Theatre won't turn 75 until next year, but its current season at the David H. Koch Theater initiates a yearlong celebration of that anniversary. The programming that makes up the run consciously reflects the troupe's past as well as its present.
Liam Scarlett's "With a Chance of Rain," which had its world premiere at the gala opening last week, takes inspiration from seven Sergei Rachmaninoff piano pieces. Both casts chosen by Mr. Scarlett to present his ballet did so confidently. But given the strange-to-the-point-of-schizophrenic dance they've been asked to perform, it looks as if the inexplicably named "With a Chance of Rain" will soon fall into the obscurity met by all the new ballets that ABT, then Ballet Theatre, offered in 1940, its inaugural year.
Mr. Scarlett has costumed his dancers in sleek, skintight versions of workout wear, with ice blue a central hue. Choreographically, his 30-minute ballet takes shape as a suite of sometimes acrobatic, fluent solos and duets that are intermittently tricked out with extraneous, gestural moments. These include such indecorous details as the groping of a woman's buttock, the jiggling of her bosom, some silly pelvic waggling, and the nonchalant dropping to the stage of women by their feckless partners.
By its end, which features the leading couple in a pas de deux -- to Rachmaninoff's "Elegie, Op. 3 No. 1" -- that presents its woman in variously expansive and melting modes, the ballet gets clear of its eccentric tics to climax on a rapturous note. For all its art, however, this soaring conclusion -- captured by either an impassioned Marcelo Gomes and a filament-fine Hee Seo or by a limpid Cory Stearns and a lyrical Isabella Boylston -- can't quite erase the weird and often off-putting details that dot the previous sections.
Also new to the repertory is "Raymonda Divertissements," a reworked excerpt from Marius Petipa's spectacle ballet that has been staged caringly by ABT artistic director Kevin McKenzie and company balletmaster Irina Kolpakova. The all-dance showcase to the lush, Hungarian-tinged music of Alexander Glazunov is dressed by Barbara Matera in fur-trimmed costumes inspired by those of the original 1898 St. Petersburg production.
While this presentation of 19th-century-style classical ballet feels somewhat slight due to its pared-back, about 20-minute length, it makes rigorous demands of its dancers, which ABT's men and women mostly met with ease. Particularly impressive so far have been Ms. Seo, for her shimmering line and finesse, and a radiant, authoritative Gillian Murphy. In the lesser solo roles, Skylar Brandt, Christine Shevchenko and -- most especially -- Devon Teuscher all stood out for their strength and clarity. So far, however neither of the leading men has shone especially brightly: James Whiteside showed more brashness than heroic mien; Alexandre Hammoudi looked insecure.

Brooklyn, N.Y. -- To mark the 30th anniversary of the New York debut of Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, BAM is presenting "Kontakthof," a production originally titled "Kontakthof fur Damen und Herren" and created in 1978 by Bausch, who died in 2009.
Bausch's name has become synonymous with the genre of dance-theater, which the choreographer helped establish and led. She called upon her international troupe of dance-trained men and women to work with her to intermix physical movement with spoken elements associated with dramatic theater and delivered in an array of languages reflecting her performers' origins.
While the three-hour (including intermission) "Kontakthof" reveals much that is familiar from Bausch's usually lengthy, episodic productions of later years, it also offers a look at what might be called more "classical" Bausch. Unlike those later offerings -- which tended to be inspired by locales where the German-based company established temporary residence and which seemed more free-form and collagelike -- "Kontakthof" has a clearer beginning, middle and end. If you've never experienced the world of Pina Bausch, this might be as good a start as any.
The stage and costume designs are by Rolf Borzik, who until his death in 1980 regularly collaborated with Bausch. The setting -- that is, the "contact room" -- looks like an unremarkable social hall with a curtained stage and an array of 27 chairs. For the duration of "Kontakthof," it is peopled by a cast of 23 men and women. The music, as is typical for Bausch, is a set of recorded tracks; promotional materials categorize these as songs from the 1930s, often in German but somehow familiar.
The actions and interactions of the women, dressed in various kinds of cocktail dresses and usually high-heeled pumps, and the men in two-piece suits with shirts and ties, tread a line between the everyday and the absurd: blond-haired Julie Shanahan eats a green apple here; frizzy-haired Nazareth Panadero runs screaming from the sight of a toy mouse tossed at her feet there.
The work presents an arc that climactically takes us back to a wittily arranged circle dance -- where the men and women parade while gesturing casually with their hands and express utter boredom by, in unison, exhaling cheek-filling breaths. And, along the way, Bausch's choreographic theatrics range from large actions, such as frantic runs from imagined terrors, to the tiniest of moves, such as the tapping of a nose. All get executed with deft precision.
When "Kontakthof" takes us from a strange scene of 11 men delicately but rather creepily toying with Ms. Panadero's sleepy body, the bored circle dance that replaces it comes as a terrific release. Up to that point, recurring battles of the sexes come in many Bausch-styled varieties. Often the audience laughs; likewise you sense bewilderment in its attentive silence. Whatever reactions Bausch's stage pictures prompt, they're usually strong ones. Her special theatrics make no time for the ineffectual or noncommittal.

Apple Pay Is a Breeze to Use, But Still Too Hard To Find

You no longer have to be a geek to pay for something with your phone.
Last week, owners of the iPhone 6 got Apple Pay, a free service that lets you buy things at stores and inside apps using a digital version of your credit card and a thumbprint. Shortly after Apple switched it on, I walked to McDonald's without my wallet and bought McNuggets with a wave of my iPhone. It was so easy, the cashier didn't even notice.
PayPal, Google and others have been trying for years to get us to pay with phones. But their systems made shopping harder, not easier. Apple Pay doesn't require you to set up a special account or preload it with money. There's no app you must open to pay, no special password to remember. Checkout is more secure even than with plastic.
Apple Pay changes the way we look at our phones, not to mention wallets full of credit cards and bits of paper. It is the first such service I trust to be secure and consistently easy -- fundamentals to taking a digital wallet mainstream.
But it is also just getting started. For the past week, I've been using Apple Pay everywhere I could find it -- not nearly enough places for me to leave my wallet at home. A few shortsighted chains have even pulled support for it.
To change our habits of paying with cash and plastic, Apple Pay needs more capabilities, such as standing in for all of your buy-10-get-1-free punch cards, to give you more reasons to pay with a phone.
Still, Apple Pay is our best hope yet of putting overstuffed wallets on a digital diet. Anyone with a new iPhone should give it a try.
To set up Apple Pay on an iPhone 6, tap the plus sign in the included Passbook app. You only have to do this once: The app will prompt you to add one of your existing credit cards by typing in its digits or snapping a photo. Apple Pay works with most existing major credit and debit cards, which you can add to your phone in a matter of minutes. The exceptions are cards from some smaller banks, store-branded cards and corporate cards. Apple is working to fill those holes.
At the store, look for an Apple Pay logo, or more likely the universal contactless payment logo -- a sideways Wi-Fi symbol with a hand approaching it. Once you're rung up, hold your iPhone near the credit-card terminal. You don't have to tap or swipe -- the connection happens over a wireless system called near-field communication, or NFC.
When your iPhone gets close enough, an image of your credit cards appears on its screen, even if the phone is asleep or you're playing "Candy Crush Saga." If you're ready to pay, lightly put your finger on the Touch ID sensor to approve it.
If you want to pick a card other than your designated default card, just tap one, then do the finger scan. Nobody else's finger will work unless you've registered that person's print on your phone. (I tried.)
At most stores, that's it -- you're done. A few might ask you to sign a receipt or punch in your debit card's PIN. In my tests, only one sales clerk got confused, and we figured it out together.
Contrast that with an experience I had earlier this year with the competing PayPal app while heading to lunch with colleagues. PayPal had hired people to stand in front of the restaurant, telling people they'd get $5 off if they paid with its app. But doing that required downloading the app, remembering your PayPal password, finding the restaurant in the app then tapping to pay there. Most of my friends decided they'd rather forgo $5 than pay by phone.
Google Wallet and Softcard, a joint effort of AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon that works on some NFC-equipped Android phones, aren't much better. Both require you to unlock your phone and type a code into an app. That's too many steps to be convenient.
Apple Pay may be simple, but is it safe? A number of security experts I've spoken with call it more secure than carrying a plastic credit card.
That's hard to believe considering that iPhones couldn't keep sensitive celebrity photos away from hackers. But with a regular credit card, your account details are relatively easy to steal. Apple Pay doesn't even store your credit-card number, just a unique code that's a stand-in for your card, hidden on a part of the phone that doesn't get backed up online.
If you lose your iPhone, you don't have to reissue all your credit cards. Instead, you can suspend payments via Apple's Find My iPhone website. A thief shouldn't be able to make purchases with your phone unless they have your thumbprint or, egads, your thumb.
There was one serious hiccup in Apple Pay's first week. Some people with credit cards from
Bank of America got repeat charges. But the bank recognized the problem and fixed it. Its response underscores one of the best safety features of Apple Pay: Because it is tied to a regular credit-card account, you aren't liable for purchases you didn't make.
One of the biggest risks of Apple Pay comes from fraudsters who might enter stolen cards into an iPhone and link it to their own fingerprints. To ward that off, some banks ask you to confirm that you are legit by calling a hotline when adding their card.
The worst part about using Apple Pay has been finding places that accept it. It works at over 220,000 U.S. locations, including national chains like Chevron, Macy's, Nike, Office Depot, Walgreens and Whole Foods. But even there, it may not be at every gas pump or checkout station. That's just a sliver of American retail, and a guy can only eat so much McDonald's and Subway. There isn't even an app -- yet -- that'll tell you which nearby stores take Apple Pay.
Job One for Apple is signing up more merchants. Its system benefits banks and shoppers but doesn't give stores much incentive to install the needed equipment. Apple Pay doesn't offer them cheaper transaction fees or more customer information.
Some stores with the right equipment, including CVS and Rite-Aid, have blocked Apple Pay. A competing service, CurrentC, will launch next year. Both those chains are among its backers. Unfortunately, from early reports, it sounds like CurrentC will be a step backward in usability: You pay by scanning a code inside a smartphone app.
The hardest question for Apple Pay right now is: Why bother? Chances are you have your phone close at hand at checkout. It is a beat quicker to use Apple Pay than to retrieve and swipe a credit card. But just a beat.
I'd consider it more useful if Apple Pay could address my George Costanza-style exploding wallet, so overstuffed with junk it makes me sit at a tilt. To do that, my iPhone would need to store receipts, work on public transportation and unlock the office doors, too.
I'd be more inclined to pay with my phone if it also doubled as one of those loyalty cards I'm always misplacing. Even though it isn't as convenient as Apple Pay, I regularly use the Starbucks app to buy coffee because I get a free cup every so often.
There's a ways to go before we're all paying for things with our phones. But Apple Pay has laid a blueprint for it that makes more sense than any option before.

SoundCloud Needs to Prove Itself for Partnership With Universal; Universal Music Group Chairman Lucian Grainge said he wants to see more evidence of a sustainable business model

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.¡XUniversal Music Group Chairman Lucian Grainge said he wants to see more evidence of a sustainable business model before partnering with digital-music startup SoundCloud.
In comments at the WSJD Live Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, the record mogul said there is an ¡§opportunity for SoundCloud to create incredible revenue.¡¨ But, Mr. Grainge said, he and SoundCloud would first have to discuss ¡§what the business plan is going to be.¡¨
The interview was one of three sessions at the conference featuring entertainment-industry pioneers, including Mr. Grainge, SoundCloud founder Alexander Ljung and DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg. In separate conversations on Tuesday, the three men discussed emerging business models for creating new forms of revenue for the music and film industries.
They also all managed to dodge or deflect some of the many rumors about partnerships swirling in an industry fast moving toward consolidation.
Mr. Ljung, appearing after Mr. Grainge, wouldn¡¦t comment directly on a potential partnership with Universal. The startup¡¦s first ad offering, called On SoundCloud, was announced earlier this year, without support from any of the major labels.
¡§We won¡¦t have everybody in from day one,¡¨ Mr. Ljung said. ¡§Our intention is to create something that¡¦s valuable for everybody and so valuable that everybody wants to be in. We¡¦re not there yet.¡¨
The pressure on Mr. Ljung to work with the major labels is likely to increase. SoundCloud has 175 million users, but said it lost $29 million last year on revenue of just $14 million.
For his part, Mr. Grainge didn¡¦t contest reports that Universal may team up with Google Inc.¡¦s YouTube for a subscription music service.
¡§We¡¦re very good partners with people where we¡¦re aligned,¡¨ he said. But, he added, ¡§I can¡¦t comment on something that hasn¡¦t been announced.¡¨
The Wall Street Journal has previously reported that Universal is working on a paid music service with YouTube.
The mega label¡¦s latest foray illustrates how the music industry is reaching far and wide to maintain revenue amid declining sales of CDs and downloaded music.
¡§We¡¦re in the experimental phase at the moment,¡¨ he said. ¡§The last two or three years has been about stopping the decline and creating as many platforms and as many services and opportunities to capture money.¡¨
The Journal last week reported that music sales at Apple¡¦s iTunes Store have fallen 13% to 14% worldwide since the start of the year, much steeper than the decline in 2013. Mr. Grainge said that subscription services like Spotify are making up for decline in download sales but not for the decline in record sales.
Mr. Katzenberg¡¦s non-answer came when he was asked to discuss recent discussions with Japanese telecom giant SoftBank. The Journal reported the discussions could have led to a content-distribution partnership, or a SoftBank investment in DreamWorks rather than an outright acquisition.
Mr. Katzenberg declined to comment, calling SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son ¡§one of the greatest entrepreneurs in the world.¡¨
The growing importance of Chinese consumers, and Chinese tech companies, has been a recurring theme at the WSJD conference this week. Mr. Katzenberg, who was among the first Hollywood executives to cultivate ties with China¡¦s movie industry, said the country was essential to the future of the entertainment business.
¡§To not be there, I think is to miss an extraordinary opportunity,¡¨ Mr. Katzenberg said Tuesday night.
Still, he acknowledged the risks of making movies in China, where DreamWorks and other foreign studios are required to work with local investment partners. ¡§You can¡¦t be there and not play by their rules,¡¨ he said.

TSMC Adds LG To Customer Base

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has boosted its profile in the chip-manufacturing industry by signing deals with Apple Inc., has added LG Electronics Inc. to its list of customers for the high-tech chipsets used in smartphones.
LG Electronics said Friday that it has developed its own microprocessor to power a variation of its flagship G3 smartphone, a first for the South Korean electronics company. Thus far, LG has relied mainly on Qualcomm Inc. for the chips that run its smartphones.
"The chips will be made by TSMC, as LG doesn't have chip factories," a person familiar with the matter said. He said LG and TSMC have been working together for months to develop the new chipset, dubbed Nuclun, but didn't provide further details.
Specifications for the Nuclun aren't quite at top-notch level, but they are similar to the chips that power other premium smartphones, according to LG. For example, one version of Samsung Electronics Co.'s Galaxy Note 4 smartphone comes with a mobile processor similar in structure to the Nuclun, just slightly faster.
With the new push into chip development, LG said it was aiming to further diversify its product strategy against stronger competition. Following a period of losses, LG's mobile unit has been in recovery in recent months thanks to a better-than-expected reception for the company's G3 model, which was launched earlier this year.
But it is too early to tell if LG's internally developed chipsets will bring the company success. Making the right microprocessor has been a challenge even for Samsung, which has a long history of expertise in chip making, analysts say. Samsung-branded mobile processors, called the Exynos series, haven't been a popular choice, even for its Galaxy lineup of smartphones. LG used to have its own chip business but divested itself of the division in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s as a part of a broad restructuring of the country's conglomerates.

Sanofi's Low Blood Sugar
Chris Viehbacher's job just got harder.
The chief executive of Sanofi reportedly wrote to his board asking directors to dismiss rumors that he could be replaced as boss of the French drug maker. Now, a sudden surge in price competition in the U.S. that casts a pall over the company's growth prospects isn't helping his cause.
Indeed, Sanofi's shares dropped 11% after it bemoaned the mounting pressure on its prized diabetes business. And, judging by the experience of U.K. peer GlaxoSmithKline, this could be a lasting drag.
It isn't clear why Sanofi's diabetes business, which contributes about one-fifth of sales, suddenly slowed. It posted 8% sales growth in the third quarter after a healthy 15% rise in the first half.
More important, Sanofi pointed to "aggressive discounting" by rivals in the U.S. as reason to think sales would be flat in 2015 compared with this year.
In what is effectively a two-player market, that is a jibe at Denmark's Novo Nordisk. Sanofi's outlook implies a price decline of 10% to 15% next year. But, notes Barclays, if price competition is heating up it isn't showing in prescriptions: the pair's market shares are currently stable.
This tale, in some ways, mirrors the experience of Glaxo. Sales of its respiratory drug Advair, which accounted for 20% of sales last year, have been shrinking. U.S. primary-care providers have been demanding higher rebates on products, playing off different drug makers against one another. Those woes have weighed on Glaxo, which also has struggled to convince investors it can replace Advair's lost sales with new respiratory products.
Sanofi should be in a stronger position. It operates in an effective duopoly. The French company pushed through three double-digit price increases on insulin Lantus last year, boosting sales, and there is still volume growth in the U.S. market.
The apparent pickup in tit-for-tat discounting is alarming, though. Novo Nordisk and Sanofi are likely watching each other's next launch. Novo Nordisk's next-generation insulin won't hit the U.S. before 2016. But if the Danish company is cutting prices, that could be an attempt to derail Sanofi's launch of its new insulin, Toujeo, expected next year.
Alternatively, Sanofi may have been overly eager to shore up Lantus's position with health-care providers. That could convince investors it can switch patients to its new product, with the threat of a biosimilar version of Lantus from Eli Lilly looming.
Sanofi, like Glaxo, has been trading at a discount to the European pharmaceuticals sector. That widened Tuesday to about 15%. Given Glaxo's ongoing battle to defend its lead in the U.S. respiratory business, such caution is warranted until more is known about Sanofi's outlook in diabetes.
Meanwhile, this latest upset is hardly likely to quiet chatter about Mr. Viehbacher's position.

StanChart Hit
By Past Growth
Standard Chartered's growth strategy is coming home to roost.
Asia had been the growth engine of the U.K.-listed bank, which notched up double-digit annual profit increases frequently in the past decade. However, on Tuesday the same region was behind the bank's second profit warning this year, sending shares plunging 8.8% to a five-year low.
Impairment charges due to bad loans, made mostly in emerging markets, rose 86% in the third quarter and are up by 36% for the first nine months of this year. In its business-banking and financial-markets division alone, Standard Chartered's main source of growth, impairments could rise by 60% this year, says Jefferies.
This sets off a potential domino effect: As well as taking a bite out of earnings, bad credit can mean higher risk weightings in its loan book, putting further pressure on capital ratios. As loans deteriorate, Standard Chartered has had to reduce risk in its portfolio. But that has resulted in a drop in lending -- which in turn lowers future revenue growth. At the end of the third quarter, its loans to customers had fallen by 3% compared with three months before.
Standard Chartered has been hit by a perfect storm of macro events, with lower-than-expected growth in emerging markets, declining commodity prices and a strengthening dollar with the specter of rising rates.
But the bank is also suffering from idiosyncratic problems that hark back to its growth strategy of chasing revenue ahead of controlling risk. Compared with HSBC, another U.K. bank with roots in emerging markets, Standard Chartered has suffered a higher rate of loan impairments so far this year. The former hasn't reported third-quarter results, but in the first half of 2014, HSBC's loan impairments fell 40% year on year.
Meanwhile, Standard Chartered's total loan-loss reserves compared with nonperforming loans in business banking dropped to 46% in 2013 from 91% in 2007, notes Jefferies.
Standard Chartered is trading at 8.3 times 2015 earnings, compared with HSBC at about 10 times. But as Standard Chartered battles its impairment problems, it also risks eating into tomorrow's earnings growth. Investors still risk getting egg on their face.

China Takes Nuclear-Energy Risk
Nuclear energy: It's risky stuff. Hence, there is often a heavy degree of government control over it -- which makes it a doubly risky investment proposition.
Especially when that government is China's.
A number of Chinese state-owned nuclear companies are going public these days. CGN Power, the country's largest with 9.4 gigawatts of operating capacity, will likely offer $3 billion of new shares in Hong Kong next month, reports The Wall Street Journal.
A small affiliate, CGN Meiya Power, raised $262 million in Hong Kong last month and has seen its shares rise by 20% since. Meanwhile, another top operator, China National Nuclear Power, also plans an initial public offering.
Once listed, these will be among a handful of stocks globally, including the likes of Exelon of the U.S. and EDF of France, offering high or pure exposure to nuclear energy.
And while much of the rest of the world is ambivalent about or hostile to nuclear energy, Beijing has big expansion plans. The Chinese government suspended new project approvals after Japan's Fukushima accident in March 2011.
But the need to diversify away from smog-causing coal has put its nuclear ambitions back on track. China now targets nearly tripling the nuclear capacity that is up and running to 58 gigawatts by 2020. The IPOs will help fund that ambition.
The state's involvement can cut both ways, though. CGN sells most of its output to state-run electricity grids at regulated tariffs. For power plants that began operating before 2013, these tariffs are tailored to yield a "reasonable" profit, according to CGN's prospectus. Yet its net profit has fallen since 2011 because of either surging costs or weakening sales.
For newer plants, the tariff is supposed to be fixed -- except when it isn't. In a bid to avoid competition, these plants are required to cut tariffs if neighboring coal-fired power is cheaper. That is quite likely as coal prices spiral downward.
Energy prices are heavily regulated precisely because consumers are rather attached to light and heat. That makes them subject to political, as well as economic, forces.
In France, for example, shares in state-run EDF tanked 14% in June when the government scrapped a planned tariff increase. There is even more reason to worry in China since governments could keep down power prices as a stimulus to troubled heavy industries.
Growth prospects are high, which is likely one reason that CGN already trades at 10.9 times 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That is far higher than EDF's 4.8 times or Exelon's 6.6 times.
Double-digit multiples are no doubt tempting for IPO bankers but look too much for a large nuclear generator carrying this much political risk. The problem is, CGN's balance sheet means it needs a high multiple, or fast growth in profits, to make its IPO math work.
Net debt as of this March is a hefty 5.1 times 2013 Ebitda, and still high at four times even if related-party loans are excluded. And less than 10% of the IPO proceeds are currently earmarked for paying off borrowings. As if nuclear power wasn't risky enough.

Inflation
Shapes
Sweden's
Rate Path
The Riksbank's interest-rate journey has gone full circle. The decisions of the Swedish central bank may yet have wider resonance.
The Riksbank reduced its main policy rate Tuesday to zero from 0.25% and indicated there would be no increases before mid-2016. That marks the culmination of a grand reversal: between June 2010 and July 2011, the Riksbank had raised rates by 1.75 percentage points to 2%. But by December 2011 it was cutting them again. Rates are now lower than in the wake of the global financial crisis.
As elsewhere in developed markets, like the U.S. and U.K., growth isn't the problem. Sweden bounced back swiftly from 2008's turmoil, and the Riksbank forecasts growth of 1.9% in 2014, 2.7% in 2015 and 3.3% in 2016. Unemployment has been falling and is expected to fall further.
But inflation is nowhere to be seen. September's reading came in at minus 0.4%; in 2013, average inflation was just below zero. In part this is due to lower food and energy prices, the effects of which are being felt widely. But even services inflation stood at just 0.5% in September, UBS notes. The Riksbank is way off its target of 2% for headline inflation.
The problem for the Riksbank in cutting rates lies in the risk to financial stability. Swedish house prices have risen steeply and households are heavily indebted. So-called macroprudential policy, which aims to reduce financial stability risks, has so far had little effect on debt, which stands at 170% of household disposable income.
Sweden's challenges are playing out elsewhere, albeit less urgently. In both the U.S. and U.K., there is a similar mix of concerns about the risks ultraloose policy poses to financial stability. But inflation is increasingly in focus, as it is falling quickly, albeit still comfortably in positive territory. If that is mostly down to lower food and energy prices, it is effectively a tax cut for consumers, and a boon for the economy. But if inflation moves far away from target, potentially affecting expectations, it is a big concern for central banks.
The Riksbank's reversal may make those already hesitant about raising rates elsewhere a little more so. The chance of rates staying lower for even longer is slowly rising.

Apple may or may not strike a partnership with Alibaba, but the iPhone maker has strong reasons for wanting to find new ways to grow its business in China.
During onstage interviews at the WSJD Live conference Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alibaba CEO Jack Ma threw out hints they would like to work together, possibly on something involving Alibaba's online payment service called Alipay. Theoretically, the service could work with Apple's Touch ID function embedded on the newest iPhones. But many questions remain, especially given Apple's drive to grow its own payment service.
What is clear is that the Chinese market grows more important for Apple with each passing year. Its annual securities filing, also out Monday, showed Greater China to be the fastest-growing of the company's geographic segments.
Apple may not always play well with others. But with its eyes on China, it could be more motivated to make new friends.

REFILE-Former Google executive gets into payment terminals

(Changes dateline and reporting credit line)               
LAGUNA BEACH, Calif., Oct 28 (Reuters) - The former head of Google Inc's mobile wallet is drawing on the lessons of that failed initiative in his latest payments startup, Poynt.               
The startup founded by Osama Bedier, also a former PayPal executive, is launching on Wednesday a point-of-sale device that competes with the required payment terminals now used by restaurants, retailers and other small businesses throughout the United States.               
The launch comes a year before U.S. merchants will have to meet a deadline to adopt "EMV" chip technology that would make credit cards more secure.               
Unlike older systems that will have to be expanded or replaced over time to support new innovations such as contactless mobile payments, Poynt says its terminal comes with a full range of capabilities at the same price.               
Its terminal, which will be disseminated to merchants by banks, can accept a variety of credit cards, including more secure chip-and-pin credit cards and Apple Pay, the mobile payments service Apple Inc launched last week. It also comes with wireless capability.               
"No one is tackling the terminal itself," Bedier said in an interview. "A phone is an essential device for the consumer. The terminal is required device for the merchant."               
The $299 device will be shipped to merchants in the first quarter, but developers can get an early version of the device for $499 in the fourth quarter.               
Poynt does not compete with the likes of Square and Stripe, which focus on other aspects of the payments, said Bedier, who left Google last year to work on Poynt full time.               
The startup has spent the last 18 months getting the necessary authorization to function as a payments terminal. Poynt is ironing out deals with two major banks, which will then disseminate the terminal to merchants.               
Bedier hopes to get five banks signed on by the end of next year.               
The decision to compete with point-of-sale terminal makers like Verifone Systems Inc in an often-overlooked area of the complex payments infrastructure stems from the hard lessons from Bedier's time at PayPal and Google.               
Both companies focused on upending long-held habits among consumers and retailers. Poynt is focused on improving a device that every retailer must have, at a time merchants are already planning to overhaul their terminals.

Renren CEO Seeks Sale Of Some Noncore Units

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. -- Chinese social-network company Renren Inc. is planning to sell some noncore businesses as it works to sustain profits and is considering potential investments in the U.S. and Hong Kong, its chief executive said.
"The business in the current form -- it's difficult to make money. We are transforming fundamentally to change how we do business," Joe Chen, also the company's founder and chairman, said in an interview Monday on the sidelines of the WSJD Live global technology conference.
Renren was once described as the Facebook of China when it first gained prominence as a platform resembling the social-media service offered by Facebook Inc., which is blocked in that country. Founded in 2005, the New York Stock Exchange-listed, Beijing-based company has since diversified into services including online games, online video and e-commerce, as well as providing group buying and professional social-networking services similar to LinkedIn.
Despite having 214 million monthly active users on its platform at the end of June, Renren hasn't been steadily profitable since its inception in 2005, Mr. Chen said. In the second quarter it reported earnings of $31.3 million, including an $86 million gain from short-term investments, on revenue of $25 million. It reported a $30.4 million loss from operations during the quarter.
The third quarter could be tougher. It estimates revenue declined to between $19 million and $21 million during the period. Mr. Chen blamed rising competition from giants like Tencent Holdings Ltd., the Chinese company behind the popular mobile-messaging app WeChat, which has more than 438 million monthly active users.
"The social-media landscape is increasingly being dominated by Tencent. Operationally, we aren't doing so well because there are dominant players," he said.
Mr. Chen wouldn't say which businesses the company wants to divest next after Renren sold its e-commerce operations to Baidu Inc. in August last year. The company is also open to joint ventures with bigger technology companies in areas outside of social networking, which is its core business.
But he said more strategic investments are likely because Renren wants to invest in innovative startups that could further the company's growth. The company is considering an investment in a Hong Kong-based startup, though Mr. Chen declined to give further details. The company has about $800 million set aside for strategic investments, he said.
"We don't want to be too complacent -- but not too aggressive -- and we're on the lookout for the best deals," he said.
Renren has already made some investments in the U.S. as part of its plans to look beyond China for opportunities. For example, about a half year ago, the company invested $1 million in Yik Yak, an Atlanta-based social-media app available on phones running Google Inc.'s Android and Apple Inc's iOS mobile-operating systems. In May, Renren led a $31 million investment in Fundrise, a Washington, D.C., real-estate crowdfunding platform. It is also the largest shareholder in Social Finance Inc., a startup that offers inexpensive student loans.
Mr. Chen said that several years ago, the company looked at potentially investing in the popular messaging app Snapchat, which has garnered interest from tech giants including Yahoo Inc., China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Facebook.
Tencent ended up buying a stake in Snapchat for an undisclosed amount last year. People familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal in recent weeks that Yahoo has committed an investment in Snapchat at a $10 billion valuation.
Two areas where Renren is looking to expand include student financing -- offering loans to students in mainland China for a fee -- as well as online education.
"These are different ways to monetize. We are just starting in this area but we're going after these markets that are being ignored," Mr. Chen said.

Payments Dream Team In the Making in China?

A possible alliance in electronic payments between two of the tech world's hottest companies -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Apple Inc. -- could open doors for both in China, the world's biggest e-commerce market.
But analysts and payment experts say such an alliance, which was suggested Monday by Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma during an interview at the WSJD Live global technology conference, would face a host of technical and possibly regulatory hurdles.
Mr. Ma said that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that last month raised $25 billion in the world's biggest-ever initial public offering, is interested in partnering with iPhone maker Apple in payments. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the same conference that he is going to meet with Mr. Ma to discuss partnerships, without specifying what kind.
Any such partnership could be a formidable force in China, where Alibaba controls roughly 80% of the country's online shopping market, valued at around $302 billion last year, according to the Chinese government.
Alibaba's payment affiliate, Alipay, already handles a bulk of those online transactions, as well as a small share of in-store purchases. It is trying to expand further into payments at brick-and-mortar venues -- from shops to restaurants, taxis and theaters. Analysts say it could make headway with a tie-up that allows iPhone users to pay for goods from Alipay accounts with a tap of their handsets.
Apple recently launched its own payment system, called Apple Pay. Working with Alipay in China could give the U.S. company access to Alipay's powerful transactions-settling system, which is already used by hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses. It would also let Apple take advantage of Alipay's existing agreements with more than 200 Chinese financial institutions, which allow users to transfer money from their bank accounts to Alipay accounts.
Apple Pay, a feature of the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, uses a smart-chip technology that lets users pay by bringing their phones near an electronic reader, but it isn't yet available in China.
A partnership with Apple would allow Alibaba to get access to information on payments made in brick-and-mortar stores through Apple Pay, analysts say.
"If Alipay wants to collect more data on offline payments from high-end customers, working with Apple would make sense," said Forrester Research analyst Bryan Wang, noting that iPhone owners in China tend to be affluent.
For payments at stores, Alipay currently uses QR codes -- complex patterns that can be scanned by smartphone cameras -- as well as a technology that beams payment information through sound waves. But machines that work with QR codes and sound-wave technology aren't widely available at large retail stores in China.
An alliance between Apple and Alibaba would encounter challenges, including how China's financial regulators might respond.
Alipay's expansion into offline payments as well as other financial services such as money-market funds has already met calls from traditional state-run Chinese banks for tighter regulation.
Apple has options for payment partners in China other than Alipay. One possibility would be an alliance with China UnionPay Co., a state-run credit card and debit-card monopoly that already has card readers across China that are compatible with the payment chips in Apple's new iPhones.
"For the short term, a deal with UnionPay would make sense [for Apple], whereas any alliance with Alipay could be more for future developments in the long run," said Chris Harvey, global leader of financial services at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd.

James Dimon won't like this.
Back in 2011, J.P. Morgan Chase and its chief relinquished the title of biggest U.S. bank by market value to Wells Fargo. Now comes a further indignity: J.P. Morgan's market value late last week was overtaken by Facebook's. This happened as the tech giant, which reports results Tuesday, issued new shares to fund its purchase of WhatsApp. Markets didn't ding Facebook for the dilution, so its value rose. It was worth $224 billion Monday versus about $221 billion for J.P. Morgan.
Facebook joins the ranks of tech stalwarts such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, all with market values bigger than J.P. Morgan's. Tech's dominance is really clear when you look at Apple: J.P. Morgan and Wells have a combined market value equal to only three-quarters that of the iPhone maker. No wonder graduates increasingly choose Silicon Valley over Wall Street these days.

LG-Samsung Rivalry Intensifies

Samsung Electronics Co. has been battling Apple Inc. in the cutthroat global smartphone market, but in its own backyard, the South Korean technology giant has been fighting off a half-century-old rival, LG Electronics Inc.
While it isn't yet a big material threat like low-cost Chinese makers, LG has been nibbling at Samsung's smartphone market share and is becoming a bigger player in a number of product categories, including TVs and home appliances, and gaining technological edge in key components like displays. The two keep very close tabs each other's product launch plans, according to people familiar with the matter.
To be sure, LG's gains are coming in Samsung's massive shadow. Samsung's revenue of 229 trillion won ($218 billion) for 2013 is nearly four times bigger than LG's 58 trillion won revenue for the same period, and Samsung's 30.5 trillion won net profit dwarfs LG's 223 billion won. In the second quarter, Samsung had a 25.2% share of the global smartphone market, while LG had 4.9%, according to researcher Strategy Analytics. Samsung remains a dominant force in terms of shipments for TVs and memory chips.
But when Samsung released its third-quarter earnings estimates earlier this month, its struggles in the smartphone market became ever more apparent. Samsung said its operating profit in the third quarter more than halved from a year earlier, largely due to weakness in its smartphone business. Its TV and display unit isn't expected to have done any better.
LG, which reports earnings on Wednesday, is expected to see its operating profit as much as double, according to analysts, thanks to a better-than-expected reception of the G3 smartphone it launched in May. In South Korea, LG grabbed a 27% handset market share in the third quarter, its highest in years, and up from just 18% a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. During the same period, Samsung's share slipped to 60% from 66%.
LG's display-making affiliate, LG Display Co., is poised to top its bigger rival Samsung Display Co. in both revenue and profit in the third quarter on solid sales of high-end screens used in Apple's iPhones as well as LG's flagship G series phones. Meanwhile, LG Display's growing expertise in large-size, next-generation displays has allowed LG Electronics to beat Samsung in the launch of a series of curved-screen and super-thin TV sets.
Still, in a sign that Samsung is becoming increasingly conscious of its much-smaller hometown rival, the company took a page from LG's playbook by introducing a rear-button function with its latest Galaxy Note 4 smartphone, which LG first introduced in its G2 smartphone last year.
LG didn't miss out on the rare opportunity to mock its bigger rival by tweeting through one of its official accounts: "Thank you 4 taking Note." Samsung declined to comment on the tweet.
For decades, the crosstown rivals have taken pride in pioneering technologies used in everything from TVs and refrigerators to washing machines and mobile devices. They compete in nearly identical global markets and product categories.
Their rivalry culminated in a bitter fight in September when LG executives entered an electronics shop in Berlin and allegedly broke the doors of multiple high-end Samsung washing machines. Samsung swiftly filed a formal complaint with the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, requesting an investigation. LG denied allegations of ill intent, saying the executives were casually "checking out" the doors when they unexpectedly broke. LG also took the occasion to highlight that it outsells Samsung in washing machines, one of the few categories where LG tops Samsung.
The incident is under investigation by the South Korean authorities. The prosecutors' office declined to comment on ongoing probes.
LG -- which began in 1958 as a company called Gold Star, a maker of radios -- has a history of falling behind Samsung in technological prowess. Its revenue was almost on par with that of Samsung, which was established in 1969, as a maker of black-and-white TVs, until the mid-1980s, when Samsung made a lucrative push into computers and semiconductors.
The gap widened after the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, when the government forced LG to divest its chip business as a part of a broad restructuring of the conglomerates known as chaebols. That chip business became SK Hynix Inc., the world's second-largest memory chip maker after Samsung.
When word was circulating last year that LG Electronics would introduce an "industry first" curved-screen smartphone in the fourth quarter, Samsung surprised the market at a media event in September 2013 with news of its own curved-screen phone. Samsung launched its Galaxy Round smartphone the following month exclusively in South Korea.
LG launched its LG G Flex in November, and rolled it out in global markets. Sales figures haven't been disclosed for either of the curved-screen phones.
Following LG's successful G3 phone launch this year, Samsung responded in September with a new phablet, dubbed the Galaxy Note Edge, with a screen that wraps over one edge to display messages.
"It comes down to what kind of benefits our product can provide to customers, because we can't earn money without customer satisfaction," said Chris Yie, vice president for marketing at LG's mobile unit. Mr. Yie said LG is preparing to counter Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge, without going into specific details.
The two companies appear to have selected their next battleground: A team of LG Display engineers is working to bring flexible screens that can fold in half for smartphones, while Samsung Display aims to start production at its flexible-display production line early next year.

Apple may or may not strike a partnership with Alibaba, but the iPhone maker has strong reasons for wanting to find new ways to grow its business in China.
During onstage interviews at the WSJD Live conference Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alibaba CEO Jack Ma threw out hints they would like to work together, possibly on something involving Alibaba¡¦s online payment service called Alipay. Theoretically, the service could work with Apple¡¦s Touch ID function embedded on the newest iPhones. But many questions remain, especially given Apple¡¦s drive to grow its own payment service.
What is clear is that the Chinese market grows more important for Apple with each passing year. Its annual securities filing, also out Monday, showed Greater China to be the fastest-growing of the company¡¦s geographic segments¡Xand the only one that grew its share of Apple¡¦s overall revenue in the 2014 fiscal year. China even grew sales of the iPad, which saw a decline in other markets.
Apple may not always play well with others. But with its eyes on China, it could be more motivated to make new friends.

Axelle Lemaire: Big U.S. Tech Companies Need to ¡¥Adapt¡¦; France¡¦s Digital Minister Says Europe Is Looking at Ways to Rein In ¡¥Les GAFAs¡¦; It¡¦s a ¡¥Tug of War,¡¦ Microsoft General Counsel Says

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. ¡V European governments are discussing how to update regulations for global tech titans as they grapple with the growing market share of a cadre of U.S.-based firms, said Axelle Lemaire, the French deputy minister for digital affairs.
During a discussion with Microsoft Corp. General Counsel Brad Smith at the WSJD Live global technology conference, Ms. Lemaire said France is exploring with Germany and other governments a variety of ways to rein in the market power of ¡§les GAFAs¡¨ ¡V a popular French acronym that refers to Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.
¡§If they really want to be international players, they have to adapt a little bit more,¡¨ said Ms. Lemaire.
The call for updated European rules is the latest from governments wary of a set of American tech superpowers, and worried that European firms are falling behind on their home turf. European officials in Brussels and other capitals have been putting unprecedented pressure on big tech firms such as Google Inc. and Apple Inc. over questions ranging from competition and privacy to taxes.
Earlier this month, Ms. Lemaire met with her counterparts in Berlin to discuss a joint position paper to be sent to other European governments in coming weeks. According to a person familiar with the matter, the position will include potential updates to competition regulations in Europe, in an effort to restore what the person called a ¡§level playing field.¡¨
Ms. Lemaire said traditional antitrust regulations are difficult to apply to companies such as Google, which offer content but don¡¦t operate traditional networks. ¡§They are not monopolies in the sense that their behavior doesn¡¦t result in an increase in prices,¡¨ she said.
Ms. Lemaire on Tuesday didn¡¦t give specifics on how France proposes to fix that problem, but said for instance that she would like Google ¡V which has a dominant share of Europe¡¦s web-search market -- to be more transparent about how its search algorithm works.
¡§We¡¦re trying to think to ways to ensure that the current European legislation can be respected,¡¨ said Ms. Lemaire. ¡§It is to ensure to the respect of the free share of the market and fair share of the burden of taxation.¡¨
¡§There is a tug of war going on,¡¨ responded Microsoft¡¦s Mr. Smith, adding that ¡§Like most tugs of war, I think people on each side probably need to learn more about where the other side is coming from.¡¨
One major source of tension were the revelations in 2013 of widespread spying by the U.S. National Security Agency, targeting both European citizens and governments. Those revelations have given new momentum to European Union politicians looking to tighten the bloc¡¦s privacy rules, and have hurt American companies¡¦ standing in Europe.
¡§It is something that has impacted our entire industry and we certainly have been impacted,¡¨ Mr. Smith said Tuesday.
Microsoft has taken a big role in pushing back against government surveillance requests, appealing for instance a U.S. court order to turn over customer email stored in a data center in Ireland. Mr. Smith rejected the suggestion that it might be a publicity stunt, arguing that letting the U.S. access data in another country could set a dangerous precedent.
¡§What is going to happen when we have 127 governments all doing this?¡¨ Mr. Smith asked.
Ms. Lemaire said European politicians are wary of imposing too many regulations, because because of what she said are American perceptions of hyper regulation in Europe. But she added that she believes some new rules, such as data protection rules, could help make Europe a more attractive place to do business, by offering greater protection for customers and companies.
¡§It would be too easy to see Europe as the over regulator and the U.S. as the free marketplace,¡¨ Ms. Lemaire said.

Xiaomi Defends Its Smartphone Business Model; Markets Chosen to Fit Low-Cost Approach, Hugo Barra Says

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.¡XChinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. said its international expansion plans are dictated by choosing markets where its low-cost business model will work well and not by avoiding areas of potential intellectual-property-litigation risk sweeping across the smartphone industry.
Speaking at the WSJD Live Global Technology Conference, Hugo Barra, Xiaomi¡¦s global vice president, said it looks for markets where the price of a smartphone constitutes a large part of a consumer¡¦s income. Those markets, Mr. Barra said, are where Xiaomi¡¦s model of selling smartphones at near cost works especially well.
Xiaomi passed Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. to become the best-selling smartphone provider in China in the second quarter, according to Canalys, a research firm. It has moved into India, Indonesia and other parts of Asia. Mr. Barra said the company is looking at a move into Brazil and Mexico next.
Xiaomi has taken the Chinese smartphone market by storm. It offers its phones at rock-bottom prices, often selling out new models online in minutes. It makes money by charging for services and accessories that accompany the phones. It also relies on a legion of loyal fans to test new features and drum up enthusiasm for the company.
But for all of Xiaomi¡¦s successes, rivals and critics have said the company would face patent infringements if it expanded to the U.S. or Europe because it doesn¡¦t have enough intellectual property to strike cross-licensing patent deals with other smartphone manufacturers.
¡§Our situation when it comes to patents is the same as everyone else,¡¨ said Mr. Barra, noting that his company files for a significant number of patents in China and strikes licensing deals abroad. Litigation risk ¡§is not a determining factor¡¨ in deciding the best markets for Xiaomi¡¦s international expansion, he said.
The issue came to prominence earlier this month when Jony Ive, Apple¡¦s senior vice president of design, was asked about Xiaomi and how some smartphone designs seem to resemble the iPhone. Without mentioning Xiaomi specifically, the usually soft-spoken Mr. Ive said it was ¡§theft¡¨ and called it ¡§lazy.¡¨
Mr. Barra said there is no such thing as a completely unique design language in the smartphone industry, noting that Apple¡¦s iPhone 6 takes a chapter from designs by Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp. He says that what Apple does is no different than what Xiaomi does. ¡§This idea of building upon great ideas and putting a twist on it is what we do,¡¨ he said.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
Xiaomi¡¦s smartphones run on a version of Google Inc.¡¦s Android operating system. Xiaomi is sometimes called ¡§the Apple of China¡¨ for the excitement it generates among consumers. Xiaomi sold about 18 million phones in the past year and it is forecasting sales of 60 million units this year.
The company poses a threat to other smartphone manufacturers because of its willingness to accept low margins on hardware to make money elsewhere. For example, Xiaomi¡¦s popular Redmi phone is about a quarter of the price of the iPhone 6, which sells for more than $800 in China.
¡§We fundamentally believe that innovation is not a luxury item. Innovation is for everyone,¡¨ said Mr. Barra. ¡§We fundamentally believe that when it costs you $200 to make something, you shouldn¡¦t sell it for $600.¡¨
Mr. Barra reiterated that the company has been moving data belonging to international users to servers outside China¡Xin Singapore and North America¡Xin an effort to assuage users¡¦ concerns about privacy. He said the decision to migrate servers outside of China was driven partially by a desire to improve performance by reducing network outages and latency, but he said users like to have data close.
¡§It makes people feel better that they have data next to them,¡¨ Mr. Barra said.
¡§Chinese companies are held to a higher standard than other companies out there.¡¨

Record Labels, Retailers Can¡¦t Agree on Which Day of the Week to Release New Music; Labels¡¦ Friday Push Hits Wrong Note With Retailers

Around the world, new music is released nearly eight days a week.
In the U.S., new tunes come out on Tuesdays, never mind that Britain does it on Mondays and Japan on Wednesdays.
But now, hoping to stem piracy and boost long-sagging sales, the world¡¦s biggest recording companies want retailers in various nations to stop marching to the beat of their own drums and start issuing new tunes on the same day: Friday.
¡§Do you ever hear people say, ¡¥Thank God it¡¦s Tuesday¡¦?¡¨ asked Frances Moore, chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the record labels¡¦ trade group in London, which has led the movement.
But many U.S. retailers, who say they weren¡¦t consulted about the plan, are outraged. Among other concerns, they worry that a Friday release day will create supply problems and hurt midweek business without necessarily boosting it over the weekend.
¡§Global release day? Great idea. Friday? A really crazy, poor idea,¡¨ said Mike Fratt, general manager and buyer at Homer¡¦s Music in Omaha, Neb., adding that he didn¡¦t appreciate the ¡§weird, kind of creepy, behind-the-scenes decision¡¨ being ¡§crammed down our throats.¡¨
¡§When did [the IFPI] become the government?¡¨ he added.
Ms. Moore said the IFPI is ¡§working through concerns¡¨ but added that ¡§someone¡¦s got to change.¡¨
In the pre-Internet era of CDs, the lack of global coordination didn¡¦t matter much. But when Apple Inc. opened the iTunes Music Store a decade ago, making downloads available in some countries before others depending on their national release days, some music fans started getting jealous¡Xand in many cases desperate, often scouring free or illegal music sites for the newest releases rather than patiently waiting for their country¡¦s turn.
The phenomenon reached a fever pitch last year when the French electronic act Daft Punk released its album, ¡§Random Access Memories,¡¨ after a prolonged marketing campaign that had die-hard fans biting their nails. The album was released first on a Friday in Germany, Australia, Sweden and other Friday-first nations. Within minutes, one record company executive said he saw piracy spike ¡§through the roof¡¨ in parts of the world where the album wasn¡¦t yet for sale. Meanwhile, his social media feed was flooded with furious complaints from fans who couldn¡¦t buy the album because of their location.
Soon, major-label executives¡Xwho had been discussing a global-release day for years¡Xdecided to act.
The idea was floated at an IFPI board meeting in Berlin earlier this year, with the goal of getting the world to switch to Fridays by July 2015. Ms. Moore, the IFPI¡¦s CEO, said Friday was the ¡§most compelling¡¨ choice because toward the end of the week, fans are more active on social media and more likely to make spontaneous purchases.
An IFPI-commissioned study predicts that global releases could drive more than a 3% increase in global sales, with a Friday or Saturday release day yielding the best results.
Global recorded-music revenue fell 4% last year to $15 billion, according to the IFPI.
Crispin Hunt, a member of the former Britpop band the Longpigs, said he was helping the IFPI rally support because he thought global Friday releases would bring back ¡§a sense of occasion¡¨ to music, which he said ¡§has become a utility like water and electricity¡¨ heard when ¡§you go into the public toilets.¡¨
¡§When things come out sporadically, people go, ¡¥Oh, yeah, I¡¦ve heard that¡¦ ¡¨ said Mr. Hunt. ¡§It stops being exciting.¡¨ As for the practical challenges facing countries making the switch, ¡§I¡¦m pretty sure the logistics industry will be able to deal with it,¡¨ he said.
But music retailers in the U.S. and the U.K. aren¡¦t convinced Friday releases will boost business, and they want more evidence.
¡§The obvious retort is, ¡¥Who says?¡¦ ¡¨ wrote Kim Bayley, the head of Britain¡¦s Entertainment Retailers Association, in a recent article published in a British music-industry newsletter.
Michael Kurtz, who launched an annual ¡§Record Store Day¡¨ six years ago to drum up business for record stores, said he found it ¡§odd¡¨ that ¡§no one wants to speak to us about it,¡¨ given the obvious similarities. Mr. Kurtz supports picking one global release day, but worries that Friday releases could lead to mayhem over the weekend in the event of shipping errors or unexpected demand for certain albums.
Of course, Record Store Day falls on a Saturday, but ¡§that¡¦s like throwing a party¡Xyou can¡¦t throw a party on a Wednesday, because no one¡¦s going to show up,¡¨ he said.
Few countries appear to have based their long-standing national release days on rigorous research. Until 2009, for example, Germany had released new music on Mondays, apparently because it was simply the beginning of the week, said the head of Germany¡¦s music industry association, Dieter Gorny. The nation switched to Fridays in 2009 because consumers seem on Friday to have a ¡§better attitude for jumping into this kind of fun,¡¨ he said, though German record sales have fallen 7% since then, anyway, mirroring similar declines in most other countries.
In the U.S., John Marmaduke, former head of the retail chain Hastings Entertainment, takes credit for ¡§New Release Tuesdays.¡¨ He said his company asked the record labels to create a firmer street date in the 1980s because, without one, business had been complicated. Since Tuesday was one of the slowest days of the week, he said, ¡§we could garner that day as our own.¡¨
Tuesday also provided a ¡§safety day,¡¨ if product didn¡¦t arrive Monday, as well as ample time to replenish supplies before the weekend.
Tuesday is now also the day DVDs, Blu-ray discs and books come out.
Japanese labels chose Wednesdays so they would have a few days to monitor sales and prepare retailers with adequate supply for the weekends¡Xand they haven¡¦t yet jumped officially on the Friday bandwagon, said a spokesman for Japan¡¦s record-industry trade group.
Australia has shifted its release day twice over the past seven years¡Xeventually to Friday¡Xbut after several attempts at analysis, it¡¦s still ¡§impossible to tell¡¨ whether the moves made any difference, said Ian Harvey, president of the Australian Music Retailers Association. He said Fridays just seemed most ¡§sensible¡¨ given some of the issues that had arisen on other days. Some Saturday staffers weren¡¦t unpacking the releases as fast as weekday workers, for example, while Thursday releases ended up feeling premature. However, Australia didn¡¦t experience any logistical nightmares, he said.
¡§I¡¦m surprised people are as agitated as they appear to be,¡¨ said Mr. Harvey.
Mr. Fratt, in Nebraska, says he is busy encouraging independent record labels to ¡§not abide¡¨ if the street day is moved to Friday. ¡§Maybe we can derail this train,¡¨ he said.

Greetings from Laguna Beach,
Here¡¦s an update on our WSJD Live technology conference:
Today Andrew Conrad, head of the Life Sciences team at the Google X research lab, revealed that Google is designing tiny magnetic particles to patrol the human body for signs of cancer and other diseases¡Xthe latest example of the company¡¦s sweeping ambition. The project, however, still appears to be more than five years from fruition. We also heard from Xiaomi¡¦s global vice president, Hugo Barra, who defended the Chinese smartphone marker¡¦s business model which focuses on markets where the price of a smartphone constitutes a large part of a consumer¡¦s income. Axelle Lemaire, France¡¦s deputy minister for digital affairs, talked about the regulation of personal data, noting that European governments are discussing how to update rules for global tech titans. ¡§If they really want to be international players, they have to adapt a little bit more,¡¨ she said. FireEye¡¦s Kevin Mandia discussed tactics used in security breaches. Coursera CEO Richard Levin and Gene Block, the chancellor of the University of California in Los Angeles, explored the impact of massive open online courses, or MOOCs. And venture investor Marc Andreessen offered his thoughts on startup valuations and what needs to be done to make the technology industry more inclusive of women.
In case you missed it, yesterday Alibaba¡¦s Jack Ma shared his interest in partnering with Apple in financial payments, and Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was going to meet with Mr. Ma this week to discuss the prospect. Today we look at the potential benefits and pitfalls of such an alliance, noting a host of technical and possible regulatory hurdles. During the conference, Mr. Cook also gave us an update on the recent launch of Apple Pay, a service that will help users of the latest model iPhones pay for items in stores or in mobile apps. In a review of Apple Pay, our personal technology columnist Geoffrey Fowler writes that the service beats PayPal and Google, but needs more reach before we can eradicate wallet bloat. And don¡¦t miss tomorrow¡¦s coverage of WSJD Live, which you can follow here. I will be interviewing News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Telefonos de Mexico chief Carlos Slim on the bets they¡¦ve won and lost. We will also hear the perspectives of other entrepreneurs, executives and innovators, including Sue Desmond-Hellmann, James Cameron and Steve Ballmer.

Popular Software Gives Hackers Easy Targets, DOD Official Says; Widespread Use of Microsoft Word, Apple OS X Is Endangering Us All, Dan Kaufman Says

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.¡XThe ubiquity of a handful of computer programs, such as Microsoft Corp.¡¦s Word or Apple Inc.¡¦s OSX operating system, is endangering us all, a Defense Department official said Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal¡¦s WSJD Live Global Technology Conference.
Dan Kaufman, head of innovation at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, said the widespread use of such programs gives hackers an easy way to target scores of people with one security hole.
¡§Cybersecurity today is just fundamentally broken,¡¨ Mr. Kaufman said, ¡§deeply and fundamentally broken.¡¨
Hackers find their way into machines¡Xboth classified networks and retailers¡Xby searching for unnoticed flaws in the software these networks use. After an initial incident, it can take weeks or years for other companies to patch their systems to prevent a similar incident using the software hole exploited in the original attack.
That gives hackers a big window to reuse the same cyberweapon.
The Defense Department official was joined on stage by Kevin Mandia, chief operating officer at FireEye Inc., which on Tuesday released a detailed report on a Russian cyberspying campaign that has relied on the same set of tools since 2007.
If Mr. Kaufman had his way, programs such as Microsoft Word or Apple¡¦s OSX would change continually, making it harder for hackers to exploit the same flaws repeatedly.
Mr. Kaufman¡¦s dream, however, could be a way off, because a constantly changing program would consume a computer¡¦s resources, slowing other tasks. Users ¡§won¡¦t put up with that,¡¨ he said.

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT:
U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday, with the Dow closing above 17000, as riskier corners of the market led benchmarks higher. Treasurys settled lower after an upbeat consumer report sapped demand for haven assets. Oil prices edged higher as the dollar fell. Gold ended flat ahead of the FOMC decision.
OPENING CALL:
On a quiet day for Asian data, Wednesday brings Japan¡¦s September preliminary industrial production figures. Economists see a rebound from an August slump. But Japanese industry has a long way to go if it is to shake off the shackles of domestic deflation and the lost production brought on by an exodus of manufacturers to more affordable production locations.
EQUITIES:
U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday, continuing a rebound from an early-October swoon and leaving the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq with gains for the month.
Fueling the bounce has been renewed confidence in the U.S. economy and corporate earnings, even as the Federal Reserve is expected to announce Wednesday it is ending the bond purchases it has been using to ease monetary policy. On Tuesday, stock prices gained with help from an unexpected jump in consumer confidence to its highest level since 2007. That encouraged investors to move back into areas that are seen as riskier, traders said, after they had fled some of those sectors during steep stock-market declines earlier this month. Small-cap stocks, energy shares and technology stocks posted the strongest gains, and safe-haven investments such as Treasurys declined.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index led major benchmarks, gaining 78.36 points, or 1.7%, to 4564.29. The index is up 1.6% in October.
The S&P 500 added 23.42 points, or 1.2%, to 1985.05 on Tuesday; it has gained 0.6% in October. The Russell 2000 Index, a small-stock benchmark, rallied 31.98 points, or 2.9%, to 1149.45.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 187.81 points, or 1.1%, to 17005.75. It remains slightly lower for the month, down 0.2%.
October initially looked like it would be a tough month for stock-market bulls, as global benchmarks fell on worries about economic growth. At stocks¡¦ latest closing lows on Oct. 15, the Dow had shed 5.3% for the month and was down 6.6% from its all-time high. The S&P 500 had a 5.6% loss and was 7.4% off its September record high. The Nasdaq had lost 6.2% and was trading 8.3% below its 2014 high.
But since then, stocks have largely recovered, as companies have posted better third-quarter results than expected, and some economic reports have been better than anticipated. The S&P 500 and Dow are now less than 2% below their all-time highs from mid-September.
¡§We thought the selloff was unfounded, and now people are buying into the notion that it wasn¡¦t based on any change in the fundamentals,¡¨ said David Lefkowitz, equity strategist with UBS Wealth Management. ¡§It¡¦s very good for the stock market.¡¨
In corporate news, Twitter sank 9.8% after it said Monday it added 13 million monthly active users in the third quarter, up 4.8%. That is a slower pace than the 6.3% added in the previous quarter. The slowing user growth overshadowed Twitter¡¦s revenue, which more than doubled in the quarter and prompted an increase in full-year guidance.
Markets in China outperformed their regional peers Tuesday with a gauge of Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms rallying its most in two months, while investors in other parts of Asia pulled back ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
FOREX:
The dollar wobbled against its rivals following mixed U.S. economic data as investors tried to guess the Federal Reserve¡¦s next move.
The dollar had dropped early Tuesday after a measure of U.S. manufacturing fell for a second consecutive month, suggesting growth may have slowed in the third quarter and interest rates may stay low for longer.
The greenback later pared some of its losses against the euro and made gains against the Japanese yen after a rise in consumer confidence this month pointed to an improved short-term view on business and employment conditions in the U.S.
The euro rose 0.3% to $1.2734, its highest level in almost a week, while the pound climbed 0.1% to $1.6133. The dollar rose 0.3% versus the yen to Y108.16.
¡§If growth is lower than the Fed expects, the Fed probably will delay hiking,¡¨ said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at BNP Paribas. ¡§This gives the market more reason to be cautious ahead of the Fed [decision] tomorrow, and scale back some of its dollar [long positions].¡¨
BONDS:
Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds pulled back, as an upbeat consumer confidence report and a rise in U.S. stock prices sapped demand for haven assets.
The bond retreat came as the Federal Reserve started its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and is scheduled to release an interest-rate statement Wednesday afternoon.
In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 8/32 lower, yielding 2.284%. Yields rise as prices fall. The yield was 3% at the start of the year.
The monthly gauge of U.S. consumer sentiment jumped to 94.5 this month from 89 in September. The report suggested U.S. consumers remain upbeat over the economy despite the recent market turmoil and struggling growth in the euro zone. It overshadowed another release Tuesday showing purchases of durable goods, a gauge of business spending, fell by 1.3% in September.
¡§Higher stocks, new debt supply, and a very strong consumer confidence number sent bond yields higher,¡¨ said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of trading in Seattle at D.A. Davidson & Co.
COMMODITIES:
Oil prices edged higher as the dollar fell and conflicting U.S. economic data kept markets in a holding pattern.
Light, sweet crude for December delivery rose 42 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $81.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The global Brent contract rose 20 cents, or 0.2%, to $86.03 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Nymex crude held up for a second day after dipping below $80 a barrel on Monday, with some analysts saying they believe the tailspin that has dragged U.S. and global oil prices down by about 25% since mid-June appears to be over for now.
¡§All in all, I¡¦m in the camp that we¡¦re at or near the bottom in crude oil,¡¨ said Stephen Schork, an analyst and editor of industry trade publication the Schork Report.
Gold prices closed nearly unchanged as investors cautiously awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve¡¦s policy-setting meeting, while palladium futures rose on hopes of improved industrial demand.

In China, high demand for robots but too many robot manufacturers

* Automation seen as solution to sliding Chinese productivity
* Central, local governments rolling out policy support, incentives
* Over 400 robot makers, 30 industrial parks for robotics
By Pete Sweeney
SHANGHAI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - China wants domestic companies to buy more locally made robots to lift productivity, but industry insiders have warned its policies are over-stimulating the market and that robot manufacturers were "coming up like mushrooms."
Government officials, worried that productivity growth may have turned negative since 2009, see the promotion of automation as a policy that will increase efficiency. Chinese manufacturers, struggling with increasing costs of labour, also favour more use of robots where possible.
The confluence of policy support and market demand made China the world's biggest buyer of robots in 2013, overtaking Japan.
At the same time, both central and local governments are encouraging new domestic players to capture market share from established foreign brands. In its five-year economic plan for 2011-2015, Beijing specifically targeted robotics as a key sector for development, hoping to create four or five domestic robotics "champion" firms to meet an annual production target of about 13,000 robots.
But Stefan Sack, CEO of robot manufacturer Comau Shanghai Engineering, warned that the government policies carried a risk.
"Government intervention can help industry to grow but it can also create bubbles," he said at a robotics industry conference, adding that small manufacturers in the sector were "coming up like mushrooms".
"Everybody wants to become a robot manufacturer now because it's sexy," Sack said.
The official Xinhua news agency reported on Monday that China now has 420 robot companies, adding that more than 30 industrial parks devoted to robotics were being built or were already functioning around the country.
Beijing's industrial policies have a history of going astray, most recently in renewable energy, where official endorsement of what was seen as a cutting edge technology resulted in duplicated investment around the country, ending in a wave of bad debt as profit margins were wiped out.
EARLY SIGNS
Although analysts said the robotics industry is not at that stage, there are already early warning signs.
"China's market is totally fragmented; you've basically got 31 provincial markets," said Andrew Polk, resident economist at the Conference Board research house in Beijing. "You get a directive on the central front to build robots or whatever, and everyone moves to create their own local champions."
"They are doing this at a point where wages are rising, but their comparative advantage is still relatively cheap labour," he added. "They could be pushing this too hard too early."
According to the China Robot Industry Alliance, about 37,000 robots were sold in China in 2013, almost three-fourths of them manufactured overseas.
The number of domestically produced industrial robots tripled to about 10,000 units, on track to meet Beijing's goal of having domestic brands account for a third of sales by 2015.
Official media said that by mid-summer, 54 listed Chinese companies had invested in robotics firms, of which 80 percent were first-time investors, causing the number of robot stocks to nearly triple since July 2012.
The mergers have been welcomed by mainland investors: when JS Corrugating Machinery Co Ltd said it would acquire a robotics firm in June, its stock spiked by 60 percent in a few trading days.
Established players are also doing well. Shanghai Siasun Robotics & Automation, one of China's best-known robot makers, is up over 50 percent this year and pricing at around 84 times earnings, far outperforming benchmarks.
GENUINE PROBLEM
Few economists dispute that the export powerhouse provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong, China's main manufacturing hubs, are facing a genuine problem.
"Zhejiang province is facing a worker shortage. We have new constraints on resources, input factors, and the environment; we need to adjust our economy's structure," said Zhou Tufa, division chief at the province's industrial investment department.
"We hope to substitute machines for labourers doing heavy physical work," he said in an interview in the provincial capital Hangzhou.
Local governments have adopted a variety of different stimulus tactics in robotics. Dongguan, a manufacturing centre in Guangdong, has been particularly aggressive, creating a 200 million yuan ($33 million) investment fund to subsidise robotics investments by local firms.
Wang Dayong, president of Zhejiang Sanhua Automotive Components, told Reuters that his major challenge is attracting and retaining workers, a problem he hopes robots can solve.
"We are automating for long-term competitiveness," he said.
But customers warned that demand for more robots does not equate to demand for more robot suppliers.
Frank Chuang, assistant director of manufacturing operations at Ford Greater China, said that since most robot manufacturers use customised operating systems and components, his company is conservative regarding suppliers.
"If we don't carefully select the robots, then in the near future we will generate not just programming language issues but also maintenance issues."
It is also possible that firm owners are over-estimating the potential benefits of automation.
For example Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple , said in 2011 that it aimed to have one million robotic arms in operation by 2014. It subsequently scaled back its plans, with managers saying the robots were not able to replace humans as effectively as expected.
Even automation enthusiasts like Wang of Zhejiang Sanhua are careful.
"There are still areas where robots aren't as good as people," he said. "Excessive automation carries its own risks."

GT Advanced Says It Can¡¦t Afford to Fight Apple, Must Settle; Screen-Material Supplier Said ¡§Litigation...Would Be Challenging and Expensive¡¨

GT Advanced Technologies Inc. said it needs to settle disputes with Apple Inc. because ¡§protracted litigation against one of the largest corporations in the world with over $100 billion of cash would be challenging and expensive.¡¨
Jilted by Apple as a supplier of sapphire screen material for iPhones, GT Advanced filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this month and moved to put under seal the explanation of what went wrong between the two companies.
Papers filed near midnight Monday say Apple is threatening to crush the small, distressed company with ¡§numerous liquidated damages provisions in the Apple Agreements pursuant to which Apple would likely assert millions, if not billions, of dollars in secured and unsecured claims against certain of the Debtors,¡¨ lawyers for GT Advanced wrote.
Apple, which signed the pact, didn¡¦t respond Tuesday to questions about the settlement.
Court filings spell out why GT Advanced, less than a month into a bankruptcy that shocked shareholders and creditors, decided to cut a deal with Apple, which financed its entry into the sapphire material making industry but declined to use the company¡¦s products when the new iPhones rolled out.
In a supplemental filing Tuesday, GT Advanced revealed it spent $900 million trying to produce ¡§sapphire in quantities, size and quality never before achieved,¡¨ to Apple¡¦s specifications. Apple financed less than half the cost of GT Advanced¡¦s failed attempt to make ¡§a product that Apple would accept,¡¨ court papers say.
Besides borrowing from Apple as it moved to transform its business, GT Advanced borrowed $214 million by issuing notes in 2013 and raised $71 million by selling stock, court papers say.
Unable to negotiate changes to the Apple agreements, GT Advanced found it ¡§would never realize a profit.¡¨ The Apple venture that was to have been ¡§revolutionary for GTAT¡¦s business,¡¨ instead plunged the company into a liquidity crisis with mounting losses ahead, court papers say.
Bankruptcy will allow GT Advanced to end its relationship with Apple and free the company to get back into the business of selling sapphire furnaces to other producers of electronic consumer products, according to a declaration from Daniel Squiller, GT Advanced¡¦s chief operating officer.
GT Advanced believes it could win disputes with Apple and may have ¡§various causes of action against Apple, including actions rooted in the Bankruptcy Code and breach of contract claims.¡¨ The cost of standing up to Apple in court would be too much for the New Hampshire-based company, court papers say.
Attorneys for the official committee of unsecured creditors haven¡¦t responded to questions about whether they are going to support the settlement. Creditors¡¦ lawyers also didn¡¦t respond when asked whether they are conducting an independent probe of the chances of suing Apple.
The settlement gives GT Advanced years to sell the sapphire-manufacturing furnaces to raise money to pay off the Apple debt.
Before agreeing to the settlement, GT Advanced moved to reject the agreements with Apple that contained the liquidated damages provisions. It won approval to shut down sapphire manufacturing operations at the Arizona facility and one in Massachusetts. If a bankruptcy judge approves the settlement, the contract rejection motion will be ¡§moot,¡¨ lawyers for GT Advanced wrote.
GT Advanced doesn¡¦t have a bankruptcy loan but expects to have one ¡§in several weeks,¡¨ court papers say.
The agreement hangs on getting a court order that orders the destruction of all copies of papers GT Advanced filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Hampshire which explain the trouble between the sapphire supplier and Apple, and the reasons for the bankruptcy.
Dow Jones & Co, publisher of The Wall Street Journal; U.S. Trustee William Harrington, a Justice Department lawyer charged with monitoring the bankruptcy courts, and New Hampshire Attorney General Joseph Foster have challenged the secrecy in the case as illegal.

T-Mobile forecasts slower subscriber growth in 4th quarter

WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc warned on Tuesday that its torrid growth rate in subscribers fueled by aggressive promotions would slow in the fourth quarter along with billings per customer.
The cellular provider expects to add 700,000 to 1.1 million contract subscribers in the quarter ending Dec. 31, compared with 1.4 million in the third quarter, the company told investors in a call.
T-Mobile, which is controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekcom , also said it expects a 2.5 percent dip in average revenue per user (ARPU).
T-Mobile, the fourth-largest U.S. carrier by number of subscribers, has attracted a wave of customers through discounts and campaigns that eliminated contracts and cut prices. But the rise in customers on promotional plans has weighed on margins.
"It is the nature of any customer acquisition-driven business that the faster you grow the more pressure it will put on profitability. You can't lose sight of the underlying economics," said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.
On Monday T-Mobile announced the highest average billings per contract customer in the company's history along with high service revenue growth. Still, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization was flat year-over-year.
"We are very optimistic about the increase in ARPU going into next year," Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter told investors. "We saw more of a promotional impact on Q4 than Q3," he said.
T-Mobile shares were up 1 percent to $28.28.
The telecoms operator expects to tackle renewed holiday competition in the fourth quarter by focusing on devices such as Apple Inc's iPhone, Chief Executive Officer John Legere told analysts.
"In this period of device change, I think that is a fascinating ground for us," he said, adding that the company will look to snag upwards of 17 million AT&T iPhone customers whose contracts are expiring.
"The possibilities for us and the challenges for them seem to be connected," Legere said of AT&T.
T-Mobile is for now going it alone after a series of potential deals were thwarted by regulatory and other issues. Still, Legere did not rule out potential partnerships in the future.
"You have got to think creatively about this industry. When you do, you will realize T-Mobile is a natural ally to other players trying to get into the United States," he said.
In recent months, rumors have emerged that America Movil , Latin America's biggest telecommunications company could be a potential buyer.
T-Mobile is under pressure to come up with the billions of dollars it will need to spend in an upcoming spectrum auction to get the lower-range frequencies it needs to better compete with rivals Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T.
America Movil's chief executive said earlier this week that the company is "not talking with anybody at this stage." (Reporting by Marina Lopes; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)

(The Day Ahead is an email and PDF publication that includes the day's major stories and events, analyses and other features. To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) The Federal Reserve wraps up a two-day meeting that appears certain to end with an announcement that the U.S. central bank's bond-buying stimulus is coming to a close. Less certain is what Fed officials might say about the outlook for the economy and inflation, given an uncertain global backdrop that has led investors to reappraise when the central bank will be able to finally raise interest rates. Visa Inc, the world's largest credit and debit card company, is expected to report a fourth-quarter profit, helped by higher spending by customers using its cards. The company is looking to capitalize on the growing mobile payment business, as it has been gaining traction among businesses and consumers alike.
Visa, which partnered with Apple for its Apple Pay service, also launched online offerings like Visa Checkout and Visa Token. Visa lowered its full-year revenue forecast in July, citing slow growth in cross-border transactions. Global investment bank Deutsche Bank AG reports third-quarter results. Investment banking roared back to life in the quarter, but costs for fines and settlements are likely to have hit Germany's top lender hard. Barrick Gold Corp, the world's biggest gold producer, is expected to report lower third-quarter results on a weaker gold price and a fall in gold production after the sale of some of its higher-cost gold mines. The market's focus is likely to be on the way forward for Barrick following a number of key executive changes, including the elimination of its chief executive position. There will also likely be questions about Barrick's assertion that a higher royalty rate in Zambia could threaten the economic viability of its Lumwana copper mine. Canadian miners Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd and Yamana Gold Inc are expected to report third-quarter earnings. The market will likely be looking for updated commentary on Agnico's outlook for 2015, news on expansions at the Goldex and Kittila mines and any further scope for acquisitions following the purchase of Mexico-focused miner Cayden. Yamana's results are expected to be relatively low key, after the company announced preliminary production results earlier in the month that were in line with expectations. World's second-biggest uranium miner Cameco Corp reports third-quarter results, following a challenging period. Canada's biggest diversified metals company, Teck Resources Ltd, is expected to report lower third-quarter earnings on weaker coal and base metals prices, with the market's focus on the impact of China's recent decision to reimpose import tariffs on metallurgical and thermal coal. French oil company Total SA reports third-quarter results. The impact of the sharp drop in oil prices since June should start hurting, although a drop in the euro could temper that somewhat. Whiting Petroleum Corp, on the verge of buying Kodiak Oil & Gas to become North Dakota's largest oil producer, is expected to post a spike in third-quarter profit thanks to increased drilling. U.S. health insurer WellPoint Inc is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit. The company, which operates Blue CrossBlue Shield plans in 14 states, will also be expected to give a pulse check on Obamacare. Life insurer MetLife Inc is expected to report a rise in third-quarter profit, helped by derivative gains linked to credit spreads. The company, heavily exposed to persistently low U.S. interest rates, has a large derivatives program designed to reduce that risk. Last month, the Financial Stability Oversight Council proposed to designate the insurer as "systemically important," which could subject it to stricter oversight by the U.S. Federal Reserve. MetLife, which has vehemently opposed the proposal, has decided to contest the decision. Allstate Corp's estimated pre-tax catastrophe loss for the third quarter is expected to be about $517 million, down significantly from $936 million in the preceding quarter. The largest listed U.S. home and auto insurer has been raising insurance rates in its home insurance business to offset catastrophe losses and low interest rates on its investments. Chief Executive Thomas Wilson said Allstate's focus this year would be to attract customers to boost its market share rather than go for "abnormally large" price increases. Department chain operator Kohl's Corp's leadership team will host an investor conference to present their "multi-year growth" plans. Kohl's had said it expects third-quarter comparable sales to decrease 1.4 percent, hurt by weak demand for women's apparel. The company also said its 2014 earnings would be at the low end of its prior forecast of $4.05-$4.45 per share and that sales remained softer through October. Hershey Co, which makes Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, is likely to report a third-quarter profit above analysts' average expectations, according to StarMine. Investors will be looking for indications on how the price increase has impacted sales, particularly as rival Mondelez International had to cut 2014 sales targets in August after price hikes to cover commodity costs sparked a backlash by consumers and retailers in some European markets. After a slide in its shares this year, Eaton Corp will try to win back investors when it reports third-quarter results. The manufacturer of power systems and products has faced concerns about its markets and disappointed some investors when it signaled earlier this year that it would not spin off its vehicle business, as some on Wall Street had hoped. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co's results have been pressured this year, first from a severe U.S. winter that hurt auto demand and then by lower sales of its high-margin tires to automakers. The company has also sold fewer tires in Latin America, which has been hurt by lower vehicle production in Brazil and economic turmoil in Venezuela. These trends have also pinched rivals Bridgestone Corp and Michelin. Goodyear is the first of the group to report third-quarter results and investors will be watching for commentary on global auto production going into next year. SunPower Corp, the second-largest solar panel maker in the United States, is expected to report a lower third-quarter profit. Uneven revenue recognition from solar projects has been weighing on the company's results. The company is now diversifying into installation of solar panels on rooftops, a market dominated by SolarCity. Investors will look to see if SunPower will continue to lease out panels to customers, or adopt other financing methods. Also of interest to investors will be the formation of a yield co. Akamai Technologies Inc, whose networks help improve the quality and speed of content delivery, is likely to report third-quarter revenue above the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine. Akamai is benefiting from higher consumption of online video and streaming music and the company had forecast current-quarter profit and revenue largely above estimates. However, higher spending on sales, marketing and research and development may impact profit as the company is investing more on developing higher margin services to compete with rivals. Network equipment makers JDS Uniphase Corp and F5 Networks Inc are scheduled to report first-quarter and fourth-quarter results, respectively. JDS Uniphase's profit is expected to beat the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine data. F5 Networks is also expected to report results slightly above the average a

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - GT Advanced Technology Inc , which struck an agreement with erstwhile partner Apple Inc last week that allowed it to proceed with its bankruptcy, said the iPhone maker had threatened to seek damages of more than $1 billion against the company.
Former stock market darling GT Advanced, once set to become the main supplier of scratch-resistant sapphire to Apple, surprised markets when it filed for Chapter 11 earlier this month. It failed to meet performance targets set out in its supply agreement with Apple, setting the stage for its failure, according to court filings.
GT Advanced said in a court filing late on Monday that it needed to settle with the iPhone maker to avert a costly legal battle it might not win.
"The alternative to the settlement agreement would be months, if not years, of costly, time-consuming, and distracting litigation with Apple over a wide range of contested issues, the success of which GTAT could not guarantee," the company said in a court filing late on Monday.
"Apple has advised GTAT that it would assert liquidated damages claims for in excess of $1 billion against GTAT," according to the filing. Liquidated damages are awarded when a party to a contract fails to perform as promised.
Apple, which has more than $100 billion in cash, was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by San Francisco newsroom; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)

WSJ.D Technology: Apples Surprising Driver: the Mac --- Computer Line's Unit Sales Up 21% And Revenue Tops That of the iPad

During a quarter marked by frenzied demand for the latest iPhones, Apple Inc. logged its biggest sales gains with a product heading into middle-age: the Mac.
On the 30th anniversary of the first Macintosh, a 21% jump in unit sales helped Apple's computer line leapfrog the sagging iPad to become the company's second biggest-selling product line in revenue terms, just behind the iPhone.
The Mac line generated revenue of $6.625 billion in the quarter, more than iPad revenue of $5.316 billion.
Demand for Macs rose amid falling sales of Windows PCs, giving Apple more than 6% of the global PC market, according to the research firm IDC. That percentage is Apple's highest market share since 1995, when Microsoft Corp. established its dominance over the computer market with Windows 95. The Mac gained market share in 33 of the last 34 quarters, lifting its share from 2.1% in 2006, according to IDC.
Several factors have contributed to the Mac's steady rise in the last eight years: a halo effect conferred by popular Apple devices like the iPhone and iPad; a decision to stop charging for updates of Mac operating software; high visibility through the company's own retail stores; and Apple's introduction of innovative designs like the MacBook Air at lower prices than the company usually charges.
Apple also has benefited recently from its relatively greater popularity in developed markets like the U.S. and Western Europe, where consumer demand for PCs has been relatively steady.
Macs, of course, cost considerably more than tablets, so in unit terms tablets still outsell Macs. For the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, Apple sold 39.27 million iPhones, 12.32 million iPads, and 5.52 million Macs.
Macs remain niche products. Apple laptops, even after price cuts to two models this year, on average sell for nearly three times the price of a Windows-based notebook, according to retail-store data from market-research firm NPD Group.
Some customers find Apple's products worth the extra expense. Ali Mirza, a 21-year-old law student at the University of Edinburgh, said he bought a Lenovo Y500 laptop last year after years of owning a Mac. He thought the Lenovo would provide better value because it had higher specifications at a cheaper price. But as problems with his computer piled up, Mr. Mirza decided to go back to a Mac. He purchased a 13-inch MacBook Pro last week.
"A computer is more than the sum of its parts," said Mr. Mirza. "I could get a cheaper computer, but I probably wouldn't get the same value out of it as I would out of a Mac."
Apple's popularity in other sorts of devices has given the Mac a boost. The iPhone, in particular, has breathed new life into the Mac by serving as a gateway for customers who wouldn't otherwise have considered buying an Apple computer.
"If somebody has a great experience with an Apple product the first time, they are much more likely to buy another Apple product," said Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, noting that "a very large number" of first-time Mac owners purchased the computer after buying an iPhone.
Apple is trying to lure more iPhone users to the Mac by linking smartphone features to the computer. The company recently added so-called continuity features that help Apple devices to work better together. For example, a user can start writing an email on an iPhone and continue writing it on a Mac, switching freely between the two devices.
IPhones generated $23.7 billion in revenue for the quarter.
Apple started to gain market share in 2006 with its launch of MacBook laptops, which had a starting price that was more affordable than its earlier laptops.
Apple also had a hit with its MacBook Air laptop, which went on sale in 2008 and introduced a new category of computers with slim profiles and improved battery life that Windows PC makers have sought to copy.
Price cuts have reduced the MacBook Air's starting price to $899, more within reach of Windows buyers. Computers in the MacBook Air's category are the only part of the PC market expected to grow this year and in 2015, according to research firm Gartner Inc.
The company also benefits from heavy traffic in Apple stores where prospective customers can try new Macs.
Last year, Apple stopped charging for updates of its Mac OS X operating system, a change that may prod shoppers wondering whether to buy immediately or wait for fresh features in the next version.
For the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, Apple sold 39.27 million iPhones, 12.32 million iPads, and 5.52 million Macs.
Gaining further market share won't be easy for Macs, particularly now that Microsoft and its PC allies have begun to regain their footing after a historically awful 2013, when total PC sales (including Macs) fell 10%. World-wide sales were down only 1.7% in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with a year earlier, IDC said.
Moreover, the biggest Windows PC vendors are making sales that, in prior years, might have gone to tablets, including iPads. In the past year, the PC market has gotten a helping hand from new types of Windows computing devices such as so-called convertibles that work as both laptop and tablet.
Convertibles may be tempting people who wouldn't have bought a PC at all. In surveys of thousands of people who bought higher-end convertible PCs, 48% said they chose the new device over a tablet, according to the research backed by Intel Corp., which makes the computer chips used in nearly all PCs as well as Macs.
In the PC market, "It's not as boring as it was a couple of years ago," said NPD Group analyst Stephen Baker. "There's a little more choice."
Apple's competitors also have opened new fronts in pricing. Microsoft last spring started charging PC makers a cut-rate price for a type of Windows software, making it possible for manufacturers to offer PCs for less than $200.
Such rock-bottom prices helped expand the pool of PC buyers who might otherwise have purchased either a tablet, a Chromebook (a stripped-down laptop powered by operating software from Google Inc.), or no computing device at all, according to analysts and industry executives.

Twitter Slammed by Slow User Growth

One year after its initial public offering, Twitter Inc. is still having a hard time convincing investors to look beyond one touchy metric: user growth.
The social-media company reported Monday that revenue once again more than doubled in the third quarter to $361 million, surpassing expectations and causing it to raise guidance for the full year.
But Twitter's user growth -- the percentage change in the number of users who log in at least once a month -- slowed again after gaining momentum in recent quarters, reigniting concerns the service is having trouble keeping up with the growth of larger rival Facebook Inc.
Twitter's shares sank about 10% in after-hours trading on Monday to $43.65, shaving off roughly $3 billion in market value to about $26.9 billion. The drop washes out some of the stock advances from three months ago, when Twitter reported strong second-quarter results across the board and investors sent shares surging 29%.
The issue for the San Francisco company lies in convincing investors it is bigger than what it appears to be, as Wall Street remains stubbornly focused on user gains over moneymaking. The more users that sign up and spend time on Twitter, the more potential for targeted advertising, Twitter's main revenue source.
On Monday, Twitter said it added 13 million monthly active users in the three months through September, up 4.8%, reaching 284 million users world-wide. While in line with some analysts' expectations, it is a slower pace than the 6.3% it added in the previous quarter.
"We had another very strong quarter financially," said Chief Executive Dick Costolo during an earnings call with analysts. "I'm happy with the strategies and the quality of the work we're doing but given our significant aspirations and the breadth of the opportunity in front of us, it's more critical than ever that we increase our overall pace of execution."
Increasing user numbers as well as engagement has been a top priority for Twitter ever since it went public in November, after which investors knocked the company for showing signs that its size may have peaked.
Since then, the company has focused on making the service simpler to use for members beyond the early adopters. At the same time, Twitter executives have spoken out about Twitter's reach beyond core users amid the inevitable comparisons with Facebook, which has more than four times the active users at about 1.32 billion.
On Monday's call, Mr. Costolo attempted to explain Twitter's total audience "as a series of geometrically eccentric circles." In short, he said, there are three audience groups: the core users; those who visit the site but don't log in; and those who see Twitter content embedded on other sites across different screens, known as the syndicated audience.
Twitter's primary focus in recent quarters has been to improve the experience across all of these groups.
This quarter it rolled out a redesigned sign-up process to get new users up to speed faster by getting them to follow voices they would find interesting sooner. Mr. Costolo said a new user profile design on Apple's iOS system has increased interaction among the logged-out audience.
The latest quarter didn't have a big event such as World Cup soccer games to help drive usage. Twitter executives had credited the soccer tournament for encouraging users to check the service for scores. On the call with analysts, Twitter financial chief Anthony Noto said international growth also suffered from not having other big events such as the elections in India. And he cited "authentication issues" in Asia that cost the service one to two million users.
At the same time, it is becoming less clear how "engaged" users are on the site. This is emblematic of Twitter's growing pains as "timeline views," the company's own measure of user activity, has become less relevant amid the slew of product changes. Twitter said "timeline views," counted each time a user refreshes a page on desktop or mobile device, reached 181 billion, an increase of 14% from a year earlier and 4.6% from the second quarter.
But timeline views per monthly active user declined 7% to 636 views per monthly active user compared with a year earlier.
Evercore analyst Ken Sena said the metric increasingly doesn't reflect other forms of engagement, such as shared tweets, visits to profile pages or when a user listens to an audio track.
"I don't blame anyone who relies upon those metrics," said Chris Sacca, a venture capitalist and longtime Twitter investor, referring to user growth and timeline views. "But, the long-term story will show that they aren't good measures."
Twitter has yet to turn a profit, and posted a loss of $175.5 million in the latest quarter, as it continues to build out its business and compensate newly hired engineers.
The company projected fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million and raised its full-year projection to as much as $1.38 billion.

REFILE--Former Google exec's app aims to tackle chronic illness

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Having difficulty managing chronic disease? Now there's an app for that.
Vida, a new startup founded by Google Inc's former commerce chief, aims to help patients get healthy, reduce stress levels and lose weight through online "health coaches."
Many mobile health apps focus on fitness. Vida, started by Stephanie Tilenius, a former Google and eBay executive, claims to help tackle chronic diseases, which account for more than three-quarters of U.S. health-care spending, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"People don't know how to manage these conditions," Tilenius said in an interview with Reuters.
Tilenius said she started the company after witnessing her father struggling with his health, while existing coaching tools were too expensive, she added.
For $15 a week, patients can ask questions, and receive medication reminders and health advice from Vida's team of coaches including nurses, medical assistants, nutritionists and doctors. To ensure high-quality care, Tilenius said the company only accepted and trained 1 percent of people who applied to be a coach, who are paid on an hourly basis.
Doctors and other caregivers can request access to the app to monitor progress over time.
Tilenius has made previous forays into healthcare. She co-founded an online pharmacy startup called PlanetRx in the 1990s but did not return to the health sector until recently.
The "timing is right," she said.
Apple Inc, Google Inc and other Silicon Valley tech giants are currently exploring opportunities in the relatively untapped field of healthcare.
Capital funding for digital health systems in the first half of 2014 reached $2.3 billion, more than the total for all of the previous year, according to a study by Rock Health, which provides startups in the sector with funding and support.
Vida, which is available on Apple's iOS 8 operating system, is integrated with the iPhone maker's HealthKit service, so it can pull in patient-generated data from a variety of wearables and mobile medical devices, such as glucometers. An app for Google Android phones will be released in the coming months.
Vida is also developing a database of clinical trials and disease prevention programs for users. Those include Dr. Mark Hyman's The Blood Sugar Soluton, a treatment program for diabetics and those at risk of contracting the disease.
The startup is now partnering with major U.S. hospitals, like the MD Anderson Cancer Center and Duke University Hospital, which are using the app to deliver remote care to chronically ill patients. She said the company is testing its product with employers, but declined to provide details as those pilots are ongoing.
"A lot of different vendors have been trying to solve this problem, but Vida can drive behavior change," said Jennifer Fonstad of Aspect Ventures, an early investor in the startup. Fonstad said employers are "highly motivated" to adopt tools that can help workers stay healthy and productive.
Vida recently raised $5 million in startup funding from venture firms including Khosla Ventures, Aspect Ventures and Signia Venture Partners, as well as individuals like Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang. (Reporting By Christina Farr; Editing by Alan Crosby)

Alibaba Eyes Payments Tie-Up With Apple; Jack Ma Says He¡¦s Interested in Partnering With U.S. Tech Firm

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.¡XAlibaba Group Holding Ltd., which recently raised $25 billion in the world¡¦s biggest initial public offering in the U.S., is interested in partnering with Apple Inc. in financial payments, the Chinese company¡¦s executive chairman said.
Jack Ma made the comment during an interview at the WSJD Liveglobal technology conference in California late Monday night.
¡§I hope we can do something together,¡¨ Mr. Ma said, though he cautioned that it should be a ¡§marriage¡¨ that both sides want.
Alibaba is already a giant in payments. Its PayPal-like payments service, Alipay, has 300 million active users, Mr. Ma said at the conference. Apple jumped into payments this month with the launch of Apple Pay, a service that will help users of the latest model iPhones pay for items in stores or in mobile apps.
Later in the evening, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the same conference he is going to meet with Mr. Ma later this week to discuss potential partnerships. He said Alibaba has all the traits of a company that Apple would like to partner with, though he didn¡¦t specify whether Apple will work with Alibaba in payments.
Mr. Ma also said that while he¡¦s in California, he is looking into partnerships in the movie business.
¡§China will be the largest movie market in the world,¡¨ Mr. Ma predicted.
Alibaba has been making a push into entertainment to capture a share of what it thinks will be a booming market in China.
In July, Alibaba announced a deal with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. to make available on Alibaba set-top boxes offerings such as the ¡§Twilight¡¨ hit vampire movie series and the TV show ¡§Mad Men.¡¨
Since its IPO in September, Alibaba shares have risen 44% and the company has a market capitalization of more than $240 billion, making it larger than Amazon and eBay combined.
Asked whether Alibaba would be interested in buying PayPal after it splits from parent eBay Inc., Mr. Ma demurred. ¡§I have my Alipay,¡¨ he said.
Alibaba transacted nearly $300 billion in gross merchandise value in the 12 months through June on its Chinese retail marketplaces like Taobao and Tmall.
Mr. Ma also said that he sees ¡§great opportunities in e-commerce in the U.S.¡¨
In June, Alibaba launched a U.S. shopping website, 11 Main, and Mr. Ma noted there is room for more competition beyond the big U.S. e-commerce giants.
¡§Amazon, eBay. You need more.¡¨
Mr. Ma also said that he hopes to connect more American small businesses with China¡¦s booming market, citing huge demand for foreign goods among Chinese consumers. He said that while the last 10 years were about Chinese exports, the next 10 will be about Chinese imports.
Speaking about China, Mr. Ma said he hopes Alibaba can help solve longer-term problems, including health issues that spring from China¡¦s rapid industrialization and the extensive pollution that has been the result.
He also spoke about how he hopes Alibaba will continue to disrupt the Chinese financial system, after its Alipay unit¡¦s money-market fund received slightly under $100 billion in deposits after its launch in June.
¡§If banks do not change, let¡¦s change the banks,¡¨ he said, noting Alipay is the third-largest payment service in the world after Visa and MasterCard.
He said Alibaba wants to build a credit system for individuals and small businesses and ¡§radically¡¨ change the Chinese financial system.
Speaking about the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Mr. Ma said the ¡§Hong Kong part of me (thinks) it¡¦s not about China and Hong Kong relationship. It¡¦s about the young people who don¡¦t have hope. All the big guys take...the good things and the young people feel hopeless. I understand that but they should not push too much. Both sides should listen.¡¨
Hong Kong students have taken to the streets for more than four weeks to protest Beijing¡¦s decision to allow only prescreened candidates to run for the city¡¦s highest chief executive position. Protesters want to choose their own candidates, a move that Hong Kong¡¦s government and Beijing officials say isn¡¦t possible.

Fitch Affirms Santa Clara Valley Water District, CA's $115MM COPs at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable
1,098 words
28 October 2014

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
(The following statement was released by the rating agency) SAN FRANCISCO, October 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its 'AAA' rating on the following certificates of participation (COPS) of the Santa Clara Valley Water District, CA (the district): --$9.3 million series 2004A; --$62.7 million series 2007A; --$43 million series 2012A. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The COPs are payable from installment payments made in connection with the 1994 Installment Agreement (for the series 2003A and 2012A COPs) and 1995 Installment Agreement (2007A COPs). The installment payments are secured by a first lien on gross revenues of the district's flood control system, which include voter-approved benefit assessments. KEY RATING DRIVERS STRONG BASE PROVIDES ASSESSMENTS: The fixed benefit assessments are levied on all parcels in Santa Clara County's (the county) very large, wealthy, and diverse tax base.
 GUARANTEED COLLECTIONS OFFSET COVERAGE: The county guarantee of 100% of the benefit assessments levied minimizes variability in pledged revenue, offsetting the 1.25x maximum annual debt service (MADS) limit to the benefit assessment. LIMITED OPERATING RISK: The flood control operations have limited operational risk. RATING SENSITIVITIES SHIFTS IN ASSESSMENT PAYERS: The rating is sensitive to a significant decline in the number or economic profile of parcels in the district. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that such a change is highly unlikely. CREDIT PROFILE STRONG STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS The district is a multi-purpose special district, coterminous with the county and charged with providing flood protection services and water to county residents. The COPs are secured by gross revenues of the flood control system. In 1986 and 1990, voters authorized the district to levy benefit assessments on all district parcels based on the benefit received by each parcel from flood control services while simultaneously limiting the total benefit assessments levied to 1.25x MADS on certificates outstanding prior to June 30, 1995, or refundings of those COPs. Fiscal 2015 assessments on residential properties range from $15 to $44 per parcel in the district's five flood zones. The district covenants to annually reset the benefit assessments levied to provide debt service coverage (DSC) of 1.25x MADS. The assessment is levied on property on parity with all other property taxes and collection is guaranteed by the county, which participates in the Teeter program. The property tax base is diverse, with the top 10 largest benefit assessment payers accounting for about 6.7% of the total. FAVORABLE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; SOUND COVERAGE Financial results within flood control operations (which are included in the district's governmental activities) are strong, characterized by high fund balance levels. Though COPs are primarily secured by the assessment levies, they are ultimately secured by a gross revenue pledge on virtually all flood control system revenues. Aside from the benefit assessments, the primary source of flood control system revenue is the district's portion of the county 1% property levy that it allocates to flood protection. The district allocated $55.6 million of the 1% property tax (or about 50%) to the flood control system in fiscal 2013, resulting in DSC of about 4.95x, according to the district's fiscal 2013 continuing disclosure annual report. However, this tax allocation is at the discretion of the board; in any year the board could elect to allocate no portion of the 1% property tax to flood control. Fitch believes that this is unlikely; nonetheless, the 'AAA' rating relies solely on the security provided by the benefit assessment. BROAD AND EXPANDING TAX AND ASSESSMENT BASE The district and county encompass 1,330 square miles, 1.8 million residents, and more than 400,000 parcels. Fitch expects the number of parcels to remain fairly stable The county economy is strong and diverse. The county's assessed valuation (AV) increased by 2.8% on average annually from fiscal 2008-2014 despite a 2.3% decline in fiscal 2011, reflecting the impact of the housing correction. AV has since recovered with gains of 0.9% and 3.2% in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, respectively. Fiscal 2014 AV jumped 8.4% and fiscal 2015 AV is reportedly up another 6.8%, reflecting the county's currently very strong economic growth. Wealth levels are well above average (per capita income is 139% of the state level). The economy has above-average exposure to the cyclical high-technology sector, but also benefits from a significant amount of venture capital invested in local companies. Large private employers include Google, Cisco, Apple, Stanford University, Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, Kaiser, Applied Materials, Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Intel Corporation.

(Adds executive comments, details, estimates, shares)
By Abhirup Roy
Oct 28 (Reuters) - Corning Inc, the supplier of Gorilla glass to Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics , reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings, helped by launches of new smartphone models.
Shares of the company, which also supplies LCD panels to consumer electronics companies such as Sony Corp, LG and Lenovo Group, rose 1.6 percent in early trading.
Smartphones such as Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and Samsung's Galaxy Alpha were launched in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Corning said it would launch a new version of Gorilla glass on Nov. 20.
The company, however, said fourth-quarter core sales in its speciality materials business, which makes Gorilla glass, were expected to decline by low- to mid-teen digits percent from the third quarter due to the absence of any major new launches.
"What happens after a new launch is at some point, they take enough glass to continue to build out their products and that's why we think that in the fourth quarter, we'll see sales down," Senior Vice President Tony Tripeny told Reuters.
Its LCD panel volumes in the current quarter are expected to be flat or fall slightly from the previous quarter as most of the holiday season orders had been shipped in the third quarter, Tripeny said.
Corning had been hurt by falling LCD glass prices in the past few quarters, but the company said the pace of the price decline was moderating.
The company's core net sales rose to $2.65 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.1 billion, a year earlier.
Net income rose to $1.01 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $408 million, or 28 cents per share.
The company reported core earnings of 40 cents per share.
Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of 37 cents per share and revenue of $2.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Corning shares were up 1 percent at $19.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by Kirti Pandey)

Apple CEO Tim Cook Happy With New Apple Pay Service; iPhone Will Still Account For Most of Apple¡¦s Revenue and Profit

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.¡XApple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook said more than one million credit cards were activated on the company¡¦s new Apple Pay service within 72 hours of its debut last week.
Speaking at the WSJD Live Global Technology Conference, Mr. Cook said the number of activations makes Apple Pay the largest mobile-payment offering.
Mr. Cook said reports of retailers such as Rite Aid Corp. and CVS Health Corp. not accepting Apple Pay at stores amounted to a skirmish. Neither company had officially joined Apple¡¦s network, but some customers last week found they could use Apple Pay in Rite Aid and CVS stores. The two retailers later disabled that functionality; it wasn¡¦t immediately clear why.
Rite Aid and CVS, along with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co., are part of a retailer-owned mobile-technology group called Merchant Customer Exchange, which will employ software that can be used on both iPhones and Android phones. The service is still in pilot mode and won¡¦t roll out nationally until next year.
Mr. Cook expressed confidence that Apple Pay will thrive in the long run.
¡§You are only relevant as a retailer or merchant if your customers love you,¡¨ he said. ¡§It¡¦s the first and only mobile payment system that¡¦s easy, private and secure.¡¨
Apple started its payment service on Oct. 20, allowing U.S. consumers to buy items at more than 220,000 stores or inside apps using the latest iPhones and a thumbprint.
Apple has signed up the six biggest credit-card issuers, accounting for roughly 83% of credit-card transactions in the U.S., with 500 financial institutions coming by early next year. It also has the three major credit-card networks: Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and American Express Co.
Despite the potential and growth of Apple Pay, Mr. Cook said the iPhone will probably comprise the majority of the company¡¦s revenue and profit for the next three to five years.
Asked about suggestions from investor Carl Icahn that Apple should repurchase more of its own shares, Mr. Cook said dryly, ¡§Yes, we have some cash.¡¨
Apple reported holding roughly $155 billion in cash and investments at the end of September. Mr. Cook said Apple bought back $17 billion worth of stock during the September quarter, and $45 billion in the fiscal year through September.
Mr. Cook said share repurchases are a good thing, but secondary to reinvesting in Apple¡¦s business.
He also addressed recent criticism from law enforcement regarding Apple¡¦s decision to encrypt data on its iPhones when locked.
¡§I look at that and say if law enforcement wants something, they should go to the user and get it. It¡¦s not for me to do it,¡¨ said Mr. Cook.
He added that it was better that the company didn¡¦t design its products ¡§with the keys under the mat,¡¨ because hackers could exploit the same opening.
Mr. Cook also made a thinly veiled criticism of Google Inc., saying that Apple wasn¡¦t checking what its users are searching, reading its users¡¦ email, or tracking the temperature in their homes or what they are buying.
¡§We¡¦re not Big Brother,¡¨ said Mr. Cook. ¡§We¡¦ll leave that to others.¡¨
An email sent to Google PR wasn¡¦t immediately answered.

Good morning from Laguna Beach,
On the first day of our WSJDLive conference, we explored questions about technology¡¦s ever-increasing role on the world stage. Alibaba¡¦s Jack Ma said that the e-commerce giant is interested in partnering with Apple in financial payments, cautioning that it should be a ¡§marriage¡¨ that both sides want. When I asked Apple CEO Tim Cook about the possibility, he expressed interest. Mr. Cook also told me that more than one million credit cards were activated on the company¡¦s new Apple Pay service within 72 hours of its debut last week. Today, we will hear the perspectives of investors, including Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel. With the conference in the backdrop, we also examine challenges that come with advancements in technology, such as regulatory concerns on the web. In our revealing example, law-enforcement officials want Icann, the closest thing the Internet has to a regulator, to take action against websites suspected of selling drugs without a prescription, but the Internet gatekeeper says its powers are limited. And speaking of investors, Twitter shares tumbled yesterday after the messaging service reported slowing user growth. For more coverage of our event¡Xwhich will continue through Wednesday¡Xfollow #WSJDLive on Twitter, and get the latest news and videos here.
Gasoline prices have dropped below $3 a gallon at most U.S. gas stations, offering Americans a welcome break at the pump. But we find that the news also carries a thorny underside. Our story looks at how the latest drop is spurring debate over how much falling prices will squeeze domestic producers. High oil prices have driven the recent energy boom, making it possible to use costly drilling techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing. While the price drop gives consumers a lift before the holidays, producers could see profits shrink and investors may rethink their investments in the sector. We note that Wall Street¡¦s oil bulls are already throwing in the towel, conceding that the 25% drop in crude prices since June won¡¦t be reversed soon. But perhaps the most crucial question is what lower prices mean for oil-rich states such as Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota. ¡§If the wheels come off, the energy-producing economies are going to suffer,¡¨ noted a senior director at Rice University¡¦s Center for Energy Studies.
Federal officials rejected the mandatory quarantines that at least two states have ordered to contain the spread of Ebola. We report that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that people deemed to be at high risk of developing the virus voluntarily isolate themselves from others for 21 days¡Xcountering New York and New Jersey, which imposed more stringent measures. We note that the news comes as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie¡¦s administration said that a nurse held in a tent in a Newark hospital would be privately transported to her home in Maine. She had publicly challenged her isolation over the weekend. Meanwhile, we find that a 5-year-old boy who had been showing Ebola-like symptoms after recently returning to New York from West Africa doesn¡¦t have the disease, a spokesman for New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation said yesterday.
While many people dread the cold season, some actually cheer up and draw energy from the long, dark days of winter. Our Work & Family columnist Sue Shellenbarger looks at new research that is shedding light on the possible causes of summer blues and ways to cope. ¡§People complain about snow, while I hope every potential flake turns into a blizzard,¡¨ notes one sufferer. Potential reasons for hating the summer include aversion to humidity, allergies to pollen and psychological triggers such as hating to sweat. Descending into the New York City subway in the warm weather triggers this primal response from another loather of summer: ¡§It¡¦s like Satan¡¦s basement.¡¨ For a deeper look at research on seasonal mood swings and methods to deal with it, be sure to read Sue¡¦s column.

Corporate News: Alibaba Shows Interest in Apple Payments

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which recently raised $25 billion in the world's biggest initial public offering in the U.S., is interested in partnering with Apple Inc. in financial payments, the Chinese company's executive chairman said.
Jack Ma made the comment during an interview at the WSJD Live global technology conference in California late Monday.
"I hope we can do something together," Mr. Ma said, though he cautioned that it should be a "marriage" that both sides want.
Alibaba is already a giant in payments. Its PayPal-like payments service, Alipay, has 300 million active users, Mr. Ma said at the conference. Apple jumped into payments this month with the launch of Apple Pay, a service that will help users of the latest model iPhones pay for items in stores or in mobile apps.
Later in the evening, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the same conference he is going to meet with Mr. Ma later this week to discuss potential partnerships. He said Alibaba has all the traits of a company that Apple would like to partner with, though he didn't specify whether Apple will work with Alibaba in payments.
Mr. Ma also said that while he is in California, he is looking into partnerships in the movie business.
"China will be the largest movie market in the world," Mr. Ma predicted.
Alibaba has been making a push into entertainment to capture a share of what it thinks will be a booming market in China.
In July, Alibaba announced a deal with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. to make available on Alibaba set-top boxes offerings such as the "Twilight" hit vampire movie series and the TV show "Mad Men."
Since its IPO in September, Alibaba shares have risen 44% and the company has a market capitalization of more than $240 billion, making it larger than Amazon and eBay combined.
Asked whether Alibaba would be interested in buying PayPal after it splits from parent eBay Inc., Mr. Ma demurred. "I have my Alipay," he said.
Alibaba transacted nearly $300 billion in gross merchandise value in the 12 months through June on its Chinese retail marketplaces like Taobao and Tmall.
Mr. Ma also said that he sees "great opportunities in e-commerce in the U.S."
In June, Alibaba launched a U.S. shopping website, 11 Main, and Mr. Ma noted there is room for more competition beyond the big U.S. e-commerce giants.

James Dimon won't like this.
Back in 2011, J.P. Morgan Chase and its chief relinquished the title of biggest U.S. bank by market value to Wells Fargo. Now comes a further indignity: J.P. Morgan's market value late last week was overtaken by Facebook's. This happened as the tech giant, which reports results Tuesday, issued new shares to fund its purchase of WhatsApp. Markets didn't ding Facebook for the dilution, so its value rose. It was worth $224 billion Monday versus about $221 billion for J.P. Morgan.
Facebook joins the ranks of tech stalwarts such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, all with market values bigger than J.P. Morgan's. Tech's dominance is really clear when you look at Apple: J.P. Morgan and Wells have a combined market value equal to only three-quarters that of the iPhone maker. No wonder graduates increasingly choose Silicon Valley over Wall Street these days.

WSJ.D Technology: Samsung's Primacy Is Tested By Rise of Chinese Players
By Jonathan Cheng   
806 words
28 October 2014

(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   
SHANGHAI -- Samsung Electronics Co.'s attempt to stay on top of the fast-changing smartphone business will depend on winning back people like He Wenzong.
The 30-year-old apparel-company employee and Shanghai resident last year traded his Galaxy S3 phone, one of Samsung's most successful products, for a handset made by Beijing-based upstart Xiaomi Inc., which a few months ago displaced Samsung as China's No. 1 smartphone seller.
Xiaomi's phone offers better software and services, Mr. He says, at a fraction of a new Samsung's price. "To me, it looks like it's the same quality, but one costs 2,000 yuan ($327) and the other is 3,500 yuan," says Mr. He. "So why would I pick Samsung?"
Across China -- and around the globe -- other people are starting to feel the same way. Samsung has lost its top position for mobile-phone sales in India, and research firms that track smartphone shipments say it is in danger of being toppled in Thailand and the Philippines. Though Samsung is still the No. 1 smartphone maker globally, it has been losing market share in recent quarters.
In China, where Samsung gets 18% of its total sales, the company is parachuting in executives and outside consultants to assess the problem and figure out how to fix it, according to people with knowledge of the moves. The company is lowering prices for its existing handsets by up to 20% and preparing to roll out a new, cheaper line of smartphones for emerging markets, the people said.
The steps are part of a larger attempt to shore up the mobile-phone division, which accounts for around 60% of Samsung's operating profit.
On Thursday, the company is expected to report that operating profit for the quarter ended in September has fallen by about 60% from a year earlier, following a 20% decline in the quarter before, largely because of what the company acknowledged was "increased competition" in China.
After leading sales in the Chinese smartphone market every quarter for the past two-and-a-half years, Samsung dropped behind Xiaomi during the quarter ended June, tying for second place with Lenovo Group Ltd. and Coolpad Group Ltd., according to data tracker Canalys.
Samsung has cut the bonuses of hundreds of managers in its mobile division, according to people familiar with the matter. In an attempt to streamline operations, Samsung is combining many of its main business divisions in the U.S. under one chief, say people with direct knowledge of the move. That could foreshadow a similar consolidation of leadership at headquarters, where the company is run by three co-chief executives, said one of these people.
In an attempt to bring down its manufacturing costs, Samsung opened a $2 billion mobile-phone factory in Vietnam last year, and in July won approval from Vietnamese authorities for another factory to produce smartphone and tablet displays.
A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment on its China strategy or personnel moves.
Samsung began building up extensive distribution networks to sell its televisions and mobile phones in the 1990s, giving it a sizable head start versus Apple when it began roll out high-end smartphones. Since most Chinese consumers buy their phones at mobile-phone or consumer-electronics retail outlets rather than through carriers, Samsung's network of stores let it reach consumers from small villages to big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
Recently, however, more Chinese consumers are buying phones online, and many of Samsung's Chinese rivals, like Xiaomi, sell primarily that way, which also lowers their overhead. Xiaomi sells its handsets at close to cost, aiming to make money on software and services sold over the phones instead -- a tactic that lets it undercut Samsung prices.
Samsung's Chinese rivals run Google Inc.'s Android operating system -- like the vast majority of Samsung's smartphones. But they have been more efficient at pre-loading sales-generating apps on their phones and promoting their own app stores.
Samsung, by its own admission, has been slow to respond. The company kept its prices high, even on lower-tier smartphones.
To unload excess inventory, Samsung has lowered some smartphone prices in China by between 10% and 20%, a tactic that could help it recapture some market share in the second half of the year, Canalys says.
The company is also preparing to release -- initially in China -- a new line of smartphones dubbed Galaxy A, a midrange phone that offers many of the features of a high-end Galaxy S device but is priced more competitively with Chinese phones, according to people familiar with the plans.

A Buyer¡¦s Guide to Business Computers; Many Companies Switch to Tailoring Purchases to Individual Needs

For companies looking to buy workplace computers, the decision used to consist of two basic choices: Laptop or desktop? Windows or Mac? Now, the options for employees¡¦ computing needs are becoming increasingly diverse¡Xand confusing.
The popularity of smartphones and tablets in people¡¦s personal lives helped spark a broader rethinking of how work gets done, and what computing devices are best to keep employees happy and productive. On the wane is the idea of companies buying 5,000 of the same brand desktops for everybody, and repeating the cycle every five years or so.
¡§It¡¦s definitely not a one-size-fits-all world anymore,¡¨ says J.P. Gownder, a Forrester Research Inc. analyst who consults with companies on their technology.
That means more companies are mixing it up, tailoring their computer choices to fit a variety of jobs. One company may have a fleet of iPads for its salespeople to show coming shoe designs to clients, and conventional desktop PCs for its workers at the home office. Others are buying stripped-down laptops that rely mostly on connections to corporate networks via the Internet. And a small number of businesses are letting the employees decide what kinds of computers work best for their jobs.
Mr. Gownder¡¦s basic advice to companies: Do an audit. Ask employees¡Xthrough simple survey programs like SurveyMonkey, and during in-depth interviews¡Xhow they use computers, phones and tablets for work, and what they feel they¡¦re missing. And he says companies shouldn¡¦t forget to pay attention to what workers are doing and using without corporate permission. That may be even more revealing than what they say in a survey.
For businesses trying to balance costs with complexity and strategic goals, here is a rundown of five categories of workplace computing options, and the major benefits and drawbacks of each.
1. The Old Standby: Windows
Computers running the Windows operating system have been a workplace staple for three decades, and remain appealing to companies for three big reasons: familiarity, compatibility and breadth.
Most software¡Xparticularly older or customized corporate programs¡Xhas been built to work best on Windows. IT staff know how to work on and fix problems with Windows machines. Workers know how to use Windows (although Microsoft Corp.¡¦s latest version, Windows 8, has prompted some retraining). The variety of machines using Windows means there¡¦s practically a PC for every need.
Website publisher CBS Interactive has been shifting some of its computer purchases back to Windows PCs from Apple Inc.¡¦s Mac computers. The CBS Corp. unit says it¡¦s gravitating toward Windows laptops that are similar in look and feel to the slim MacBook Air, but with work-friendly features such as more ports to connect machines to desktop computer monitors.
With new types of machines¡Xlike PCs that can double as tablets, or those that seek the same long battery life and sleek look of the MacBook Air¡XMicrosoft and its allies are trying to ditch their reputation for making the clunky, bug-prone workhorses employees hate to use.
Companies that sell PCs to businesses say the biggest gripes about Windows-based machines are in part due to the businesses saddling their workers with old and underpowered machines. Make sure to purchase machines hardy enough to run all the software employees need, they say.
2. Tablets
For many workers, tablets are an add-on rather than a replacement for their PCs. Experts say companies need to make sure tablets are worth the extra cost, since they are fragile and easy to lose.
For road-warrior workers, however, or technicians who hardly ever sit at a desk, tablets can be revolutionary.
Mary Kay Inc. says tablets have changed how its three million sales consultants pitch the company¡¦s beauty products. Using a customized app called ¡§Show and Sell,¡¨ created with New York firm ScrollMotion Inc., the Mary Kay reps tailor what skin-care products they show women. And they can connect a tablet to a TV so groups of women at Mary Kay parties can watch how-to videos about the products.
For the consultants, this is a big improvement from the days when they had to make women flip through a thick catalog to show a handful of products that were appropriate for their age or skin type. The consultants also can hand the customer the tablet to make a purchase right away. ¡§That really helps make the sale easier,¡¨ says Sara Friedman, Mary Kay¡¦s vice president of U.S. marketing.
But businesses can¡¦t just give employees tablets without a plan. For instance, companies need to make sure that all of the software their workers use can be accessed from mobile devices. That can be a complicated and costly effort. General Electric Co., for example, made a significant investment to rework its applications to work seamlessly on tablets and phones.
And buyer beware. Just because the boss decides tablets are the ticket to productive workers, it doesn¡¦t mean the devices will catch on. Even if the tablets truly are more useful than a desktop, broad acceptance often depends on what the managers themselves are using.
AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc. buys iPads for its workforce of more than 150 people, but many of them sit unused in people¡¦s desk drawers, says Nate McBride, a vice president for the Waltham, Mass.-based company. Many of AMAG¡¦s managers don¡¦t have the time or the inclination to incorporate the tablets into their work lives, and employees follow their lead, Mr. McBride says.
3. Chromebooks or ¡§Virtual¡¨ Desktops
Another mobile option is what the technology industry calls ¡§thin clients¡¨¡Xmachines where most if not all tasks are done over the Internet or via remote corporate-computing networks. Almost nothing is saved on the computer itself.
The most visible examples of this are Chromebooks, which are simplified laptops powered by Google Inc.¡¦s Chrome operating system. Companies including Citrix Systems Inc., VMware Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. also sell ¡§virtual desktop¡¨ software that gives employees remote access to a handful of work applications or a mirror of their corporate PCs from any Internet-connected device.
The downsides of thin clients are many. Chromebooks and computers using virtual-desktop software sometimes are incompatible with software that was designed to be installed on the computer itself, such as the teleconference service GoToMeeting from Citrix. And while lots of work-related apps for tablets were designed to function offline, the thin clients are nearly entirely dependent on having a good broadband or cellular network connection.
For business users that can make do with limited computing features, however, thin clients¡¦ big benefits of low cost and control outweigh the risks.
Chromebooks are inexpensive to buy and replace, and it¡¦s easy to fix problems remotely, says David Hoff, senior vice president of technology at Cloud Sherpas, an Atlanta-based firm that helps companies buy technology from Google and other providers. Chromebooks typically cost $250 to $350 each, plus $150 a machine for business support. Managers can set up a list of common Web bookmarks for many employees at once, or restrict which websites or other functions the Chromebook user can access.
Full-size iPads, by comparison, cost $499 and up for the latest model. And while iPads can also be managed remotely, it¡¦s not as easy as it is with a Chromebook.
Mr. Hoff says his firm is seeing the most adoption of Chromebooks by companies with lots of mobile employees who previously weren¡¦t using computers at all. One of his clients, for example, is a chain of franchised deli restaurants that has a few hundred managers who pop from store to store and don¡¦t have a regular desk or an IT staff to help when things go wrong. For them, he says, Chromebooks make sense because the managers¡¦ needs¡Xand their resources¡Xare limited.
4. Macs
The knock on Macs in the workplace has been they¡¦re expensive, they lack built-in tools to manage large numbers of computers at once, and sometimes aren¡¦t ideal to use with common workplace applications, many of which are tailored to work best¡Xor only¡Xon Windows PCs. Some of those objections are easing, particularly as workers do more with software designed for the Web.
Jason Wudi, chief technology officer for JAMF Software, a Minneapolis-based company that provides tools for businesses to manage Macs, says companies don¡¦t often set out to buy Mac computers, but often do so in capitulation to employees.
¡§We go where people are already demanding and dragging in their user devices,¡¨ Mr. Wudi says.
In some industries, such as media or technology firms, potential new recruits also expect a Mac on every desk, and not having them can be a barrier to recruiting.
5. Bring Your Own Device
For a small number of companies, the best approach to workplace computers is not to favor any particular type at all. Companies tell workers to buy and bring to work whatever they want. Typically, employers will offer a stipend to offset all or part of the cost.
The do-it-yourself movement at companies started with smartphones, but the wave has started spreading to computers, too.
But if companies give workers the money, and they buy a really cheap tablet that can¡¦t run any of a company¡¦s corporate apps, the scenario may not help the company. IT support also can be tough if an organization has a fleet of different devices.
The trend reflects worker unhappiness with being forced to use what their companies give them. More than half of workers, and roughly two-thirds of younger workers, say the computers they use at home are better than their equipment at work, according to Forrester Research surveys.

Good morning from Los Angeles,
I¡¦m here at the inaugural WSJDLive event, where executives from some of the world¡¦s top technology companies, entrepreneurs, investors, innovators and thinkers will discuss the rapidly evolving digital landscape. This evening I will be talking with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, and Dennis Berman, the Journal¡¦s business editor, will interview Alibaba¡¦s Jack Ma. Look out for our coverage on WSJD.
Republicans are investing in additional House races¡Xfurther evidence that U.S. voters may be making a late turn away from the Democratic Party. Our story looks at fresh signs that indicate the political climate is tilting toward the GOP ahead of next week¡¦s elections. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Annenberg survey found that Ebola fears and the U.S. war on Islamic State have taken a toll on both parties but hurt Democrats more. We also note that Democrats have withdrawn money recently from some GOP-held districts and redirected it largely to endangered incumbents in an effort to limit GOP gains. Meanwhile, the politics this weekend has been consumed with a spat over how to contain the deadly virus. The White House pushed back against the governors of New York, New Jersey, Illinois and other states that instituted procedures to forcibly quarantine medical workers returning from West Africa.
At first glance, a recent hatchet attack on two police officers seemed like the work of a deranged man acting alone. But to law-enforcement officials, the incident¡Xwhich took place in New York on Thursday¡Xrepresents the growing threat of self-radicalized terrorists inspired by extremist websites and social media. Our story examines the rising concern over these one-off, homegrown attacks, which are much harder to pinpoint than the more complex terror plots that have been the focus of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for more than a decade. New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said on Friday that even though police believe the man acted alone, they are treating it as a terrorist attack. ¡§There is a growing number of these individuals out there,¡¨ he said. We note that the incident occurred a day after the attack in Ottawa, Canada, in which a lone gunman shot and killed a soldier at a national war memorial before storming the Parliament building and being gunned down.
Brazil¡¦s first female president has earned herself another four more years by nurturing deep support among the country¡¦s poor. We report that Dilma Rousseff won a second term yesterday, defeating the conservative A?cio Neves in a bitter race that exposed Brazil¡¦s economic and social fault lines. The election posed questions about the depth of corruption in the country and highlighted deep divisions among Brazilians over the way to move forward. . As for the U.S., we note that the outcome likely prolongs a period of stagnant relations with Latin America¡¦s biggest economy¡Xa major player in a region where leftist leaders with ambivalent views of the U.S. have won elections in recent years. Meanwhile, we find that Ms. Rousseff now faces two pressing challenges: mending a divided electorate and reviving her nation¡¦s stagnant economy. She may seek a conciliatory tone in the coming days and try to win over Brazilian business leaders with a corporate tax break.
Some people ride bikes for exercise, while others do so to get from A to B. One new startup in Detroit plans to use pedal power to make beer. Our story looks at how two brothers intend to fit out their microbrewery with stationary bikes hooked up to produce the electricity needed to brew beer. ¡§We are trying to change the mode of biking from recreation and transportation to energy production,¡¨ Shawn Grose, a former science teacher, said. We note that he and his brother Aaron are among many entrepreneurs attempting to fuel Detroit¡¦s revival with bright ideas. But there are more efficient ways to produce energy. To see how the boys use bikes to brew beer, check out our video.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Google makes U.S. trade arbiter look patently daft

By Reynolds Holding
NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Google is making America's trade arbiter look patently daft. The search giant and other technology companies say an International Trade Commission ban on imports of infringing items in digital form could disrupt the internet. Websites and cloud computing firms could also become even easier prey for patent trolls.
The ITC's remit is to block foreign "articles" that violate intellectual property rights. A recent case, though, raised the novel question of whether the term "articles" includes digital models imported electronically to help make teeth-straightening devices. The commission said in April that it does - despite decades of defining "articles" to mean only tangible goods.
The context makes the ruling understandable up to a point. Music, software, data for 3D printers and many other bits of information move over the internet. If that creates loopholes that skirt patents, just as clever legal structures lacking economic substance help avoid tax, say, there's an argument for making the workarounds illegal.
But that's not the ITC's call. As Google, eBay and others stress in a legal brief filed under the auspices of the Internet Association, allowing a minor U.S. agency to regulate internet traffic could seriously impede the global movement of data. It would also encourage so-called trolls, which own patents but make nothing, to file lawsuits demanding that the ITC block websites, file-sharing services and a host of other online businesses.
The commission is already a favorite forum for trolls, which account for about a quarter of its cases. And no wonder: The ITC decides disputes in half the time taken by federal courts and has more leeway to issue orders quashing alleged infringers. The likes of Apple and Samsung even use it as a battleground for their smartphone wars. The agency, created in 1916 to support American trade policy, holds almost a fifth of U.S. patent trials.
Thorny issues like how to protect intellectual property from online infringement are for Congress to decide - or at least courts steeped in precedent. A federal appeals court is about to weigh in on the teeth-straightening case. To paraphrase Google's corporate motto, it's the perfect opportunity to remind the ITC not to be evil. 
              
              
              
              
CONTEXT NEWS
              
- Google and dozens of other internet companies on Oct. 16 filed briefs urging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reverse an International Trade Commission ruling that would ban imports of digital data used to create patent-infringing products.
- The ITC ruled in April that electronically transmitted information qualifies as an "article" that can be banned under the U.S. Tariff Act. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Align Technology against ClearCorrect Operating for allegedly infringing patents on teeth-straightening devices. ClearCorrect generated digital models in Pakistan and then transmitted them to Texas so they could be transformed into actual braces.
- Oral arguments before the appeals court have not yet been scheduled.

Nokia Gives Bullish Outlook as It Swings Back to Profit; Finnish Telecom-Equipment Maker Benefits From Sales to North America and China and Tax Gain

STOCKHOLM¡XNokia Corp.¡¦s quarterly earnings gave ample evidence that the company¡¦s main network unit has moved well beyond several years of painful restructuring.
In its earnings report on Thursday, the Finnish former handset giant gave a more bullish full-year financial outlook after swinging back to profit in the third quarter. Its earnings were boosted by a 13% rise in revenue, as the Finnish telecom-equipment supplier deployed high-speed mobile networks in North America and China.
Nokia¡¦s net profit in the quarter was £á747 million ($941 million), compared with a £á91 million loss in the three months to end-September last year, helped also by a large tax gain in the quarter. Revenue rose to £á3.32 billion, higher than market expectations of £á3.02 billion.
¡§Progress was widespread, with four of our six regions increasing sales,¡¨ Nokia¡¦s chief executive, Rajeev Suri, said.
Mr. Suri has headed Nokia¡¦s mobile network unit since 2009 and was appointed as Nokia¡¦s CEO in late April this year, as the company transferred its loss-making phone business to Microsoft Corp. Without its ailing handset business, Nokia is now a mobile networks firm that competes with Huawei Technologies Co. and Ericsson. It also has a Berlin-based digital mapping operation and a large pile of patents.
Nokia¡¦s mobile-network arm, which until recently was plagued with overcapacity and losses after a difficult merger with Siemens¡¦ mobile network unit, has seen a spectacular comeback over the course of the past year, and is currently benefiting from deals with the likes of China Mobile Ltd. and Sprint Corp. in the U.S., which are ramping up their high-speed mobile Internet services.
Nokia updated its outlook for the year, saying it expects a full-year operating profit margin of slightly above 11%, having previously forecast a margin in the high single digits. It confirmed that it expects net sales for its main networks unit to grow on a year-on-year basis in the second half of 2014.
Nokia¡¦s stock rose sharply Thursday on the Helsinki stock exchange after the earnings release, finishing the day 3.5% higher at £á6.74. Analysts widely agreed that the company¡¦s results were impressive.
¡§Retaining [its] market share while implementing such a drastic cost-cutting program is an impressive exercise, which the company should take great pride in,¡¨ Nordea analyst Sami Sarkamies wrote in a note to investors, while cautioning that Nokia¡¦s networks business is a relatively small operation, sensitive to quarterly swings in project invoicing and margins.
Mr. Suri described the performance of the company¡¦s main networks business as ¡§particularly satisfying,¡¨ but cautioned that the unit benefited from some ¡§unique developments¡¨ in the quarter, such as a favorable business and regional mix.
The Finnish company booked a £á2 billion tax benefit in the quarter, which was partly offset by a £á1.2 billion goodwill impairment charge related to its HERE digital mapping unit. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Suri said the accounting charge for HERE was the ¡§right thing to do, considering the track record of HERE and the ways things are progressing.¡¨
Unlike Google Inc. and Apple Inc.¡¦s mapping services, Nokia¡¦s platform largely targets corporate customers, like auto makers and logistics-dependent businesses such as FedEx Corp., which pay licensing fees. Still, the company is about to release free-of-charge map apps for consumers using mobile devices running Google¡¦s Android and Apple¡¦s iOS platform.
Mr. Suri, however, said he isn¡¦t in favor of running adverts on Nokia¡¦s mapping service, as Google does, and that the business will remain geared toward enterprise customers and the automotive industry. He added that while its mapping operation may appear an odd fit next to Nokia¡¦s network business, the company is a suitable owner of the unit.
¡§Nokia is a good owner of HERE, we have a balance sheet that can help the operation,¡¨ he said, adding that combining advanced high-speed network technology with a mapping asset can assist developers of autonomous cars, for instance.
In a separate announcement on Thursday, Nokia said it would appoint Sean Fernback as the new president of its HERE unit. Mr. Fernback, a former TomTom NV executive, joined HERE earlier this year and will succeed Michael Halbherr, who stepped down and left the unit in August.

ZURICH¡XLogitech International SA¡¦s turnaround won¡¦t be derailed by a slowdown in the tablet computer market, the company¡¦s chief executive said Thursday, even though the peripherals maker has hitched much of its revival to mobile computing devices.
On Wednesday, Logitech, based in Newark, Calif., and Lausanne, Switzerland, said its profit more than doubled during its second quarter, even though sales of tablet accessories, like detachable keyboards, fell 19% in the period amid a slowdown in tablet sales.
In an interview, Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said a slowdown in the tablet market wouldn¡¦t disrupt Logitech¡¦s growth. He said the company isn¡¦t dependent on one market, pointing to the success of a newly launched computer mouse designed for videogamers and mobile speakers.
¡§If tablets slow down, we have other growth areas,¡¨ said Mr. Darrell, adding that tablet accessory sales would likely pick up early next year as new products hit the market. ¡§We are not dependent on tablets or any one single platform to deliver our turnaround.¡¨
Logitech, the world¡¦s biggest maker of computer mouses, was caught flat-footed by the sudden rise of tablets and smartphones. Since taking over early last year, Mr. Darrell has pushed the company to have shorter design and production cycles so that its peripherals can be in stores shortly after the launch of new devices. Many of those are designed for popular tablet computers, like Apple Inc.¡¦s iPads and Samsung Electronics Co.¡¦s Galaxy tablets.
However, growth in tablet computer sales has slowed this year. Worldwide unit shipments are expected to grow 11% in 2014, a sharp deceleration from 55% growth in 2013, according to estimates by market researcher Gartner Inc.
Logitech has broadened its product range, launching a new gaming keyboard and mouse, a new wireless mouse and a multiple-device keyboard that can be used with tablets and smartphones. Mr. Darrell said new products would continue to be launched in the coming months, including products for Apple¡¦s new iPad.
On Thursday, Logitech indicated the strategy was paying off. Net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 increased 151% to $36.1 million from $14.4 million a year earlier. The result, driven by cost cuts and the absence of restructuring charges it faced last year, beat analysts¡¦ forecast of $23.4 million.
Sales fell slightly to $530.3 million from $532 million a year earlier, in line with forecasts of $530 million.
Logitech confirmed its guidance for full-year operating income to $170 million.
¡§The results show that Logitech is no longer dependent on one or two categories,¡¨ said Michael Foeth, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich. Mr. Foeth rates Logitech at buy.
During the period, Logitech¡¦s mobile speaker business was its star performer, posting triple-digit sales growth. The mobile speakers work with smartphones and tablet computers.
Logitech said an investigation of accounting matters related to previously issued financial statements is now closed. The company expects to file its reports as soon as possible with the SIX Swiss Exchange and Nasdaq, which carries its U.S. listing.

A Reason to Stress About Europe Banks
When everyone is staring in one direction, it often pays to look the other way.
European bank stocks have endured a wild ride as the Continent's "stress test" results near. The European Central Bank is due to release them Sunday. Greek, Portuguese and some Italian and Spanish banks have suffered especially.
That is understandable. There are plenty of questions about European banks' capital strength. And no one wants to own a bank that comes asking for more equity.
But too many banks have been tainted by this worry. So there is a good chance that solid, unloved institutions will rally once the uncertainty of the stress tests is past and investors can refocus on the ECB's stimulus efforts.
If, that is, the tests are credible. A lot rides on the stress tests for the ECB, which takes over eurozone bank supervision from national governments next month.
Its reputation will be based on its review of banks' books and the stress tests.
The last tests under the sole supervision of the European Banking Authority were risible; several banks passed only to require bailouts later.
Even with the ECB now at the helm, there is skepticism about how conclusive the tests will be. Europe, after all, has many competing voices and levels of economic health. Muddy political compromise is a near-inevitable outcome.
And the European tests can never draw the same bright line as did those in the U.S. in 2009. The ECB, for example, can tell a bank it must raise capital. But it can't promise that a government will inject some if the bank can't or won't.
However, because the last European tests didn't work and the ECB's own credibility rests on the new ones, there is a decent chance they will be good enough. While some banks will indeed fail, investors may find there is opportunity to be had in a glass-half-full approach.
As things now stand, banks such as ING Groep of the Netherlands and Credit Agricole or even BNP Paribas of France aren't valued as recovery stories with big gains due from once-bad assets. Nor are they shunned as weaklings or firms overburdened by regulatory fines to come.
ING has cleaned up its balance sheet, sold insurance businesses and is cutting funding costs. Credit Agricole has seen its capital base grow strongly, although a lot has come from investment gains in its insurance unit. BNP Paribas has yet to resolve a U.S. dollar-clearing ban that arose from its sanctions busting, but is performing well otherwise and should benefit from ECB monetary actions.
All three are valued at less than 0.9 times book value, while ING and BNP also have unchallenging forward price/earnings ratios of about 10 times. Credit Agricole trades at 11.5 times forward earnings, but has a lower book value multiple of 0.6 times.
A credible-enough stress-test result could see these kinds of banks rerated. If BNP's valuation moves up to the multiple of J.P. Morgan Chase's at about 0.94 times, for example, that would lift BNP's shares more than 30%.
Investors with a higher risk appetite also could look at weaker banks that might still pass, especially if hedge funds have bet heavily against those stocks. Their prices could leap if investors are forced to buy back stock to cover those short wagers.
Portugal's Banco Comercial Portugues and smaller Spanish banks like Sabadell and Banco Popular Espanol have heavy so-called short interest, according to data from Markit Group. Notably, the second-most-shorted bank stock in the Stoxx 600 is ING.
Beyond the stress tests, Europe still faces low economic growth and low interest rates, so it will be some time before banks see lending and interest-income growth. Then again, things have been so desperate that any signs of life would be good. And, should credible stress tests relieve capital concerns, European bank stocks will be looked at in a different way.

BOE's Gloomier Outlook
Challenges U.K. Debt Bet
A bet that yields on U.K. and German government bonds would diverge has been a profitable strategy as markets increasingly priced in a strong U.K. recovery versus a lackluster eurozone performance. The latest Bank of England minutes, published Wednesday, show why that wager may be running out of steam.
The trade has worked ever since September 2012, when yields on 10-year U.K. gilts and German bunds were virtually level at around 1.55%, according to FactSet data. Since then, bund yields have fallen to 0.84% while gilt yields have risen to 2.22%. Since bond yields and prices move in inverse relation, this means gilt prices have fallen while those of bunds have risen.
But recent market volatility has taken its toll. The gap between the benchmark instruments has tightened from its widest level above 1.5 percentage points in September, when gilt yields hit 2.57%.
And there is growing reason to believe that the yield gap will have a tough time widening as significantly again. Inflation in the U.K. declined unexpectedly to 1.2% in September, well below the BOE's 2% target. And while the U.K. economy is expected to continue to grow, the pace may slow somewhat.
The third-quarter reading for U.K. growth, due Friday, will be closely watched in this regard. It isn't clear how well the U.K. can withstand weak growth in Europe and emerging markets.
The latest BOE minutes underline this. True, two members of the Monetary Policy Committee, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, continued to vote for a 0.25-percentage-point rate increase. That was despite the fact the committee knew the low inflation number when it met.
But the other seven committee members seemed to be more concerned about global developments and a lack of domestic inflationary pressures. BOE chief economist Andrew Haldane last week noted that his view of the economy was "gloomier" than a few months ago. Wage inflation seems likely to be the key factor to watch. So far, it has been notable by its absence.
The somewhat weaker outlook for the U.K. is a problem for the gilt-bund trade. Set against that, the eurozone position looks much more worrying. The ECB is still under pressure to loosen policy further; the U.K., by contrast, is still looking at rate increases, albeit starting later than the market thought until recently.
So the yield gap could widen again. But the big money likely has been made on this trade already.

Samsung Finds Strength in Family
It is time to stop thinking of Samsung Electronics as a smartphone company.
Samsung's runaway success the past few years in smartphones had investors wondering if the South Korean giant could become the next Apple. That seems increasingly unlikely. But Samsung's leading position in less sexy chips, displays and other parts, plus its cheap valuation, still make it a company worth owning.
Samsung's mobile division, dominated by smartphones, brought in more than two-thirds of the company's operating profit last year, up from just around one-quarter in 2010. Yet that era of smartphone dominance was short-lived. The mobile division was likely the main culprit behind the company's forecast for a 60% decline in third-quarter operating profit. Shares are down nearly 20% this year.
There seems little prospect of a smartphone turnaround in the near future, given intense competition at the high end from Apple. At the low end is heat from Chinese handset makers.
The outlook is less gloomy for Samsung's components businesses. In memory chips, it is the leader in both technology and in terms of scale in an industry once riven by competition, but now consolidated to just a handful of profitable players.
The stock looks cheap at eight times forward earnings and 1.1 times book value, below the 10-year averages of 10 times earnings and 1.7 times book. Back out $44.4 billion of net cash, and it trades at just six times forward earnings.
Even assuming Samsung's mobile business is worthless, which it isn't, the stock looks undervalued. Putting the chip business at two times book value -- a discount to rivals, which trade at an average of nearly three times -- and adding Samsung's cash and investments, leaves a higher valuation than the current market capitalization, notes Mark Newman of Bernstein Research.
In fact, Samsung has been cheap, at around eight times earnings or below, since the middle of 2012, even before the smartphone business peaked. What is missing is a catalyst to unlock value.
Investors have agitated for the company to return more of its massive cash reserves to boost the stock. Samsung had hinted for months that it would unveil a detailed plan to send more cash to shareholders with its first-half results, only to backtrack in July, saying it needed more time.
This foot-dragging is partially explained by the stock's true problem: the convoluted structure through which the Lee family controls the broader Samsung empire. Since family patriarch Lee Kun-hee was hospitalized with a heart attack earlier this year, his children appear to have started work on an opaque plan to rearrange assets.
One likely objective is to consolidate control over crown jewel Samsung Electronics, in which Lee family members hold only a small direct stake. This means they would benefit little from a distribution of cash to shareholders before the reshuffle.
Similarly, Mr. Lee's heirs face a 50% inheritance tax on his stake in Samsung Electronics. There is little incentive for them to boost the share price beforehand.
Samsung's smartphone woes look set to continue. But bright prospects for its other business aren't reflected in the share price. For now, investors will have to wait for that value to be unlocked by the Lee family.

Overheard
Gold and platinum are prized for their rarity. What is happening with their prices right now is also pretty unusual.
At about $1,245 an ounce, gold isn't far off parity with platinum at about $1,270. This doesn't happen often. In the past 20 years, gold has matched or exceeded the platinum price only about 7% of the time. And much of that occurred between the summer of 2011 and early 2013, when quantitative easing was in full swing and hyperbole about the dollar's demise was at its height.
Similarly, the current price action reflects an anxious world. Gold hasn't really gained much this year; rather, platinum has collapsed since July. This makes sense. as more than half of platinum demand relates to industrial, primarily, automotive uses. Deflation fears have hurthave industrial commodities.
Gold usually benefits when such extreme scenarios seem plausible. There is one twist: Negative inflation would imply rising real interest rates. The latter erode the case for holding nonyielding assets such as precious metals. Even so, the rare melding of gold and platinum prices is an unwelcome sign that optimism about growth is rapidly becoming the rarest commodity of all.

* Gemalto reports Q3 revenue below expectations
* SIM card & payment security firm reasserts long-term goals
* CEO says market "overreacted" to Apple SIM card announcement (Adds CEO comments, detail)
By Nicholas Vinocur
Oct 22 (Reuters) - Gemalto NV, the Franco-Dutch digital security company that makes smart chips for mobile phones, bank cards and biometric passports, reiterated long-term revenue and profit targets on Thursday and said Apple's move to pre-install its own SIM cards in iPads did not threaten its business, as third-quarter revenue came in below expectations.
The company said it would still achieve a double-digit growth rate in its profit from operations for the full year as well as faster revenue growth in the rest of 2014.
Third-quarter revenue was 626 million euros($791.70 million) on a constant currency basis, helped by growth in EMV payment cards. However, it was below average analyst expectations for revenue of 661 million euros.
Gemalto shares slumped this week after Apple announced that new tablets sold in the United States would be equipped with its own SIM cards for connecting to mobile phone networks, which some analysts said could rob Gemalto of revenue.
Gemalto's CEO Olivier Piou said he had struggled to understand the market's reaction as SIM cards only made up a small fraction of Gemalto's revenue and that greater use of payment chips in general was good for the brand.
"Every time Apple makes an announcement there's an overreaction, but this time, it was more surprising," he said. "The more the market grows... for (payment) security hardware, the more those things need to be administered, and the more Gemalto is able to profit."
Piou added that Gemalto would profit from U.S. government decisions to make all public bodies use two-step authentication procedures - which Gemalto administers - and make all public financial institutions take standard EMV payment cards.
EMV is a fraud-reducing technology built into payment cards with a smart chip.
Analysts said Gemalto's long-term targets "looked "optimistic".
"While Gemalto continues to expect double-digit growth in EBIT for the full-year 2014, we would argue that it remains optimistic given weakness on the top line," Credit Suisse said in a research note.
Piou said part of the shortfall had to do with the delayed roll-out of World Bank development programmes in Western Africa, due to the outbreak of the Ebola virus, which in turn had cut into Gemalto's predicted revenue.
Gemalto's revenue from payment and identity products grew by 12 percent to 289.2 million euros on a constant currency basis.
Chief Executive Olivier Piou said in a statement that Gemalto's EMV revenues in the United States tripled and Asia grew by 18 percent, adding that the company's pace of growth accelerated during the third quarter.
The group reaffirmed its profit forecasts for the years ahead that it made in August along with the announcement of the acquisition of U.S.-based data protection specialist SafeNet for $890 million.
Gemalto reaffirmed that the deal should allow it to raise its 2017 target for profit from operations of 600 million euros by 10 percent. (U.S. $1 = 0.7907 euros) (Reporting by Aurindom Mukherjee in Bangalore & Nicholas Vinocur in Paris; Editing by Leslie Adler and Greg Mahlich)

Amazon.com Inc. had what seemed like a mixed day on July 24: It unveiled disappointing second-quarter earnings, but it also began selling its much-anticipated Fire phone.
It now looks like the company got badly burned by its handset ambitions. Despite what appears to be an epic flop, in addition to bad publicity from its tiff with a major publisher and tax issues in Europe, investors seem sanguine. The stock has now recovered from the 10% drop following the July 24 release.
Assuming the bar has been set low enough for third-quarter results, due Thursday, investors should avoid a fourth consecutive tumble following an earnings report. Analysts expect a per-share loss of 75 cents compared with a loss of nine cents a year earlier. Expectations have dropped steadily from a forecast of a 38-cent profit a year ago.
Calling market reaction to Amazon's earnings rash is an understatement. The average change in its shares in the session following an earnings release has been 9% since 2007. Happily, there have been about twice as many pops as drops.
Investors' reaction has had much to do with whether they chose to focus on surging sales or minuscule profits. Amazon expects third-quarter revenue to be 15% to 26% higher than a year before, probably satisfying those watching the top line.
So with the stock down by more than one-fifth in the year to date, is it a temporary bargain or grossly expensive?
That hinges partly on what exactly Amazon is: part megaretailer like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., part bookseller like Barnes & Noble Inc., part phone-and-tablet maker like Apple Inc., part fee-supported shopping club like Costco Wholesale Corp., part cloud-services provider like Rackspace Hosting Inc. and part video streaming service like Netflix Inc.
Those companies sport trailing multiples of debt-adjusted market value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of between seven and 13.5 times. On revenue, the range is even wider: 0.5 to 4.1 times. On the earnings measure, Amazon is 220% more expensive than the group, on average. On revenue it is 28% cheaper.
Best-in-class in some fields but certainly not all, Amazon's fans insist profitability could surge if it decides to sacrifice growth. Recent weakness shows the market is finally holding management's feet to the fire.

Huawei says third-quarter smartphone shipments jump 26 percent, strong demand for high-end devices

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd said third-quarter smartphone shipments jumped 26 percent year-on-year, doubling devices shipped to the high-margin premium market dominated by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc.
Shenzhen-based Huawei, the world's third-biggest smartphone supplier after the dominant pair, shipped 16.8 million smartphones globally in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to company data. About a quarter of those were mid- to high-end models, more than twice as many as the same period last year.
"We are breaking our bottlenecks of mid- to high-end models step by step, especially in overseas markets," Huawei consumer business group marketing executive Shao Yang told Reuters in an interview.
Huawei, like Chinese rivals Lenovo Group Ltd and ZTE Corp, is better known for selling low- and mid-priced handsets in emerging markets than high-end models in developed countries.
Industry watchers say that although Huawei's premium devices are cutting-edge, the company has struggled to break into the high-end sector markets like the United States due to a lack of brand recognition and security concerns. Huawei had 6.7 percent of the global smartphone market in the second quarter, a distant third behind Samsung Electronics and Apple, according to analysis firm IDC.
As if to prove a point, Huawei unveiled a smartphone with an advanced sapphire glass display just days before Apple released its highly anticipated iPhone 6 in September.
"We have never questioned our ability to make products, but sometimes we are worried if we could occupy a place emotionally in consumers' hearts. So we will try to achieve that next year," Shao said.
Huawei's global marketing budget would leap at least 30 percent in 2015, compared with $440 million this year, he said.
The company has shipped 51 million smartphones globally in the first three quarters of 2014 - about 63.8 percent of its annual shipment target of 80 million, according to Reuters' calculations, based on figures provided by Huawei.
Shao said he expected quarter-on-quarter shipments growth of up to 80 percent in the fourth quarter, a peak holiday season for smartphone vendors.
A little more than half of Huawei's smartphone shipments went to China in the third quarter. Elsewhere, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific recorded the strongest growth.

(Adds context, details of Cook's visit)
BEIJING, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company is planning to open 25 retail stores in China within the next two years, according to a Chinese transcript of an interview posted by web portal Sina.com.
Apple, which currently earns about 15 percent of its revenue in Greater China, has 15 outlets in the country. The Apple chief executive made similar comments Monday on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.
"We're investing like crazy in the market," Cook said on the call. "When I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are more people graduating into the middle class than any nation on Earth in history."
Cook is visiting China, where he has toured Foxconn Technology Co's iPhone factory in Zhengzhou and looked at local retail operations.
On Wednesday, Cook met with China's Vice Minister Ma Kai, where the two exchanged views on "protection of users' information" as well as "strengthening cooperation," according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
On Friday, Cook will attend meetings at Beijing's Tsinghua University as a member of the School of Economics and Management's advisory council. He will be joined there by Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook Inc founder, and other global business leaders.
The Apple chief also said the company is cooperating with Chinese firms including Baidu Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to today's online transcript.
Cook also said he will meet with Jack Ma, Alibaba's chairman, on Monday. (Reporting by Matthew Miller; Editing by Stephen Coates and Ryan Woo)

Can You Trust That Web Price?

The Web is full of personalized content, whether it's a Netflix recommendation or the results of a Google search.
But consumers have protested when e-commerce companies have extended their behind-the-scenes personalization to prices, charging different sums for the same goods, or pushing some people toward higher-priced offers.
A new study of top e-commerce websites found these practices -- called discriminatory pricing or price steering -- are much more widespread than was previously understood.
The study, by a team of computer scientists at Northeastern University, tracked searches on 16 popular e-commerce sites. Six of those sites used the pricing techniques; none of the sites alerted consumers to that fact.
Among the study's findings: Travel-booking sites Cheaptickets and Orbitz charged some users searching hotel rates an average $12 more per night if they weren't logged into the sites, and Travelocity charged users of Apple Inc.'s iOS mobile operating system $15 less for hotels than other users.
Home Depot Inc. shows mobile-device users products that are roughly $100 more expensive than those offered to desktop-computer users. And Expedia and Hotels.com steer users at random to pricier products, the study said.
"In the real world, there are coupons and loyalty cards, and people are fine with that," said Christo Wilson, an assistant professor at Northeastern who led the research team. "Here, there's a transparency problem. The algorithms change regularly, so you don't know if other people are getting the same results."
Travelocity, a unit of Sabre Corp., didn't respond to a request for comment.
Home Depot didn't dispute the accuracy of the findings, but the home-improvement retailer wasn't "intentionally steering search results," said company spokesman Stephen Holmes.
Many factors could influence what a customer sees on the company's sites, Mr. Holmes said, including prior browsing and purchase history, the location of the store, and whether the customer is on mobile or not.
Home Depot didn't charge users different prices for identical products but showed more-expensive products to people who shopped using a smartphone, the researchers found.
Chris Chiames, vice president of corporate affairs at Orbitz Worldwide Inc., said in an email that the company clearly advertises its loyalty programs and other deals. He said the discounts some members see on the site apply to just a small proportion of hotels -- fewer than 5%. So, it wouldn't make sense, and might even be misleading, to advertise lower prices to all members, he said.
"The Northeastern study states that 'overall, most of the experiments do not reveal evidence of steering or discrimination,' and so we are curious as to why a handful of exceptions to searches on thousands of hotels is the basis of this paper's conclusions, or even worthy of a story," Mr. Chiames added. "Would you be as interested in a Kmart 'blue light special' deal that was made available to shoppers who happen to be in a certain store at a certain time?"
Moreover, some deals are priced by Orbitz's hotel partners, he added. "The hotel might have limited inventory of that price, and so they choose to display the rate on a more-limited basis, akin to the flash sale," he said.
On Orbitz and Cheaptickets, also owned by Orbitz Worldwide, consumers who registered through the websites' free log-in were shown a tab labeled "members only" that offered lower hotel prices. The company didn't advertise that users could receive discounts for logging in.
Orbitz has been accused of price discrimination in the past. A 2012 Wall Street Journal investigation found the company charged Mac users as much as 30% more than PC users for a night's lodging.
The company discontinued the practice, which it characterized as a month-long experiment. The Northeastern researchers confirmed the company no longer discriminates between Mac and PC users.
Expedia and Hotels.com, both units of Expedia Inc., don't show different prices because of users' differing characteristics but because the company constantly refines its pricing strategies using a method called A/B testing, the researchers said. Shoppers are randomly placed in a group that highlights either less or more costly hotels. "Either way, the user has no idea what bucket they've been placed in," said Northeastern's Mr. Wilson.
One group of users, for example, were shown an average hotel listing price of $187 a night. The other group saw prices that were $17, or roughly 10%, less.
"Presenting different booking paths and options to different customers allows us to determine which features customers appreciate most" said Expedia spokesman Dave McNamee, in an email. "Pricing is not manipulated by Expedia.com."
Consumers have long protested price discrimination. In 2000, Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos apologized for an internal research program in which consumers were shown different prices for identical products. He called the experiment a "mistake." (Amazon and eBay Inc. weren't included in the Northeastern study because those companies' services have little power over the prices they charge, the researchers said.)
Staples Inc. varied its online prices based on users' locations, according to a 2012 article in The Wall Street Journal. The researchers didn't examine Staples but pointed out that retailers might vary prices by region because the cost of procuring a given product can differ in different parts of the country. They didn't study geographic variations for that reason.
In their study, the Northeastern researchers devised a statistical method to weed out what they called "noise," or legitimate factors that might cause prices to vary.
The research team recruited 300 beta users, who allowed the researchers to track their experience on different sites.
The team also developed hundreds of fake accounts to see whether historical purchase patterns and clicks through the sites had an impact on price personalization.

Conductor Chailly: Appeasing La Scala's 'gods' with Italian opera
Italian conductor Riccardo Chailly knows that Milan's legendary La Scala opera house, where he takes over as principal conductor in January, is a political and cultural pressure cooker. So he's going to give the public what it wants: Italian opera. That might seem like a no-brainer - Italian opera in Italy's most famous opera house. But outgoing music director Daniel Barenboim riled some of the famously opinionated La Scala audience by opening the 2012-2013 season - a joint 200th birthday year for Germany's Richard Wagner and Italy's Giuseppe Verdi - with Wagner's "Lohengrin".
U2 album stumbles in Billboard chart after free iTunes debut

SEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix Inc said on Thursday its third-quarter operating profit rose 11.7 percent from a year earlier, backed by firm memory chip demand from personal computers as well as the launch of new smartphone products.
The world's second-largest memory chip maker reported 1.3 trillion won ($1.24 billion) in operating profit for the July-September quarter, matching the mean forecast of 1.3 trillion won in a poll of 36 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company had guided for slower sequential shipments growth for both DRAM and NAND chips in the quarter, though it expected market conditions to remain favourable thanks to firm demand for personal computers and servers.
Launch of new smartphones such as Apple Inc's new iPhones were also expected to help sales for SK Hynix. (1 US dollar = 1,052.4100 Korean won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Michael Perry) )

Corporate News: At Sony, Hopes Dim For Its Smartphones

TOKYO -- Sony Corp. is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, as the business struggles in the face of fierce competition -- especially in emerging markets.
The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43 million for the 12 months ending March 2015, those people said. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50 million, which many analysts said at the time was too optimistic.
The expected revision stems from Sony's plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets.
Sony disappointed investors in September when it announced it would write down 180 billion yen ($1.68 billion) of the smartphone segment's business value and forecast a 230 billion yen net loss for the current business year -- almost five times what it previously expected.
For Sony watchers, the latest plan won't come as much of a surprise, as company executives, including Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, have signaled a downsizing of the smartphone business in some countries after concluding that introducing entry-level models for emerging markets was a mistake. Sony plans to hold a meeting with investors in November, and Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said details of how it will update the smartphone business plan would be unveiled there.
Sony's Xperia smartphone business was once a star player for the company, but is now experiencing trouble. It has been hit by the emergence of Chinese makers of cheap handsets, while it continues to struggle in competition against market leaders Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.
The Xperia will remain a core business for the company along with image sensors and the gaming business, but Mr. Yoshida has said at news conferences that the smartphone segment will focus on high-end models and won't seek a major share of the global market.
Mr. Hirai said in September that Sony would cut 1,000 jobs, or 15% of its global smartphone business workforce, by March. Some analysts said the cuts weren't enough to turn around the segment.
Sony is to announce its results for the July-September period on Oct. 31. While analysts expect a net loss due to the 180 billion yen smartphone charges, they say it is unlikely the company would again revise its earnings forecast lower for the year.
New York hedge-fund firm Third Point LLC, which unsuccessfully sought a partial spinoff of Sony's entertainment business, said Tuesday said that it had sold its stake in Sony for a return of nearly 20%, saying in a letter to its investors that "more urgency" was necessary to "definitively turn around the company's fortunes."

Samsung's runaway success the past few years in smartphones had investors wondering if the South Korean giant could become the next Apple. That seems increasingly unlikely. But Samsung's leading position in less sexy chips, displays and other parts, plus its cheap valuation, still make it a company worth owning.
Samsung's mobile division, dominated by smartphones, brought in more than two-thirds of the company's operating profit last year, up from just around a quarter in 2010. Yet that era of smartphone dominance was short-lived. The mobile division was likely the main culprit behind the company's forecast for a 60% decline in third-quarter operating profit. Shares are down nearly 20% this year.
There seems little prospect of a smartphone turnaround in the near future, given intense competition at the high end from Apple. At the low end is heat from Chinese handset makers that rely on the same Android operating system Samsung uses.
The outlook is less gloomy for Samsung's components businesses. In memory chips, it is the leader in both technology and in terms of scale in an industry once riven by competition, but now consolidated to just a handful of profitable players.
In logic chips, Samsung lost a major customer when Apple switched over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for its iPhones. But Samsung is ahead of TSMC in the next generation of smaller-transistor chips, and analysts predict it will win back some Apple orders next year. Similarly in displays, Samsung is at the technological forefront with organic light-emitting diode technology.
The stock looks cheap at eight times forward earnings and 1.1 times book value, below the 10-year averages of 10 times earnings and 1.7 times book. Back out $44.4 billion of net cash, and it trades at just six times forward earnings.
Even assuming Samsung's mobile business is worthless, which it isn't, the stock looks undervalued. Putting the chip business at two times book value -- a discount to rivals, which trade at an average of nearly three times -- and adding Samsung's cash and investments, leaves a higher valuation than the current market capitalization, notes Mark Newman of Bernstein Research.
In fact, Samsung has been cheap, at around eight times earnings or below, since the middle of 2012, even before the smartphone business peaked. What is missing is a catalyst to unlock value.
Investors have agitated for the company to return more of its massive cash reserves to boost the stock. Samsung had hinted for months that it would unveil a detailed plan to send more cash to shareholders with its first-half results, only to backtrack in July, saying it needed more time.
This foot-dragging is partially explained by the stock's true problem: the convoluted structure through which the Lee family controls the broader Samsung empire. Since family patriarch Lee Kun-hee was hospitalized with a heart attack earlier this year, his children appear to have started work on an opaque plan to rearrange assets.
One likely objective is to consolidate control over crown jewel Samsung Electronics, in which Lee family members hold only a small direct stake. This means they would benefit little from a distribution of cash to shareholders before the reshuffle.
Similarly, Mr. Lee's heirs face a 50% inheritance tax on his stake in Samsung Electronics. There is little incentive for them to boost the share price beforehand.
Samsung's smartphone woes look set to continue. But bright prospects for its other business aren't reflected in the share price. For now, investors will have to wait for that value to be unlocked by the Lee family.

The Clock Ticks as Yahoo
Searches for Some Answers
Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has bought herself some time. But the clock is still ticking.
Yahoo reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday. Revenue rose 1% versus a year earlier. That is paltry for a tech company but still better than year-over-year declines seen in some recent quarters.
Notably, the company broke out its mobile revenue for the first time, saying it came in at $200 million in the quarter. It also forecast gross mobile revenue of $1.2 billion this year.
That is a major shift. And Yahoo said mobile, social, native and video ads rose a combined 80% year over year. The gains appear to be helping offset declines in Yahoo's traditional display-ad business.
Yet they also may raise eyebrows. Yahoo offered few details on how it accomplished such a sizable swing. The company previously had declined to break out mobile revenue, saying it wasn't material to results.
As well, Yahoo's $1.2 billion forecast amounts to nearly 28% of analysts' consensus estimates for 2014 revenue. That seems to require Yahoo to shift revenue to mobile at an even faster pace in the fourth quarter.
Perhaps more important, Yahoo gave few answers on how it planned to use the net $6.3 billion in cash it got from selling shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding when that company went public last month. Instead, Ms. Mayer defended her acquisition track record and highlighted the $7.7 billion in shares Yahoo has bought back during her tenure.
Yahoo also kicked the can down the road on its strategy for reducing the tax bill on the stakes of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan it continues to own.
Things at Yahoo don't seem to be getting worse. But it is too soon to call them better.

When the cat's away, the mice will trade.
Recent years haven't been kind to stock analysts. Fair-disclosure rules led investors to see less value in Wall Street research. Regulatory scrutiny gave firms more reason to rethink research. From 2000 to 2008, 43 brokers closed research departments. But for chief executives and other corporate insiders looking to trade their companies' shares, this was a boon, suggests research from Wei Wu, a graduate student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Mr. Wu looked at trading behavior of insiders at companies with five or fewer analysts when, as a result of research-department closures, coverage was reduced. He found for each analyst a company lost, returns reaped by insiders increased. Mr. Wu's favored explanation: Important information that would otherwise have been transmitted to investors was lost, increasing trading opportunities for insiders.
Another possibility is that with fewer analysts monitoring the company, insiders felt they had a freer hand to trade.

Asian Pacific Stocks: Nikkei Gains 2.6%; Hong Kong Climbs

Japanese stocks surged for a second time this week, rebounding from a drop Tuesday, while Hong Kong shares gained for a fourth straight day after the government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks for the first time Tuesday.
Asian markets got a boost from a sharp rise in Wall Street shares overnight, driven by strong quarterly results from Apple and news that the European Central Bank is considering further stimulus.
The Nikkei Stock Average led gains in the region, jumping 2.6% to 15195.77, as the dollar moved back above 107 yen.
The latest read on Japanese exports showed a rise of 6.9% from a year earlier in September, helped by a weaker yen and a surge in output among suppliers of components for Apple's new smartphones. Still, Japan's trade deficit edged up 1.6% from a year earlier to 958.3 billion yen ($8.96 billion), the first increase in three months.
Stocks in Japan have had a rough run lately, with big declines last week sending the Nikkei into correction territory, down more than 10% from a late-September peak. On Tuesday the Nikkei lost 2%, after it gained 4% Monday.
The Nikkei tends to rise when the yen falls, because a weaker yen is generally positive for earnings at Japan's exporters. The dollar has backtracked against the yen in October after gaining earlier in the year. Midday Wednesday in New York, the greenback was at 107.28 yen, up from 107 yen late Tuesday.
Shares of Japanese shippers were strong, as the Baltic Dry Index of freight rates rose for a third straight session to a one-month high. Nippon Yusen added 4.3% and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines gained 5.4%.
Sony rose 3.4% after reports it will exit its low-end, emerging-market-oriented smartphone business and on news that activist investor Third Point had sold its Sony stock.
Fujifilm Holdings gained 4.1% after a Nikkei report that the company is likely to book a 20% on-year rise in group operating profit for the April-September fiscal half, to around 70 billion yen, as its digital camera business moved out of the red. The firm is also enjoying positive exposure as the developer of Avigan, currently in demand as an Ebola treatment.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to 23403.97, pushing it to a month-to-date gain of 2.05% despite protests that have hurt the city's retailers and other businesses.
The government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks Tuesday, but there was no agreement over how the city's chief executive should be elected.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.1% to 5385.90, its seventh consecutive rise, putting the index back in positive territory for the year.
BHP Billiton was up 1.5% after the company reported strong petroleum and metallurgical-coal production and solid iron-ore output figures for the September quarter. Rio Tinto gained 2.1%, while fellow iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals added 3.1%.
Australia's largest banks all advanced, climbing between 0.5% and 1.3%. The earnings season for the lenders kicks off next week with National Australia Bank's full-year results.
South Korea's Kospi climbed 1.1% to 1936.97. Hyundai Motor fell 4.2% ahead of its third-quarter report. The firm is expected to post a net profit of 1.87 trillion won ($1.77 billion), down 17% from a year earlier, according to a Wall Street Journal poll.
In India, the S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.8% to 26787.23, its fourth straight rise.

World News: Hong Kong: Hong Kong Media Diverge Over Coverage of Protests

HONG KONG -- As Hong Kong lumbers through its fourth week of pro-democracy protests, the variety of coverage in the local media has laid bare differences in visions for the city's future.
Hong Kong has free-speech protections not available on the mainland, and the territory's 18 daily newspapers and multiple television and radio channels have given the student-led protests wall-to-wall coverage, airing multiple -- often clashing -- viewpoints.
On one side are pro-Beijing newspapers like Ta Kung Pao, which portrays the protests as illegal and unruly. On the other is Apple Daily, which is known for a strident anti-Beijing stance and has long backed calls for a democratic procedure to select the city's politicians.
"You have a spectrum," said Yuen-Ying Chan, director of the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong. "Between them, you try to find the truth."
The split has been clear in the coverage of events. Last week, the beating of a demonstrator by Hong Kong police was caught on video and led to the suspension of the officers allegedly involved. The incident led to diverging news reports.
Apple Daily splashed "Seven Demon Police Surround and Beat Protester for Four Minutes" across its front page, accompanied by photos of the demonstrator's bruised back and face.
Ta Kung Pao focused on what it called the violent behavior of protesters, whom police had been trying to clear from a tunnel before the beating. "Police Assaulted," one of the headlines read, while another labeled protesters "Roadside Despots."
The student-led protesters want anyone to be able to stand for the city's first democratic elections, slated for 2017. China's government ruled this summer that candidates must first be screened by a nominating committee largely loyal to Beijing.
Students took to the streets in late September, blocking major intersections. They gained support from some residents and condemnation from others. There have been few surveys on support for the protests, leaving media outlets as a battleground for public opinion.
While battle lines have long been drawn between papers like Ta Kung Pao and Apple Daily, free-speech advocates say they are uneasy about the dominance of other mainstream newspapers by tycoons with business interests in China. "The temptation, of course, is to not offend mainland China," Ms. Chan said.
Ming Pao is owned by Malaysian timber tycoon Tiong Hiew King; the English-language South China Morning Post is owned by Malaysia's Kuok family, whose interests include agribusiness and hotels; while Richard Li, son of Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, owns the Hong Kong Economic Journal and a pay-TV channel.
Alice Kwok, the chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal, said she didn't feel any pressure from Beijing on how to cover the protests. Ming Pao and the South China Morning Post declined to comment. Ta Kung Pao didn't respond to requests to comment.
Apple Daily -- whose owner, Jimmy Lai, says he has no business dealings in mainland China -- perhaps has faced the most difficulties during the protests.
The newspaper has experienced attacks on its website and demonstrations by pro-Beijing groups outside a complex containing its headquarters and printing plant, delaying the distribution of newspapers.
Officials at Next Media, Apple Daily's parent company, said sales of print copies have increased during the protests. Mr. Lai, a businessman who founded the newspaper in the 1990s, has shrugged off the attacks. "We don't feel any threat," Mr. Lai said. "They are just nuisances."

World News: Hong Kong: Occupy Students Settle Into a Routine

HONG KONG -- When saxophone player Kenny G showed up at the main protest site in Hong Kong on Wednesday, it was an amusing break in the daily routine that has emerged as students settle in for what they say will be a long stay on the streets.
At the main occupation site outside the city's government headquarters, a colorful sea of 1,500 tents has expanded to cover a highway, overpasses, sidewalks and a park, surrounded at nearly every entrance with piles of metal and bamboo barricades designed to keep police out.
In contrast to clashes with police as recently as this weekend in one of the two smaller protest areas, the largest site has been peaceful for a week and has taken on the air of a campground. Protesters read and sleep during the day and are joined by office workers who eat their lunches in a rare open, quiet space in the densely populated city.
The government and students held their first talks in the three-and-a-half-week dispute on Tuesday with neither side budging from their positions. The students are calling for Hong Kong to freely elect its next leader in 2017. The government insists that is impossible under a constitution established with Beijing. No new talks are scheduled.
"The government is not willing to listen, so we will stay here," said 27-year-old theater-worker Harry Pang, sitting beside two yellow and blue tents he pitched in a shady area by Tamar Park, next to the government offices. He has been sleeping at the site for two weeks.
The protest site in the city's Admiralty district, a maze of central government offices, bus stops and the upscale Pacific Place shopping mall, draws crowds after work on warm evenings. Student leaders appear nightly on a rudimentary stage, giving speeches and rallying supporters of a movement that until last week had been waning.
The first public-opinion poll released since the protest began showed increasing support for the students and less support for their opponents. The poll by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that 38% of respondents supported the protesters in October, up from 31.5% in September. More significantly, the portion of the population that doesn't support the protesters dropped to 36% from 46% in September.
The poll of 802 people was taken Oct. 8-15, just over a week after the occupation began on Sept. 28 when police fired tear gas at protesters. In the week since the polling ended, support may have declined as the inconveniences of blocked roads weigh on the public. The poll also said that 53.6% of respondents considered the use of tear gas by the police not appropriate, while 22% said it was appropriate.
Kenny G's appearance isn't the only one by a celebrity, but it was the only one to draw comment from the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing. The saxophonist, who is popular in China, tweeted a photo of himself from the site wishing "everyone a peaceful and positive conclusion to this situation."
Asked about the appearance of the American musician, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, "I don't have a specific grasp of the situation regarding the American citizen you raise who is in Hong Kong participating in the illegal Occupy Central."
At the main protest site, banners hang from bridges and walls are covered with colored Post-it Notes offering support. Some of the tents have names that mock Hong Kong luxury developments and one has a sign appealing to passersby: "If something happens, please wake me up." Young couples take advantage of the freedom from crowded family apartments for romance.
Hong Kong media executive Jimmy Lai, founder of pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, spends many days at the protest sites and said he thinks the protests could last for as long a year. "People just won't go away if there's no solution from the government," he said.
Teenage members of the Scholarism student group, led by 18-year-old Joshua Wong and one of the three main protest organizers, can often be found at tents pitched directly across from Hong Kong's legislative headquarters known as LegCo. Study tables set up next to the Scholarism tents on Wednesday were littered with cookies and reams of statistics homework.
"The future of Hong Kong affects me," said 19-year-old final-year student Calvin Chau, who said he has been going back to class the past few days at the urging of his father. "The movement is more important than studying at the moment."
A group of the teenagers happily accepted ice cream offered by a passerby on Wednesday morning, and people often bring them rice and noodles. A McDonald's and KFC next to the site are often packed, though protesters complain they are getting sick of the food.
The main protest site has calmed considerably after a night of clashes last week when police allegedly dragged a handcuffed protester around a corner and beat him. The officers have been suspended and after that protest leaders and the victim called for calm.
The scene contrasts with the more riotous Mong Kok protest site across Victoria Harbour, which police cleared last week only to see protesters reoccupy during a weekend of violent confrontations.
Unlike most campgrounds, the bathrooms at the main site are remarkably well-stocked and clean. On Wednesday, a ladies' bathroom in the center of the site was crammed with toothpaste and body wash.

iPad Air 2 Review: The Best Tablet Needs to Work Harder; It Has a Quality Screen and Build but It Needs to Go Beyond One-App-at-a-Time Functionality
By Joanna Stern

When Steve Jobs plopped down on the couch, minutes after showing off the iPad for the first time, he said, ¡§It¡¦s so much more intimate than a laptop and so much more capable than a smartphone.¡¨
Four years later, as I watch the YouTube video of the iPad¡¦s debut keynote on the incredibly thin iPad Air 2, that sentence makes my brain ache. Laptops now have touch screens, smartphones are huge and powerful, and tablets now have keyboards. At least, those tablets made by the competition.
Apple¡¦s newest tablet, which goes on sale this week starting at $499, remains true to Jobs¡¦s tablet ideals. It¡¦s the best tablet you can buy¡Xespecially if you want to read headlines on the morning commute, watch ¡§Frozen¡¨ in the back seat and create intricate ¡§Minecraft¡¨ metropolises after dark. If you¡¦ve been waiting to replace an older iPad, now¡¦s the time.
But as I hold the thin piece of glass that would have been unimaginable five years ago, I look over at the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and feel like I am missing something. How this iPad stacks up depends entirely on where you plan to take it¡Xand what you want to do with it.
Home Alone
There¡¦s still no tablet I¡¦d rather cozy up with in bed or on the couch. In those situations, the 6.1mm Air 2 really lives up to its name.
No, we aren¡¦t at the point where it feels like you¡¦re holding a feather, but there is a substantial difference between grasping the 0.96-pound Air 2 and any of the earlier iPads with one hand. I even noticed a difference between it and last year¡¦s original Air. Apple has squeezed down the svelte case so much that it feels as if you¡¦re holding nothing but a screen.
The iPad Air 2 is also far more manageable than Samsung¡¦s Galaxy Tab S 10.5, and its premium aluminum build and soft curved edges top Samsung¡¦s slimy, dimpled plastic cover.
With the lightweight Air 2, you¡¦re more likely to avoid that always painful iPad-on-the-face-fall when you nod off to sleep on the couch. Still, in most situations the smaller iPad Mini is less cumbersome to hold up.
For the things I do when I¡¦ve got my feet up (read long articles I¡¦ve saved in Pocket, sift through Twitter, watch back-to-back episodes of ¡§How I Met Your Mother¡¨), the iPad still beats the competition. The apps are better and more numerous, and they look great on the Retina display.
And shopping online can only get better with the iPad Air 2¡¦s new Touch ID sensor, as soon as more places allow you to use a finger scan instead of a password or credit-card number. And why hasn¡¦t Apple used Touch ID to create multiple iPad user accounts, since the tablet is so often shared among family members?
The Great Outdoors
The new Air¡¦s display addresses one of my biggest complaints about previous iPads: You can finally see the screen outdoors. A thinner display with an anti-reflective layer means unless the sun is really beating down, there¡¦s no need to pitch a towel tent over the screen while sitting by the pool. (Unfortunately, the new iPad Mini 3 doesn¡¦t have the improved screen.)
In my outdoor test, the Air 2 beat last year¡¦s Air, Samsung¡¦s Tab S and Amazon¡¦s previous Fire HDX, displaying a more even balance under both sunlight and shade. Outdoors, it only loses to a bona fide e-reader like the Kindle Paperwhite. But you¡¦ll still have to crank the brightness all the way up to see the screen in the sun, which will run down the battery faster.
That anti-reflective screen also makes a great, though admittedly ginormous, viewfinder for snapping nature shots with the revamped 8-megapixel camera. It takes much crisper shots than before, and in many cases, ones as good as those I can take with my iPhone 6. But I won¡¦t bring my iPad to some mountain peak, as some Apple promo shots suggest. My phone¡¦s camera is the fastest one for me to grab. And it has a flash for low-light situations and took clearer photos of a speedy pig I met in a New York City park. (Relax, it was on a leash.)
Besides, when I set the iPad Air 2 down for a second on a bench, it slid off and hit concrete, shattering the screen. Sure, I¡¦m to blame, but if Apple wants me to climb every mountain armed with nothing but an iPad, ruggedness should be as important as anti-reflectivity.
Planes, Trains and Automobiles
For commuters and travelers, the good news is the Air 2, despite being 18% thinner than the previous Air, still manages to deliver 10 hours of battery life. I didn¡¦t even take the charger out of the box until after I used the tablet for an entire cross-country flight and then a nonstop morning of checking email and writing.
Battery-wise, when it comes to streaming video, the Air 2 and its greatest Samsung rival are pretty evenly matched. At max brightness¡Xwhere the Air 2¡¦s screen is brighter than the 10.5-inch Galaxy Tab S¡Xthe Samsung lasted nine hours where the iPad ran only six. However, when I set the brightness to 50%, the iPad pulled ahead of the Galaxy. (I recommend using auto brightness unless you really need to step it up.)
Improved wireless connectivity is another boon for road warriors. The Air 2 has a faster wireless chip, which, in my testing, loaded Web pages a hair quicker than its predecessor. The cellular model (which, as usual, costs $130 more than its Wi-Fi counterpart, but has dramatically improved 4G LTE) is pre-installed with an Apple SIM that makes it easier to switch service providers, both domestically and abroad. It should be easier for you to use T-Mobile here in the U.S., then buy some gigabytes on the U.K. wireless carrier EE if you happen to be visiting London.
Career Opportunities
If you¡¦re like me, though, you¡¦ll still lug your laptop on business trips. Even as a basic work companion, the Air 2 doesn¡¦t do nearly enough to keep up with the latest competition.
The new A8X processor provides a performance boost, so the iOS 8 operating system and immersive full-screen apps respond to taps and swipes faster. And while iPad apps in general are superior to the stretched phone apps you too often see on Android tablets, I wish I could see more apps on the screen at the same time, the way I can with a Surface or Galaxy Tab.
I constantly yearned for that functionality while responding to emails about potential meeting times, tapping the home button frenetically to switch to the calendar. I yearned for it as I wrote this column, jumping to the messaging app to update my editor on my progress. I even yearned for it when I wasn¡¦t anywhere near my desk, surfing the Web and attempting to tweet an article.
I¡¦d also really love a better way to type. While I¡¦ve gotten faster on Apple¡¦s latest software keyboard (predictive QuickType helps), I¡¦m far more productive typing on real keys. Microsoft¡¦s $80 Universal Mobile Keyboard is one of the best you can buy, but it won¡¦t prop up the screen well enough¡Xand doesn¡¦t double as a cover.
The iPad Air 2 pushes forward in all the ways you¡¦d expect Apple¡¦s tablet to. The blend of screen, build and app quality make it the best full-size tablet you can buy.
But it doesn¡¦t move ahead in one area where some of us have been waiting (desperately) for evolution: true multi-tasking, going beyond the one-app-at-a-time functionality. Perhaps that¡¦s the big surprise that Apple will bring when it introduces a 12.9-inch iPad next year.
It would be nice to see the iPad get beyond the lean-back experience that¡¦s been the focus since Steve Jobs first sat down on the couch.

Retina iMac Review: The Screen That Makes Desktops Relevant Again; Maximum Pixels in Apple¡¦s 5K Display for the Most Demanding Photo or Video Jobs

I love using a desktop computer to write, surf and create, but I¡¦ve had a nagging suspicion that they¡¦re going away. Who needs a desktop in a world with laptops, tablets and even phones that are just as capable?
Last week Apple introduced a new kind of desktop iMac that changed my mind. The new computer is similar in shape and capability to last year¡¦s iMac, except for one amazing feature: It packs four times the resolution into its 27-inch Retina screen. Because it has so many pixels¡X14.7 million, in fact¡Xyou¡¦ll never need to think about pixels again.
Priced at $2,500 and up, you don¡¦t need this new iMac¡Xstandard 27-inch iMacs start at $700 less. But oh boy will you want one, particularly if you spend time working with digital photos or videos. Using the Retina iMac lets you see, for the first time, every pixel you¡¦ve captured all at once.
And even if you¡¦re just buried in spreadsheets and Web pages, it feels like putting on a new pair of glasses. The Retina iMac makes type, icons and images look like they¡¦ve been printed on the screen, while suffering few performance problems for that herculean effort.
Apple is evolving the idea of a desktop computer, and the reason we make space for one in our offices, kitchens and family rooms. We¡¦re used to thinking about desktop computers as workhorse processors and hubs for all our devices. But as our devices go mobile and our content goes online, desktops serve a different purpose, as workhorse screens. No other form of computer lets you so comfortably peer for hours at a time into a big, immersive window on your digital world. The new iMac is the best, clearest window on your digital world that you can buy.
There¡¦s good reason to be suspicious of claims about increased resolution from tech companies trying to give us a reason to upgrade. TV makers and Hollywood first touted HD (1 million pixels), then full HD (2 million pixels). Today, they¡¦re trying to push us to Ultra HD or 4K (8 million pixels). The Retina iMac has 67% more pixels than even 4K, with a 5120x2880-pixel resolution known as 5K.
The truth is, there¡¦s a point at which the human eye just can¡¦t see these ever-shrinking pixels, and naturally it varies depending on how far away you¡¦re sitting from the screen. This superhigh resolution makes sense on a desktop computer, where you typically sit about two feet away. It isn¡¦t as necessary on a TV that¡¦s 10 feet from your eyes.
Looking at that distance onto a regular iMac, I can clearly see the gray mesh of pixels that makes up words and icons on the screen. On a Retina iMac, which has twice as many pixels per inch, the screen is equally bright. But I only see shapes and colors¡Xno pixels. You do have to sit close, though: Step back another foot or two and the regular and Retina displays look about the same.
You may ask, why not just plug a laptop into a giant 5K monitor? So far, at least, there¡¦s no way to do that. Dell announced its UltraSharp 27 Ultra HD 5K in September, but standard laptops today can¡¦t drive it. Besides, when it ships in December, it will cost $2,500. Apple¡¦s 5K display is available today, and for the same price includes the best personal computer Apple has ever made. Apple¡¦s 15- and 13-inch MacBook Pro laptops also have Retina screens with a similar density of pixels, but the iMac¡¦s screen is much, much larger.
What¡¦s this rarefied display really good for? Can you get it instead of a 4K TV for next-generation 4K movies, TV shows and games? At the moment, no. Netflix doesn¡¦t stream 4K content to the iMac like it does to the most recent Ultra HD TVs, and other sources of 4K video are pretty limited.
When using the Retina iMac for Web browsing and office tasks, menus and type are sharper and brighter. The extra resolution isn¡¦t about packing in more lines of text¡Xmost things remain the same size as they appear on other Macs. However, parts of websites that haven¡¦t been designed for these higher resolutions¡Xlike buttons made out of graphics instead of text¡Xcan look correctly sized but a bit fuzzy.
The Retina iMac is a game-changer for creative types¡Xnot just professionals, but anyone with a fancy digital SLR camera or GoPro video rig. These folks need to see every detail in their shots, and this lets you. It¡¦s got nearly as many pixels as the popular Canon 5D Mark III, and shows an entire 4K video, like the one I made on a GoPro Hero 4, with room to spare.
The moment the Retina iMac became valuable to me was when I opened one of my favorite photos of Rome and realized, for the first time, it¡¦s actually out of focus! Maybe I¡¦m not as good a photographer as I¡¦d thought. But at least now I have the tools to sharpen things up.
On the Retina iMac, using Adobe Photoshop is like editing a printed picture. In fact, I tried that: I loaded a panoramic photo on a regular iMac and a Retina iMac next to a 360-dot-per-inch photo from an Epson Stylus Photo R3000 printer. The colors matched across all three. The old and new iMac screens have the same color profile. But only on the hard copy and the Retina iMac could I make out faraway faces and other rich details that make the shot interesting.
My biggest worry was that the computer would choke while trying to drive all those millions of pixels. But performance wasn¡¦t a problem in my tests loading giant images in Photoshop, flicking through a field of previews in Adobe Lightroom or editing 4K video in Final Cut Pro. I tested the $2,499 base configuration, which has a speedy 3.5Ghz Intel Core i5 processor, Radeon graphics chip and ultrafast Fusion Drive. At this price point, Apple skimps on the memory, just 8 GB, but that can be upgraded to 16 for $200, and 32 for $600.
The most conspicuous thing Apple didn¡¦t build into its latest iMac screens is touch control. The company made touch screens go mainstream with the iPhone and iPad, so why not with personal computers? Microsoft does for devices running Windows 8. For one, Apple¡¦s Yosemite operating system is still designed for control with a precision instrument like a mouse or trackpad. In the past, Apple executives have argued that it would cause ¡§gorilla-arm¡¨ fatigue to control a vertical display with your hands, not to mention leave 27 inches of grubby fingerprints for you to worry about cleaning off.
But a touch screen wouldn¡¦t be a reason to buy a Retina iMac, anyway. You¡¦d get one because it will usher you into the post-pixel computing experience where you¡¦ll see things you¡¦ve never seen before. For an amateur¡Xand sometimes blurry¡Xphotographer like me, the advantages of the display justify the price.

Nikkei Leads Rally in Asian Markets; Shares Jump Following Strong Gains on Wall Street

Japanese stocks surged for a second time this week, rebounding from a big drop Tuesday, while Hong Kong shares gained for a fourth straight day after the government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks for the first time Tuesday.
Asian markets got a boost from a sharp rise in Wall Street shares overnight, driven by strong quarterly results from Apple and news that the European Central Bank is considering further stimulus.
The Nikkei Stock Average led gains in the region, jumping 2.6% to 15195.77, as the dollar moved back above ?107.
The latest read on Japanese exports showed a rise of 6.9% from a year earlier in September, helped by a weaker yen and a surge in output among suppliers of components for Apple¡¦s new smartphones. Still, Japan¡¦s trade deficit edged up 1.6% from a year earlier to ?958.3 billion ($8.96 billion), the first increase in three months.
Stocks in Japan have had a rough run lately, with big declines last week sending the Nikkei into correction territory, down more than 10% from a late-September peak. On Tuesday the Nikkei lost 2%, after it gained 4% Monday.
The Nikkei tends to rise when the yen falls, because a weaker yen is generally positive for earnings at Japan¡¦s exporters. The dollar has backtracked against the yen in October after gaining earlier in the year. Midday Wednesday in New York, the greenback was at ?107.28, up from ?107 late Tuesday.
Shares of Japanese shippers were strong, as the Baltic Dry Index of freight rates rose for a third straight session to a one-month high. Nippon Yusen added 4.3% and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines gained 5.4%.
Sony rose 3.4% following reports it will exit its low-end, emerging-market-oriented smartphone business and on news that activist investor Third Point had sold its Sony stock.
Fujifilm Holdings gained 4.1% after a Nikkei report that the company is likely to book a 20% on-year rise in group operating profit for the April-September fiscal half, to around ?70 billion, as its digital camera business moved out of the red. The firm is also enjoying positive exposure as the developer of Avigan, currently in demand as an Ebola treatment.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to 23403.97, pushing it to a month-to-date gain of 2.05% despite protests that have hurt the city¡¦s retailers and other businesses.
The government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks Tuesday, but there was no agreement over how the city¡¦s chief executive should be elected.
Australia¡¦s S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.1% to 5385.90, its seventh consecutive rise, putting the index back in positive territory for the year.
BHP Billiton was up 1.5% after the company reported strong petroleum and metallurgical-coal production and solid iron-ore output figures for the September quarter. Rio Tinto gained 2.1%, while fellow iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals added 3.1%.
Australia¡¦s largest banks all advanced, climbing between 0.5% and 1.3%. The earnings season for the lenders kicks off next week with National Australia Bank¡¦s full-year results.
South Korea¡¦s Kospi climbed 1.1% to 1936.97.
Hyundai Motor fell 4.2% ahead of its third-quarter report. The firm is expected to post a net profit of 1.87 trillion won ($1.77 billion), down 17% from a year earlier, while sales likely fell 12% to 20.57 trillion won, according to a Wall Street Journal poll.
In India, the S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.8% to 26787.23, its fourth straight rise.

Samsung Finds Strength in Family of Products; Electronics Company Leads in Areas Such as Chips and Displays; Valuation Is Inexpensive
By Aaron Back

It is time to stop thinking of Samsung Electronics as a smartphone company.
Samsung¡¦s runaway success the past few years in smartphones had investors wondering if the South Korean giant could become the next Apple. That seems increasingly unlikely. But Samsung¡¦s leading position in less sexy chips, displays and other parts, plus its cheap valuation, still make it a company worth owning.
Samsung¡¦s mobile division, dominated by smartphones, brought in more than two-thirds of the company¡¦s operating profit last year, up from just around a quarter in 2010. Yet that era of smartphone dominance was short lived. The mobile division was likely the main culprit behind the company¡¦s forecast for a 60% decline in third-quarter operating profit. Shares are down nearly 20% this year.
There seems little prospect of a smartphone turnaround in the near future, given intense competition at the high end from Apple. At the low end is heat from Chinese handset makers who rely on the same Android operating system Samsung uses.
The outlook is less gloomy for Samsung¡¦s components businesses. In memory chips, it is the leader in both technology and in terms of scale in an industry once riven by competition, but now consolidated to just a handful of profitable players.
In logic chips, Samsung lost a major customer when Apple switched over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for its iPhones. But Samsung is ahead of TSMC in the next generation of smaller-transistor chips, and analysts predict it will win back some Apple orders next year. Similarly in displays, Samsung is at the technological forefront with organic light-emitting diode technology.
The stock looks cheap at eight times forward earnings and 1.1 times book value, below the 10-year averages of 10 times earnings and 1.7 times book. Back out $44.4 billion of net cash, and it trades at just six times forward earnings.
Even assuming Samsung¡¦s mobile business is worthless, which it isn¡¦t, the stock looks undervalued. Putting the chip business at two times book value¡Xa discount to rivals, who trade at an average of nearly three times¡Xand adding Samsung¡¦s cash and investments, leaves a higher valuation than the current market capitalization, notes Mark Newman of Bernstein Research.
In fact, Samsung has been cheap, at around eight times earnings or below, since the middle of 2012, even before the smartphone business peaked. What is missing is a catalyst to unlock value.
Investors have agitated for the company to return more of its massive cash reserves to boost the stock. Samsung had hinted for months that it would unveil a detailed plan to send more cash to shareholders with its first-half results, only to backtrack in July, saying it needed more time.
This foot-dragging is partially explained by the stock¡¦s true problem: the convoluted structure through which the Lee family controls the broader Samsung empire. Since family patriarch Lee Kun-hee was hospitalized with a heart attack earlier this year, his children appear to have started work on an opaque plan to rearrange assets.
One likely objective is to consolidate control over crown jewel Samsung Electronics, in which Lee family members hold only a small direct stake. This means they would benefit little from a distribution of cash to shareholders before the reshuffle. Similarly, Mr. Lee¡¦s heirs face a 50% inheritance tax on his stake in Electronics. There is little incentive for them to boost the share price beforehand.
Samsung¡¦s smartphone woes look set to continue. But bright prospects for its other business aren¡¦t reflected in the share price. For now, investors will have to wait for that value to be unlocked by the Lee family.

* Q3 revenue rises 6.4 pct
* Revenue boosted in part by iPhone 6 launch- Analysts
* Laird says expectations for full year unchanged
* Shares rise as much as 4.4 pct (Adds analyst comments, details, share movement)
Oct 22 (Reuters) - Laird Plc, a British electronic components maker, said third-quarter revenue rose 6.4 percent, driven by increased business from customers launching new products, selling more smartphones and investing in 4G LTE networks.
The company's shares rose as much as 4.5 percent to rank among the top percentage gainers on the FTSE 250 index on Wednesday morning.
Laird, whose customers include Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, said trading was in line and its expectations for the full year remained unchanged.
Revenue in the quarter rose to 150 million pounds from 141 million pounds a year earlier.
The revenue boost was mainly due to growth at its performance materials division, which makes products to ward off electromagnetic interference, manage heat dissipation and maintain signal quality in mobile phones and other electronics.
The division gained from Apple's iPhone 6 launch, share gains at Samsung and continued investment in LTE in China, Liberum analysts wrote in a note to clients.
Revenue from the business rose 8 percent to 101 million pounds, while Laird's wireless systems division, which makes antennas and remote control systems, saw a 3 percent rise in revenue.
Laird, which also makes smart chips for GPS and radio systems in cars, said the rise in wireless revenue was in part due to increased demand for its telematics products from the automotive market, particularly in North America.
The smaller signal-integrity business declined from a year earlier when the Xbox gaming console sales peaked, Liberum analysts said.

HitachiMaxell cuts profit forecast, reduces headcount in battery unit

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Hitachi Maxell Ltd cut its annual operating profit forecast by 40 percent to 5.1 billion yen ($48 million) on Wednesday and said it would reduce headcount in its lithium ion battery business after high-end smartphone sales sagged.               
The Japanese electronics maker, which supplies lithium ion batteries for Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's  smartphones, said it would offer voluntary retirement packages to 130 staff over 40-years old at the end of Feb 2015 and outsource an increased proportion of batteries after that.               
Samsung's July-September profit was the lowest in more than three years and the company said in early October that short-term prospects for its smartphones remained uncertain, as its sales are undercut by Chinese makers at the low end of the market and squeezed at the high end by Apple Inc.               
HitachiMaxell company left its net profit outlook at 6.75 billion yen and said it would pay a dividend of 31.5 yen for the first half after previously leaving the amount unclear. It also cut its full-year forecast by 7.8 percent to 154 billion yen.               
The company's shares closed 2.2 percent higher at 1,726 yen,  a level that was 16.6 percent lower than its offering price when it relisted in March. HitachiMaxell was spun off from Hitachi Ltd after becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2010.

* Q3 operating profit rises 21.8 pct y/y, beats estimates
* Tips Q4 profit to improve sequentially
SEOUL, Oct 22 (Reuters) - LG Display Co Ltd's July-September operating profit rose to its highest level in nearly two years, backed by healthy demand for television panels as well as the release of Apple Inc's new iPhone models.
The world's top liquid crystal display (LCD) maker had tipped both shipments and average selling price for LCDs to pick up sequentially during the third quarter, when analysts believed the company would benefit from a jump in orders as Apple readied the launch of its new larger-screen smartphones.
LG Display, which also counts sister company LG Electronics Inc as a major client, said LCD shipment volume for the third quarter rose from a year earlier though the average selling price for panels fell in annual terms.
For July-September, LG Display reported a 21.8 percent rise in operating profit to 474 billion won ($450.98 million). That compared with a 442 billion won mean estimate of 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S and marked the strongest level since the fourth quarter of 2012. Revenue fell 0.5 percent on year to 6.5 trillion won.
"In the third quarter, panel prices showed an upward trend as a tight supply situation continued due to increased demand for large-size panels," LG Display Chief Financial Officer Don Kim said in a statement.
LG Display said it expects fourth-quarter profit to improve sequentially, forecasting mid single-digit percentage rate panel shipment growth from July-September. Average selling price for panels is likely to remain stable in October-December from the previous quarter, it said.
Researcher WitsView said that August's large-sized panel shipments grew 5.6 percent from the previous month thanks in part to robust TV panel demand and tipped for further growth in September, indicating favourable conditions for panel makers.
Analysts also said that global shipments of ultra-high definition televisions, a premium product with significantly higher picture quality and fatter profit margins, also remain robust, lending support to panel makers such as LG Display.
Market dynamics are expected to remain favourable for LG Display. Analysts said that supply remains tight for TVs partly because of stronger demand for larger-sized panels, which is reducing production supply for certain mid-sized panels.
Orders for Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are expected to ramp up further in the fourth quarter following the launch of the devices in China, the world's largest smartphone market.
Researcher NPD DisplaySearch tips fourth-quarter panel shipments for the two iPhone models to rise to 75 million from 41 million in the July-September quarter.
Shares of LG Display closed 2.9 percent higher before the earnings release, compared with a 1.1 percent rise in the benchmark Kospi share index. (1 US dollar = 1,051.0500 Korean won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Christopher Cushing)

Corporate News: ICloud Hit by Attack in China --- Apple Warns of 'Organized' Efforts Aimed at Obtaining Users' Passwords, Data
673 words

Apple Inc.'s iCloud service for users in mainland China has been hit by an attack that could allow perpetrators to intercept and see usernames, passwords and other personal data, activists and security analysts said.
Though the perpetrator's identity was unclear, the attack came as tensions between the U.S. and Chinese governments have simmered over accusations of cyberespionage and hacking attacks. The online censorship watchdog GreatFire.org claimed Chinese authorities were behind the attack, though other experts said the source couldn't be determined.
A spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry said she was unaware of the matter and reiterated Beijing's position that it opposes cyberattacks.
Apple said in a statement on its website that it is aware of "intermittent organized network attacks" aimed at obtaining user information from iCloud.com. Apple said the attacks don't compromise the company's iCloud servers and don't affect iCloud sign-in on Apple devices running its iOS mobile software or Macs running OS X Yosemite using its Safari browser.
Apple said users should not sign into iCloud.com if they receive a warning from their browser that it is not a trusted site. This suggests that the user has been compromised.
Apple didn't mention China in its statement.
Concerns about the iCloud service in China began to emerge over the weekend when tech-savvy Chinese Internet users -- seeing warning messages on their Internet browsers -- raised suspicions in online discussion groups that the iCloud server's communications with users in China had been compromised.
Taiwan-based Chinese Internet activist Zhou Shuguang tested the service and found that communication channels between iCloud users and the iCloud server had been hijacked by an attacker in what is known as a "man-in-the-middle" tactic, Mr. Zhou said. Separately, Erik Hjelmvik, an analyst with Netresec AB, a network-security-software vendor in Sweden, said Tuesday he reviewed data posted online by Chinese Internet users and arrived at a similar conclusion.
"It's evident that it's quite massive," Mr. Hjelmvik said. He said the perpetrators were able to attack users in different parts of China who used different Internet service providers. "The attack was quite sophisticated in that they apparently have quite a huge system set up in order to be able to intercept on such a large scale."
The attack meant unauthorized parties would be able to decrypt the communication between iCloud users and the server, analysts said. This puts the iCloud users' usernames, passwords, files, pictures and contacts at risk of being seen unencrypted.
Activists like GreatFire.org accused the Chinese government of the attack. But some security analysts raised skepticism that Beijing, with sizable resources at its disposal, would order an attack that is so easily detected.
"This doesn't seem like the sort of attack an adversary with the resources of a government would attempt, since connecting users would see a very obvious security warning from their browser. It's more likely the sort of attack you'd see from someone with limited resources," said Kevin Milner, a researcher working on Internet infrastructure security at Oxford University.
The attack is the latest blow to Apple after a leak of celebrity photos from its iCloud system last month raised concerns about whether the service provides sufficient security.
Analysts pointed out that the reports of the attack surfaced around the time of the launch in China of Apple's latest iPhone, equipped with stronger encryption. In the wake of revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, Apple said it would use encryption on its phones that would prevent law enforcement from retrieving data on them.
Similar attacks have been reported in recent months affecting Chinese-based users accessing Google Inc. through a particular network, as well as Microsoft Corp.'s Hotmail services. Google and Microsoft didn't respond to requests for comment.

GT ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES
Agreement With Apple
allows Sale of Furnaces
GT Advanced Technologies has signed a pact with Apple Inc. for an "amicable parting of the ways," Luc Despins, attorney for the bankrupt supplier to the technology giant, said Tuesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Hampshire.
Apple was involved in a $578 million financing arrangement that set GT Advanced up in the business of making the synthetic sapphire-screen material. Instead of GT Advanced's sapphire, Apple sent the new generation of iPhones out with screens made from a Corning Inc. material.
Mr. Despins said the proposed settlement allows GT Advanced to try to sell the furnaces at the Mesa, Ariz. sapphire-manufacturing facility, and give the money to Apple, which financed the equipment. GT Advanced would surrender its claims against Apple, under the deal, and agree not to disparage the technology giant, he said.
Mr. Despins said GT Advanced and Apple have agreed to file a revised explanation for GT Advanced's surprise bankruptcy filing as part of the pact, and ultimately erase from the public record the court papers that set out what went wrong in the relationship between the two companies.
An Apple representative couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Apple has filed papers under seal in the case.

EMC
Cisco to Sell Portion
Of Stake in VCE Venture
EMC Corp. plans to buy a portion of Cisco Systems Inc.'s stake in a joint venture company called VCE that sells computing gear to corporate customers, people familiar with the matter said.
EMC will pay Cisco a "de minimus" amount for the portion of its stake, one person said. Spokesmen for EMC and Cisco declined to comment.
EMC posted an alert Tuesday stating it would hold a call with news media Wednesday morning to discuss a "new business development."
VCE, an acronym that stands for virtual computing environment, was established in 2009 with investors that also included VMware Inc. and Intel Corp.
Bloomberg reported news of the transaction between EMC and Cisco earlier Tuesday.

SAMSUNG
NSA Approves Some
Mobile Devices
Samsung Electronics Co. said the U.S. National Security Agency approved several of its mobile devices for use by government officials to carry classified information, a positive step for the smartphone maker's struggling mobile division.
The development comes as Samsung continues to work slowly but persistently to boost its appeal in the enterprise market by clearing the technological hurdles to ready Galaxy devices for corporate and government customers with high-security needs.
Samsung said on Tuesday that the NSA approved the Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note 3 smartphones and the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, among others, for use. On the same list of approved devices is Boeing Co.'s Boeing Black phone.

Harley-Davidson Inc. reported strong retail sales of its motorcycles and better-than-expected profit for the third quarter. World-wide retail sales at Harley dealers in the latest quarter grew 3.8% from a year earlier.
Despite the improved retail sales, Harley's profit fell 7.8% in the third quarter to $150.1 million, or 69 cents a share, down from $162.7 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue, including financial services, slipped 3.1% to $1.30 billion.

Careers: Bosses Seek Critical Thinking, but What Is It? --- Employers Stumble When Asked to Describe the Skills They Seek, Leaving Job Hunters Wondering What Employers Want
By Melissa Korn

Critical thinking is a critical skill for young workers these days.
What that means, though -- and how to measure it -- is less clear. Employers complain that colleges are not producing graduates who can solve problems and connect the dots on complex issues, but bosses stumble when pressed to describe exactly what skills make critical thinkers. That leaves job seekers wondering what employers really want and, once on the job, unsure of whether they're supposed to follow the rules or break them.
Mentions of critical thinking in job postings have doubled since 2009, according to an analysis by career-search site Indeed.com. The site, which combs job ads from several sources, found last week that more than 21,000 health-care and 6,700 management postings contained some reference to the skill.
"It's one of those words -- like diversity was, like big data is -- where everyone talks about it but there are 50 different ways to define it," says Dan Black, Americas director of recruiting at the accounting firm and consultancy EY.
Brittany Holloway, a music-business major who graduated last spring from New York University, says critical thinking appeared in so many postings during her job search that it, along with traits like "detail-oriented" and "organized," was nearly meaningless. Only in interviews could she tell what a company meant when it sought those traits.
Ms. Holloway, who now works as a content-review and fraud specialist at Brooklyn-based digital-music distributor TuneCore, defines the skill as "forming your own opinion from a variety of different sources."
Ms. Holloway, 21 years old, says her current job requires her to think critically when screening music releases before they're sent to digital stores like Apple Inc.'s iTunes.
Behavioral interview prompts, such as "Talk about how you handled working with a difficult person," help EY bosses assess critical-thinking skills, says Mr. Black. (His definition: "The ability to work with data, to accumulate it, analyze it [and] synthesize it, in order to make balanced assessments and smart decisions.")
In late-round interviews, candidates must show how they would tackle business problems, such as whether it makes more sense for a company to make or buy a product, and why.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asks investment-banking and sales-and-trading candidates to assess company valuations and stock pitches and then to explain how they arrived at their conclusions.
By the end of one of those exercises, "the candidates should have displayed whether they possess critical thinking," says Michael Desmarais, global head of recruiting for the bank.
Critical thinking may be similar to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's famous threshold for obscenity: You know it when you see it, says Jerry Houser, associate dean and director of career services at Willamette University in Salem, Ore.
When recruiters tell Mr. Houser they want students with problem-solving skills, "that usually has something to do with critical thinking," he says. His office encourages students to prepare stories to illustrate their critical-thinking prowess, detailing, for example, the steps a club president took to improve attendance at weekly meetings.
Colleges' capacity to mold thinkers has been a topic of heated debate. Richard Arum, co-author of "Academically Adrift" and "Aspiring Adults Adrift" as well as an NYU sociology professor, is a prominent critic of how schools are faring on that front.
"Schools have institutionally supported and encouraged [a] retreat from academic standards and rigor," he says, adding that he thinks colleges have allowed students to focus on their social lives at the expense of academic pursuits.
According to research detailed in those books, students rarely study on their own for more than an hour a day, and most don't write in-depth papers that require sustained analysis.
For their part, students seem to think they are ready for the office. But their future bosses tend to disagree. A Harris Interactive survey of 2,001 U.S. college students and 1,000 hiring managers last fall found that 69% of students felt they were "very or completely prepared" for problem-solving tasks in the workplace, while fewer than half of the employers agreed.
Judy Nagengast, CEO of Continental Inc., an Anderson, Ind., staffing firm, says she has come across young graduates who "can memorize and they can regurgitate" but who struggle to turn book learning into problem solving at work.
Ms. Nagengast says she grew frustrated with young accountants who didn't understand the importance of accuracy on tax forms and filed "B-minus financial statements." She wants and needs to recruit young workers, though, and she is testing the waters with a fresh graduate who's handling the firm's compliance with the Affordable Care Act.
Linda Elder, an educational psychologist and the president of the Foundation for Critical Thinking, which promotes educational reform, says employers really want well-trained problem solvers and not critical thinkers, especially in the lower ranks. Critical thinkers, she says, tend to challenge the status quo, which isn't always what a boss is after.
At Goldman, "we don't expect new hires to propose changes to our chairman or board on a firm-wide strategy level on Day One," says Mr. Desmarais. But the bank's entry-level hires are expected to do more than just fulfill orders, he adds. "We do encourage our junior people to recommend changes."

Technisys Raises Banking Funding

A startup that powers Latin American banks delivering services to people via mobile, ATMs, and online has secured $13 million in Series B funding from investors including Intel Capital.
Miami-based Technisys SA, founded in 1996, employs 300. It has grown as the region's middle class has exploded, with clients including Citibank, Banco Itau, Banco Estado de Chile and Banco Original seeking to reach customers through multiple channels for services including savings, payments and loans. The company is tracking to do $30 million in revenue this year.
"The banks should be reaching the customer in a holistic way. That means allowing them to connect via the Web, tablet, ATMs, smartphones and new wearable devices," Technisys Chief Executive Miguel Santos said.
Technisys, like legacy players SAP and Oracle Corp., unifies the information siloed within those applications and gives banks a more streamlined way to securely interact with customers.
The role of banks in Latin America, where some 60% of adults don't have accounts, according to a 2012 study by the World Bank, is at an interesting juncture. Along with facing competition from major retailers like Wal-Mart offering in-store banking services, startups such as Boku Inc. and Mopay AG and services Google Wallet and Apple Pay make it easy for consumers to pay for goods and services with their mobile phones.
Intel Capital Vice President and General Manager for Latin America Steve Long said he met Mr. Santos more than a year ago. He said there was a large opportunity in financial services, and he believes Technisys is well positioned to succeed.
"Banks need solutions that enhance [the] banking experience across channels, increasing revenue opportunities and customer loyalty," Mr. Long said. "Digital channel convergence, which represents the main focus for Technisys, is one of the most relevant trends in digital banking today."
Alta Venture, KaSZeK Ventures, Endeavor Catalyst and existing investor Holdinvest also contributed. The company previously raised $1 million from Holdinvest.
Mr. Santos expanded the financing round's $8 million initial target to $13 million to get additional investors.

* Won up on exporters, offshore funds
    * Rupiah eases on importers, traders book profits
 (Adds text, updates prices)
    By Jongwoo Cheon
    SINGAPORE, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Most emerging Asian currencies
edged up on Wednesday as regional stocks advanced and sentiment
improved, with the European Central Bank seen readying to launch
its plan to buy corporate bonds.
    South Korea's won gained on demand from exporters
for month-end settlements and as some offshore funds bought the
currency.
    Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose
nearly 1 percent, tracking higher U.S. stocks after
stronger-than-expected earnings from Apple Inc and
Texas Instruments Inc.
    Risk appetite improved as the ECB is considering buying
corporate bonds on the secondary market and may decide on the
matter as soon as December, several sources told Reuters.
 
    Emerging Asian currencies, however, failed to fully benefit
from strong equity performances and the ECB's stimulus plan as
the dollar broadly rose against a basket of major
currencies.
    "Any rebound in Asian currencies is unlikely to last long,"
said Jeong My-young, Samsung Futures' research head in Seoul.
    "Given differentials in economic fundamentals and interest
rates, the dollar's strong trend will sustain."
    
    RUPIAH
    The rupiah eased on dollar demand from importers for
month-end payments.
    Traders booked profits from gains in the currency, which on
Tuesday hit its strongest in about four weeks.
    The official Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR),
which the central bank launched last year in an effort to manage
exchange rate fluctuations, was fixed at 12,026 rupiah per
dollar, weaker than Tuesday's 11,993.

No Whiplash as China Slows
Don't look for China to derail the global economy just yet.
Official figures show China grew 7.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest rate since the financial crisis, but far from a hard landing.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, it expanded an annualized 7.8%, a slowdown from the previous quarter's 8.2% rate, but still faster than earlier this year. Those looking for a collapse of the Chinese economy will continue to wait.
The all-important property market remains troubled, but has avoided a free fall. Sales declined 10% in September from the year earlier. That isn't as bad as the previous two months, possibly a mild reaction to a number of stimulus measures the government has unveiled such as cheaper mortgages and removal of restrictions on speculators.
Yet any real-estate recovery will likely be tepid, as unsold inventories continue to expand, up 28% from a year earlier, and prices continue to fall.
Other figures show the economy holding up despite property-market problems. Though still among the weakest readings of the past five years, industrial-production growth recovered to 8% in September from 6.9% in August. Retail sales, adjusted for inflation, expanded 10.8% in September, compared with 10.6% in August.
For deflation worriers in the U.S., China's slowdown adds to the hand-wringing, as its exports to the U.S. will stay cheap. Yet there also are benefits from China's industrial-led slowdown. Prime among them is the self-correcting stimulus to the world provided by weak oil prices. That is one kind of deflation that has typically been a benefit to the U.S. economy.
Another silver lining for the U.S. is that China's demand for services -- outside those related to real estate -- remains healthy. Services now account for over one-quarter of what the U.S. sells to China, up from 15% in 2006. While coal miners don't much like China's industrial slowdown, Hollywood, lawyers, consultants and travel-related businesses should continue to find a robust market there.
Beijing has guided the economy with dribs and drabs of stimulus in the past few months, providing just enough support to ensure a gentle descent. It has resisted broad-based interest-rate cuts, wanting to avoid a return to the old debt-fueled growth playbook. With the government's view on labor markets still optimistic, it will take more evidence of the property market infecting the financial system and overall economy for Beijing's approach to change.
Given the fragile situation in Europe and other emerging markets, it is natural for investors to also fret about China. But for now, a stable slowdown hardly makes China the worst of the world's worries.
-- Alex Frangos
The ECB's Shopping List
Doesn't Stop Expanding
It still is all about the central banks.
That much is clear from the reaction to a report Tuesday that the European Central Bank could decide as soon as December to buy corporate bonds. In short order, the euro fell half a cent against the dollar, stocks and Southern European government-bond prices jumped and the cost to insure investment-grade corporate debt fell. The ECB said no decisions had been taken.
The ECB has been careful not to rule out further stimulus measures beyond those already announced. But the market believes the ECB will have trouble lifting its balance sheet back to the size it was in 2012 -- implying an expansion of 650 billion euros to 1 trillion euros ($832 billion to $1.28 trillion) -- by targeting these instruments. Buying eurozone government bonds is clearly a last-resort option, such a move being politically controversial and practically difficult.
Buying corporate bonds could give the ECB a big market to target; there are 710 billion euros of securities in the Markit iBoxx nonfinancial senior corporate bond index, and issuance is plentiful. And such a move, while radical, isn't beyond the pale. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan both have bought corporate debt.
But there clearly are risks. First, the ECB already has its hands full. It only started buying covered bonds on Monday and will be handing out fresh loans to banks in December. To throw corporate bonds into the mix so quickly might show a lack of faith in the existing options, a bad signal to send.
Second, there is the question of what the ECB would hope to achieve with such purchases, beyond a short-term boost to market sentiment. The iBoxx nonfinancial index currently yields just 1.44%, down from 2.41% at the end of 2013.
And investment-grade companies have no trouble at all raising money. The bigger issue is whether they are willing to spend it. The ECB could make a difference by buying high-yield bonds, which could boost access to markets for smaller companies. But that is likely a step too far; the ECB already has been stung by criticism that asset-backed-bond purchases will load its balance sheet with junk.
Third, even with a large market, it isn't clear the ECB could expand its balance sheet quickly. Investors may not be willing to sell, as they would face a reinvestment headache. Indeed, that is one reason for the resilience of Europe's corporate-bond market in the current turmoil.
J.P. Morgan Chase economists suggest purchases could reach 50 billion euros over one year, extending to 100 billion euros if market turnover rises. Given a 2 trillion-plus euro balance sheet, that is relatively small.
Despite this, such actions, even if small, ultimately could crowd investors into riskier assets such as stocks. The aim would be to lift prices elsewhere, sparking some confidence that leads to renewed investing and lending. But that may be less effective in Europe than in the U.S., as the continent relies on the banking system to provide financing more than capital markets.
Still, the ECB is facing a clamor for market action that is only getting louder and economic data that is getting worse. Absent unified thinking and action on Europe's fiscal front, the central bank may have little choice but to stay at the center of the action.

Apple's Big Screen Shot
Apple's newest iPhones may not bend easily, but they have tweaked the company's business enough to merit attention -- in a good way.
The company Monday delivered strong results for its fiscal fourth quarter, fueled mainly by better-than-expected sales of the iPhone. Apple launched two new models in the final weeks of the quarter ending in September, enough to boost unit sales by 16%, year over year.
Notably, the average selling price for the smartphone rose to an estimated $603, up more than 4% year over year.
This shouldn't be ignored. Apple is famous for keeping its product offerings simple. Yet its transformation into one to the world's largest tech companies has demanded a more complex approach.
Launching one new smartphone a year wasn't cutting it, as customers were demanding more variety in screen sizes and design. Adding the megasize iPhone 6 Plus this year gave Apple a needed offering in the so-called phablet category that has proved a draw for many consumers.
Another gambit appears to have paid off as well: Apple dropped 32-gigabyte iPhones from its newest offerings, offering 64-gigabyte versions at the same price. Some worried that this -- along with the larger screens -- would depress profitability. But the company's overall gross margin came in at 38% for the quarter, a percentage point higher than last year's launch period of the iPhone 5s and 5c models.
The strong results bode well for Apple going into the December period, which will include more markets for the iPhone -- including China. Wall Street is projecting iPhone unit sales to rise 20% year over year for that period. That looks achievable.
The potential for the Apple Watch that goes on sale next year remains a question mark, as does its newly launched payments service, Apple Pay.
Even so, the stock remains valued at about 14 times earnings -- a bargain given Apple's ability to upsell its flagship product.

(The Day Ahead is an email and PDF publication that includes the day's major stories and events, analyses and other features. To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) A fretful global economy and suddenly volatile markets will form the backdrop for the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. There is no press conference and no new individual economic forecasts due from policymakers. But the statement at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) Wednesday will be parsed for any sign that the Fed is worried that trouble in Europe or elsewhere may infect the U.S. recovery and slowg its timetable for an initial rate increase.
Pfizer Inc is expected to post lower third-quarter earnings, hurt by cheaper generics, but investors will be especially interested in clues on whether the largest U.S. drugmaker will renew its unsolicited bid for British rival AstraZeneca Plc. Pfizer walked away after its final $118 billion bid was rejected on May 26, but under UK law will be allowed to resume its quest for its smaller rival in late November.
DuPont, the largest U.S. chemical maker by market capitalization, is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit, helped by higher earnings from its safety and protection, nutrition and health and industrial biosciences businesses. However, the company's farm business is expected to take a hit from farmers' preference for soybean seeds rather than corn seeds, which is the mainstay of the unit. The focus this quarter will be also be on the company's response to demands from activist investor Nelson Peltz, who has called on the company to break itself up, blaming its conglomerate structure for "underperformance." U.S. durable goods orders probably rose in September, and a reading on business investment spending is also expected to show an increase. A good set of data would suggest the manufacturing recovery remains on solid ground after a see-saw ride in news orders that reflected lumpy aircraft demand (0830/1230). CaseShiller's home price index for August (0900/1300) and the Conference Board's consumer confidence figures for October will also be released (1000/1400). Consumer confidence is expected to edge higher after hitting its lowest level since May in September. Facebook Inc, owner of the world's No.1 Internet social network, releases third-quarter results after the bell. Mark Zuckerberg has wowed Wall Street by turning Facebook into the industry's most effective mobile advertising platform. But while investors should cheer what's expected to be another quarter of strong revenue growth, they will also be eager for details about the timeline for making money from the collection of pricy assets that the company has acquired, including Instagram, WhatsApp and virtual reality headset maker Oculus. Swiss bank UBS AG's third-quarter report comes as it faces down several potentially costly probes. Last month, UBS warned of new fines after confirming it was holding talks to settle allegations that it was involved in rigging foreign exchange rates. UBS also faces a French investigation into whether it helped wealthy French individuals dodge tax, in connection to which French investigating magistrates have proposed the bank pay a fine of 4.88 billion euros ($6.2 billion), according to a judicial source. UBS is currently asking investors to swap their shares into a new group holding company, a restructuring effort designed to ensure it can be broken up more easily in a crisis. Analysts expect French drugmaker Sanofi SA's third quarter to look good compared with year earlier, helped by a recovery in its animal health and vaccines units and by more favorable exchange rates. Investors will be on the lookout for comments on M&A, new allegations of bribery within Sanofi subsidiaries in East Africa and the Middle East, and the group's plans to offload a portfolio of off-patent drugs and the plants that make them in France. Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG is expected to report a slight rise in third-quarter sales, despite facing full generic competition to its once best-selling blood pressure pill Diovan for the first time.
Biotech Gilead Sciences Inc, maker of $84,000 hepatitis C drug Solvaldi, reports third-quarter results and will likely provide an update on the launch of Harvoni, an even more expensive combination treatment for the virus that was approved by regulators earlier this month. Early U.S. prescription statistics show that Harvoni is off to a strong start and investors will be looking for confirmation of continued robust sales despite the backlash from some insurers. Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company, is expected to provide an update on its pipleline of drugs in development and further details on the reorganization plans it announced in July at a formal presentation for analysts and investors at a New York hotel. Amgen may also address recent calls by a major shareholder to split into two companies - one for older legacy products and another for new growth medicines. Electronic Arts Inc offers the first snapshot of the videogaming industry when it reports third-quarter results after the bell as it gears up for the holiday season. The company that gave us the "Sims" and a hodge-podge of bestselling U.S. sporting simulations hopes to boost its software sales and devise a mobile-gaming strategy that can win Wall Street's approval. Arizona-based Freeport-McMoran Inc is expected to report lower earnings in the third quarter on the back of weaker copper and gold prices and volumes, the latter due to an export ban in Indonesia. The market's focus will likely be on the company's potential to build a smelter in Indonesia as well as the renegotiation of its contract of work in the country. There will likely also be questions on safety at the country's massive Grasberg mine after four workers died last month. Investors will also be hoping for an update on plans for sales of non-core assets as they company works to reduce its $20 billion debt. Anadarko Petroleum Corp reports third-quarter earnings, but Wall Street is most interested in the company's spending plans for next year following a more than 20 percent slide in crude prices. Health insurer Aetna Inc is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit and detail how its sizeable new business on the Obamacare exchanges is shaping up after its first full quarter of paying claims for these new customers. Hard-drive maker Western Digital Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit above analysts' estimates, according to StarMine, helped by higher demand for storage used in servers and data centers. Investors will look out for updates on the company's full-year outlook. Quarterly results from Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc, operator of the Sheraton and Westin hotel chains, and Marriott International Inc, owner of Ritz-Carlton brand, are expected to benefit from a strong increase in global travel. The market will be looking for an update on 2015 forecasts, when hotel occupancy in the U.S. is expected to be at the highest since 1995, according to a lodging forecast from PwC. For both companies, there will likely questions about how Ebola could affect travel. Timken Co is expected to report lower-than-expected third-quarter profit, hurt by weakness in the mining and agricultural industries, according to StarMine. Timken supplies ball bearings to companies such as Caterpillar and Cummins. Both the companies have cited softness in the mining industry for its weak results. Timken recently laid out plans to restructure its aerospace unit, which will result in pre-tax charges of $110 to $120 million in this quarter. Investors will be looking for comments on its reported bid for Emerson Electric's power transmission solutions business. Coal and natgas producer Consol Energy Inc is expected to post a third-quarter profit compared a year-earlier loss due to heavy tax expenses. However, revenue is expected to plunge about 28 percent amid weak natural gas and oil prices, and softening demand for thermal coal from the power sector. Investors will want to know about the future of demand, and the company's capital budget. Miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a bigger loss in the third quarter as weak prices for steel-making coal continues to offset cost cuts. Rail line congestion in Western U.S. states and a slowdown in the Chinese steel market is also expected to hurt the company's bottom line. Coach Inc, known for its Poppy handbags, will report first-quarter results amid high expectations as the company begins to see strong demand for its products from international markets. Investors will look for details on the company's performance in China, where it has seen strong growth in the past, and will also keep an eye out for any updates on the previously announced closure of about 70 stores in North America. Investors in speciality glass maker Corning Inc will focus on any benefit from strong sales of Apple Inc's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which use Corning's Gorilla glass and will also look for guidance on opportunities from the auto industry, which analysts say is larger than the LCD market and one that Corning is planning to enter. Discount brokerage firm TD Ameritrade Holding Corp reports its fiscal year-end results and outlook for 2015. Recent market volatility is a positive for the firm since it is popular with do-it-yourself traders who try to take advantages of ups and downs in the stock market. But the protracted delay by the Federal Reserve is a negative since AMTD and other discount brokers make much of their money on returns from investing their clients' cash. Insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc's third-quarter results are expected to beat estimates, according to StarMine. Marsh, which kicks off brokers' earnings season, is expected to benefit from the rising insurance rates in the United States. Satellite radio service provider Sirius XM Holdings Inc is expected to report third-quarter revenue above analysts' average estimate, according to StarMine. Analysts speculate the company is likely to benefit from a strong market for auto sales. Buyers of new cars fitted with Sirius receivers typically get free access for a few months but then must pay to keep the service. The company raised its full-year revenue forecast last quarter. Wall Street will be looking for an update from Panera Bread Co on its effort to speed up service at its popular bakery-cafes when it reports third-quarter results. Up until it started reporting problems with service times, Panera was mentioned in the same breath as Chipotle, which is renowned for its ability to squeeze ever more sales out of existing restaurants. Home appliance maker Whirlpool Corp and Cummins Inc, which makes diesel engines, gas turbines and assorted automotive parts, also report third-quarter results.

EXCLUSIVE-Amazon buys comedy service Rooftop Media to expand digital content

(Adds executives' comments, details on Rooftop and Audible)
By Liana B. Baker
NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is buying online comedy service Rooftop Media, a small deal that underscores the Internet retailer's broader ambition of becoming a media and entertainment powerhouse.
Amazon is persisting in buying content to round out its service, with designs to take on Netflix Inc and other online digital media services. But that increasing spending has helped keep the company in the red, inviting criticism from investors.
Audible, the audiobooks service it bought in 2008 for $300 million, is picking up the 10-person company for an undisclosed sum. Audible founder and Chief Executive Donald Katz said in a statement on Monday the company had been attracted by Rooftop's content as well as its pool of comic talent.
Rooftop records comedians at clubs across the country and licenses the digital rights to thousands of hours of comedy, which is broadcast either live or later on demand. The company's media partners include Apple Inc and Yahoo, and it also works with streaming services such as Sirius XM , Spotify and Pandora.
Its content now becomes part of Audible, itself a fast-growing seller of online audiobooks, and vastly increases Rooftop's audience, said Rooftop Chief Executive Officer Will Rogers.
Amazon is expected to continue acquiring digital content at a rapid clip. In past years, it began investing heavily to branch out from its online retail roots, delving into Hollywood-style content production as well as developing a line of tablets, smartphones and set-top boxes to accelerate the sale of digital content.
Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos' vision of becoming a tech and media powerhouse, however, has drawn protests from an investor community that for years overlooked its lack of profits because of red-hot revenue growth.
That growth may be in danger of stalling. Last week, the company missed revenue and income expectations and projected a disappointing 7 to 18 percent rise in holiday-quarter sales.
Amazon's stock was up 0.6 percent on Monday but is down about a third from January. (Reporting by Liana Baker; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Cynthia Osterman)

CHICAGO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp will ban Apple Inc's new electronic payments service in its 4,572 stores as it commits to joining a consortium of other large retailers developing a rival payments system.
Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp , Kohl's Corp have all refused to accept Apple Pay at their stores.
Apple Pay, which was unveiled in September, is a mobile payment app that allows consumers to buy things by simply holding their iPhone6 and 6 Plus devices up to readers installed by store merchants.
The rival system, called Current C, is being developed by Merchants Customer Exchange (MCX), a consortium of merchants that includes Rite Aid and CVS.
Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said the company is continually evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies.
On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Rite Aid and CVS Health Corp had refused to accept Apple Pay.(http://nyti.ms/1rJ2RsA) CVS did not immediately respond to queries seeking comment.
"I think these two retailers - Rite Aid and CVS - have committed contractually to MCX," said Nick Holland, senior analyst, payments, Javelin Strategy & Research.
"I believe there was an exclusivity agreement ...which means that as part of the MCX consortium that was your point-of-sale mobile payment network." (Reporting by Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne in Chicago; Editing by David Gregorio)

* Axel Springer and New York Times invest 3 mln euros
* Readers charged average of 20 euro cents per story
* Blendle working on smartphone and tablet app
By Harro Ten Wolde
FRANKFURT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Publishers Axel Springer and The New York Times have together invested 3 million euros ($3.8 million) in Dutch start-up Blendle, betting it has answers to the problem of how to charge readers who eschew costly online subscriptions.
Publishers have been experimenting with how to charge for content since the early days of the Internet, but many have failed to crack the code.
With Blendle, readers can browse online newspaper and magazines and pay an average of 20 euro cents per story without being locked in to a subscription. Blendle keeps 30 percent of the fee, the publisher receives the rest.
The business also offers the attention-grabbing feature of potential refunds if a user does not like a story after reading it, though these have an upper limit depending on how many stories a reader has paid for.
The service is available only in the Netherlands as a web app, though Blendle is working on a smartphone and tablet app for Apple devices.
"The main reason we decided to go along with The New York Times and Axel Springer is that we think along the same lines about digital journalism," Blendle co-founder Alexander Kloepping said.
"We hope to use the knowledge and experience Springer and the New York Times can offer to build out the company. It may well be that our company looks completely different in a year."
Many newspaper and magazine publishers have been under pressure to replace an evaporating pool of print advertising income - once the lifeblood of newspapers - with digital advertisements and money from subscriptions.
Axel Springer now generates more than half of its revenue from digital activities, while circulation revenue at the New York Times has been been boosted by digital subscriptions that now account for more than 50 percent of total revenue.
'FREEMIUM' MODEL
German publisher Axel Springer has attracted more than 300,000 subscribers for its so-called "freemium" model for its best-selling daily newspaper Bild since launching the service more than a year ago.
Europe's largest daily offers some online content free but some items such as exclusive interviews, stories and photos are subject to a charge.
The New York Times had about 831,000 digital-only subscribers at the end of the second quarter, almost a fifth more than a year earlier, despite conceding that new digital products have failed to live up to expectations.
Blendle describes itself as "the iTunes of journalism", referring to Apple's music-selling service, and receives about half of its traffic via mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The other half is from desktop computers and about a fifth of revenue comes from social media referrals by other readers, Kloepping said.
"It is always good to try different models, but it will be difficult," said Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum. "Especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries. There will always be a lot of free news and articles available."
In the six months since it went live, Blendle has attracted more than 130,000 users in the Netherlands, 60 percent of whom are aged between 20 and 35.
That group is important for publishers because they increasingly consume information via tablets and smartphones instead of printed newspapers and magazines.
"We as a publisher want to convince people that in the digital age good journalism is worth the money," Axel Springer Chief Executive Mathias Doepfner said in a statement.
"Blendle has the potential to appeal to young, internet-savvy readers." (1 US dollar = 0.7873 euro) (Editing by David Goodman)

Corporate News: Fewer Tied to AT&T Plans
By Thomas Gryta   
878 words
25 October 2014
The Wall Street Journal
J

English
(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   
A surprising fact emerged from AT&T Inc.'s financial results this week: up to 10 million of the company's most lucrative wireless customers may be free to walk out the door.
The situation is a result of AT&T's transition from plans that offer subsidized phones under two-year contracts to plans where customers buy their own phones on 20- to 24-month installment plans without other obligations to stick with AT&T.
The contracts and installment plans both have the effect of binding customers to the carrier. But while AT&T is experiencing its lowest-ever rate of cancellations, the company indicated this week that millions of subscribers may have fallen through the cracks.
On Wednesday, AT&T surprised analysts when it said 20 million of its 75 million postpaid subscribers were getting discounted pricing and were eligible to upgrade to new phones on installment plans but hadn't signed up by Sept. 30. On Thursday, an AT&T spokesman said most of those 20 million subscribers were still on traditional contracts -- but not all, leaving potentially millions who are paying for service but have no obligation to stay with the carrier.
AT&T is confident those customers will stay put, however. Many are on plans with family members who may be under contract, and all are enjoying lower bills after AT&T cut their rates earlier this year, with a typical subscriber saving around $15 a month.
Still, their freedom to leave is a sign of the new competitive risks to wireless carriers as the industry moves rapidly away from the contract model.
"The real question is what will happen in Q4 when a large number of customers buy iPhones," said Craig Moffett, an analyst at researcher MoffettNathanson LLC. A large portion of AT&T smartphone customers use the iPhone, which was once exclusively sold by the carrier, and the recent update to the phone is expected to drive upgrades.
"At least some will look for better deals elsewhere. Churn will rise," Mr. Moffett said.
Carriers have moved away from contracts in part because customers don't like them and because the shift rids them of the burden of subsidizing expensive devices like Apple Inc.'s iPhone.
The rub for providers is that customers who pay for their own devices have an incentive to hang on to them as long as possible to hold down their expenses. This can leave them untethered to the carrier and vulnerable to competitors stealing them away.
An AT&T subscriber using two gigabytes of data a month on the carrier's no-contract Next plan and a fully paid-off phone would spend $65 a month for wireless service. Buying a new base model iPhone 6 would add at least $27 a month to the tally.
In February, AT&T quietly started cutting prices for customers on plans that require contracts. It has also made those people eligible to switch to a Next plan and upgrade to a new phone under its installment scheme after just six months under their existing contracts. Some people are still switching.
Millions of those eligible customers haven't taken the bait, and their numbers are swelling. On its earnings conference call Wednesday, AT&T said the number of subscribers who could upgrade but hadn't yet -- subscribers it calls "pre-Next" -- had grown from 17 million at the end of June.
Many of those customers are free to jump ship whenever they want. Some are in contracts that every month come closer to ending, while the rest have no financial obligation at all to stay with AT&T.
For carriers, having a large part of the customer base floating without obligations may be the new reality.
T-Mobile US Inc., which pioneered the no-contract model, has about 80% of its postpaid customers on such plans, and as many as a quarter of them aren't financing a device, meaning they aren't tethered to its service. Verizon Communications Inc. and Sprint Corp. don't disclose the portion of their customers not on contracts.
Installment plans have a similar effect to contracts as subscribers need to pay off the full cost of phones -- which can run to $650 or more -- if they leave the carrier.
Wall Street analysts raised concerns this week that the new disclosures signal AT&T may have to work harder to hold on to customers who may be staying around only because of discounts and are at risk of leaving when they do decide to upgrade their phones.
"The vast majority are on family plans," Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said in an interview. "They are locked in."
Mr. Stephens cited low monthly service cancellations, or churn, as proof that customers won't leave. AT&T's churn so far this year is on pace to be the company's lowest ever, including just 0.86% in the second quarter and 0.99% in the third quarter.
"The facts support that we are doing OK with keeping customers happy," Mr. Stephens said.

A Sad Song for iTunes Sales --- Apple Readies Relaunch of Beats Music as Downloads Drop 14% at Online Store

The growing availability of cheap music -- from free videos and streams to $10-a-month unlimited subscription plans -- is sapping demand for digital downloads at the world's biggest seller of music, Apple Inc.
Music sales at Apple's iTunes Store have fallen 13% to 14% world-wide since the start of the year, according to people familiar with the matter. The decline is stark compared with a much shallower dip last year. Global revenue from downloads fell 2.1% in 2013, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
The plummeting download numbers help illustrate why Apple bought the $10-a-month subscription streaming service Beats Music earlier this year, as part of its $3 billion acquisition that included headphone maker Beats Electronics. Apple is rebuilding Beats Music and plans to relaunch it next year as part of iTunes, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Some record company executives worry their industry could lurch back into decline after several years of relative stability, should download sales decline faster than streaming growth accelerates. A key part of that equation, executives say, is persuading enough users of online music services to pay a monthly subscription fee, usually $10 a month, rather than stick with free versions that carry advertising and generate much less revenue for record labels. Spotify AB offers such a free, ad-supported option; Beats Music doesn't.
Factoring in CD sales, which have been plunging for well over a decade, overall music sales in most of the world held steady last year. Japan was an exception, with steep drops in physical and digital sales alike. World-wide revenue from recorded music totaled $15 billion in 2013. In the U.S., recorded music sales are nearly 50% below their peak in 2000, though they've been essentially flat for the past few years.
This year's decline in global iTunes music sales mirrors domestic declines. U.S. revenue from downloads of singles and albums fell 11% and 14%, respectively, in the first half of 2014, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. But a 28% jump in revenue from streaming music services helped overall digital revenue increase slightly to $2.2 billion in the first six months of the year.
Nielsen Entertainment analyst Dave Bakula chalked up the declines in downloads mostly to "a shift in the way consumers are consuming music," noting that total streams on services such as Spotify and Pandora Media Inc. were up 46% for the year to date, compared with last year. Streaming services now account for nearly one-third of the revenue from recorded music in the U.S., according to the RIAA.
On Thursday, Pandora, which offers both a paid streaming service and free, ad-supported music, said it ended the third quarter with 76.5 million active listeners, up 5.2% from a year earlier. Pandora's shares, however, tumbled Friday as it warned of "an increasingly competitive environment" and slowing user growth.
This week, Spotify dropped prices for its streaming service, allowing family members to share one account at discounted rates. The company, whose premium service typically costs $10 a month, has about 40 million subscribers, of whom around a quarter are paying users.
The relative trajectories of downloads and streaming vary widely from market to market. In Japan, the second biggest music market, there is little streaming business to speak of. In a handful of smaller markets including Sweden, streaming is almost all there is; paid downloads are virtually unheard of.
Despite the slowing U.S. music sales, Apple reported this week that global iTunes sales -- including movies, apps and books -- increased to $4.6 billion in the third quarter, up from $4.3 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Apple didn't break out figures for music sales.
Another factor potentially weighing down digital sales could be this year's album release schedule, which features bigger end-of-the-year releases than last year's, said Nielsen's Mr. Bakula. Taylor Swift's forthcoming pop album, "1989," is slated for release next week and is expected to be one of the year's biggest sellers. British boy band One Direction and hip-hop star Eminem have albums due out next month.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- The New Basics: Stocks: How to Play Defense
By John F. Wasik   
1,012 words
25 October 2014
The Wall Street Journal
J

The stock market has been taking investors on a white-knuckle ride in recent weeks. Some of the ways investors try to manage volatility can be nerve-racking, too.
The S&P 500 has fallen more than 1% six times and risen more than 1% five times since the index hit an all-time high on Sept. 18. By contrast, there weren't any such single-day swings between Aug. 9 and Sept. 24.
Jittery investors are worried about the U.S. economic recovery, higher interest rates and slow growth in Europe, among other issues. Strong gains in recent years have boosted share prices and stoked concerns that stocks are priced too high.
The market upheaval has put a spotlight on strategies investors can use to try to protect themselves from steep losses in a downturn. For example, a handful of funds allow investors to profit from volatile moves and log gains when stocks fall.
But the share prices of such funds can just as quickly leap or fall. "You don't just plunk them in a portfolio for the long term," says Eric Dutram, an analyst who tracks exchange-traded funds at Zacks Investments, a research firm based in Chicago.
For investors who just want to smooth out a bumpy ride, the better bet may be a balanced fund that holds a mix of stocks and bonds. Here's what you need to know about each approach.
-- The wagers of fear. Financial whizzes look for signs of volatility in stock prices by watching the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index, or VIX, informally known as the fear gauge.
The VIX tracks near-term volatility as measured by S&P 500 index options prices. A high VIX means stock prices are more likely to fluctuate -- and often decline. As recently as July, the VIX was at its lowest level since 2007, before the financial crisis.
But the index has spiked recently, which has benefited investors in funds that track the VIX. The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Exchange-Traded Note, which has $968 million invested, gained 15% over the past month, through Thursday, according to Chicago-based investment researcher Morningstar. Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments backed by the issuer that promise to pay a return based on the performance of a market measure.
A similar fund, the ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, which has $90 million invested, is up 14% over the same period.
The iPath note charges annual fees of 0.89%, or $89 on a $10,000 investment, while the ProShares fund charges 0.83%.
But such products also can lose big in periods of calm, such as when stocks are gaining steadily or basically flat, which makes them unsuitable for most buy-and-hold investors. The iPath note, for example, fell nearly 78% in 2012 and 67% last year. Even with its recent gains, the note is down 21% year to date, according to Morningstar.
The risks are real even for investors who watch their portfolios carefully, because it is difficult if not impossible to consistently predict when stocks will be calm or volatile.
-- Down is the new up. Some funds aim to profit when stocks drop. As with funds that benefit from volatility, however, the secret to success is the perilous art of timing your bets.
The ProShares Short S&P 500 ETF, for example, offers investors the inverse of the daily return of the S&P 500, including dividends. If the index loses 1% in a day, the fund should gain about 1%, and the profits and losses can diverge to some extent and compound over time for investors who hold the fund for longer periods.
For example, the ProShares fund is up 1.3% over the past month, through Thursday, while the S&P 500 has fallen 1.5% over that period. But the fund is down 8% year to date, compared with a 7.3% return for the S&P 500. The fund has $1.8 billion in assets and charges annual fees of 0.89%.
The ProShares fund can help insulate investors. In 2008, during the financial crisis, the fund rose 39%. But it has dropped every year since, including a nearly 26% decline last year, as stocks recovered.
A similar ETF, the ProShares Short Dow30, places a narrower bet on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has lagged behind the S&P 500 this year.
-- Striking a balance. Investors who have no special insight into what the stock market will do nonetheless have ways to cushion their portfolios.
One of the simplest options is a balanced fund that holds chunks of both stocks and bonds in hopes that the stocks will provide growth and the bonds some measure of insurance because their prices often rise when stocks fall.
The Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, for example, had 56% of its assets in stocks such as Apple and Exxon Mobil, as of Sept. 30, and the rest in U.S. Treasurys and other bonds as well as some cash. The fund is down 0.3% over the past month, through Thursday, but up 5.9% year to date.
A similar fund, the Fidelity Balanced Fund, had 72% of its assets in stocks and the rest in bonds, cash and other investments as of Sept. 30. The fund is down 1% over the past month, but up 6.3% this year.
These types of funds have attracted wide interest. The Vanguard fund has $23.2 billion in assets and the Fidelity fund has $26.6 billion. The annual fee on Admiral shares of the Vanguard fund is 0.09%, and the fee is 0.58% for the Fidelity fund.
The returns on a balanced fund may not be anything to brag about. But if wild rides are what bother you, it may be a calmer place to park your money.

Pandora Hits A Discordant Growth Note

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Competition may be catching up to Pandora Media. And that isn't its biggest hurdle.
The Internet music service's third-quarter results slightly beat estimates. It also raised guidance. But user-growth issues and worries about rising content costs drowned out those positive notes.
Pandora only added a net 100,000 active users over the previous quarter. That compares with sequential step-ups of 1.6 million and 3.8 million in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Pandora has added only a net 300,000 users in 2014's first nine months.
The company said "an increasingly competitive environment" would make driving monthly user growth more difficult. Yet analysts forecast net user additions of around nine million in 2015. That will require higher marketing expenses and may not be enough amid competition from the likes of Apple's iTunes Radio.
Pandora maintains it can eventually reach 100 million monthly active users, up from 76.5 million at the end of the third quarter, with help from trends like more car installations. It said listening hours, which rose 25% year over year in the quarter, are a more important measure of engagement. But there is a limit to how much those can rise without user growth.
And content costs, about 50% of revenue, are a big unknown. The government board that dictates royalties paid by Internet radio providers won't conclude its rate-setting process until December 2015. Pandora wants a sizable decrease in its per-song rate, while SoundExchange, representing artists, wants a big increase. Meeting in the middle would mean a 35% rise in 2016 content costs, says SIG Susquehanna Financial Group.
Even if Pandora's rates do end up falling, that much uncertainty tends to hurt investors' ears.

REVIEW --- Moving Targets: Dear Corporations, Don't Forget to Write

I'm always getting calls -- some live, some recorded -- from companies or mutual funds asking for my vote on board proposals. The people who call, live or recorded, are always very nice and genuinely interested in my opinions. The message they transmit is: We are not some cold, impersonal behemoth sitting in cyberspace. We are flesh and blood. And we care.
Why, then, did Bill Gross jump ship at Pimco without letting me know? I've got about one-tenth of my 401(k) socked away in that Total Return Fund of his, but last month the guy just bailed on me. No heads-up, no bittersweet adieu; he just up and left. Nor did Pimco itself see fit to send me an explanatory note, or even a little conciliatory message assuring me that things were going to be all right. Even though other shareholders were cashing out left and right.
"We were going to fire the bum anyway," the note might have read. "The dude was getting way too flaky."
When a company wants to change one of its bylaws or policies, it often calls me up or sends me a nicely worded letter, asking if I support the board's resolution. But when the guy who got Pimco off the ground in the first place, with help from little guys like me -- when this big shot abruptly decided to take a hike -- I got nothing but silence.
Not to get all touchy-feely about this, but I think of Pimco as a friend. I really do. I like those guys out in Newport Beach, Calif. They've been good to me. They're my bros. But now I feel like they've just totally dissed me. And Pimco isn't the only company that has recently given me the high hat.
Last month, when Apple decided to force-feed iTunes users the new U2 album, nobody bothered to tell me. As a shareholder in this legendarily arrogant corporation, I was left red-faced and sputtering, having to defend the company's insolent behavior to friends who hate the company and really hate U2 and know that I own Apple. For the record, I hate U2 too. Something about Bono's shades. And that weird hair color of his. His 'do looks worse than Springsteen's.
It's the little things that count in life, and I don't think some companies understand this. When I've got a nice chunk of change invested in Microsoft, I would like a little bit of advance notice that they are going to ditch the friendly Windows interface and replace it with something ghastly. Or that they are going to spend a couple billion dollars on a videogame company I never heard of.
If Disney is going to bankroll some stupid Hercules film starring the Rock just a few months after somebody else released a stupid Hercules film, I think the least they could do is drop me and all the other faithful shareholders a line in advance. If Merck or Pfizer is going to sideline a controversial drug, could someone give me a heads-up? For old time's sake?
And if one of the energy companies I own stock in is planning to frack its way right across the Keystone State, could somebody give me a holler, so I can remember not to tell any of my relatives in Harrisburg that I own stock in the company? Finally, could Nokia or Motorola occasionally send me a little note saying: "Disregard what you may have heard, Joe. We still exist."
I really, really like the companies I invest in. They've been like friends to me. But investing is a two-way street, and I expect a little love in return. If I had poured a hundred grand into one of my friends' businesses, he wouldn't change jobs without letting me know he was leaving. And if one of my friends threatened to download U2's new album onto my computer or my iPod, he wouldn't do it without asking first. That way, I could say, "Could you download the new Tony Bennett/Lady Gaga album instead? I hate Bono's hair."

Apple's CEO Unveils Plans To Expand Inside China

Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook told a Chinese media outlet that the company's four Beijing retail stores serve about 250,000 customers a week. A Business & Finance article in the Friday-Sunday edition about Apple's plans in China incorrectly stated that Mr. Cook said it serves 750,000 customers a day in 15 Apple-branded stores across China.
(WSJA Oct. 27, 2014)
(END)
BEIJING -- Apple Inc. plans to increase the number of its Apple-brand retail stores in Greater China to 40 from 15 within two years, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday.
In an interview with Chinese news portal Sina.com, Mr. Cook said the Cupertino, Calif., company will also increase investment in China by an unspecified amount. "In the future, China will become Apple's biggest revenue contributor," he said, according to Sina.com. "It's just a matter of time."
An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the remarks. Greater China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.
China is Apple's third-largest market after the U.S. and Europe and is an important growth driver for the company. Its revenue growth in Greater China, however, slowed sharply in the latest quarter ahead of the release of its new iPhone, which was delayed by regulators in China until this month.
Mr. Cook's trip is being portrayed by some Chinese media outlets as part of the company's attempt to assuage concerns the Chinese government or public might have about the security of data stored on its phones. In July, state broadcaster China Central Television called a location-tracking function on the iPhone a "national security concern." Apple has said it doesn't keep user data.
The official Xinhua News Agency said Mr. Cook and China's Vice Premier Ma Kai "exchanged views on protection of users' information" when they met on Wednesday.
Apple faces competition in China from South Korean company Samsung Electronics Co. as well as Chinese manufacturers. Apple ranked No. 6 in China's smartphone market in the second quarter, according to research firm IDC.
Mr. Cook said Apple has 7,000 employees in China serving 750,000 customers daily in 15 Apple-branded stores. "You could say they're the world's busiest retail stores," he said.

Stocks: How to Play Defense; Specialized Funds Designed to Hedge Risk May Not Be the Best Choice

The stock market has been taking investors on a white-knuckle ride in recent weeks. Some of the ways investors try to manage volatility can be nerve-racking, too.
The S&P 500 has fallen more than 1% six times and risen more than 1% five times since the index hit an all-time high on Sept. 18. By contrast, there weren¡¦t any such single-day swings between Aug. 9 and Sept. 24.
Jittery investors are worried about the U.S. economic recovery, higher interest rates and slow growth in Europe, among other issues. Strong gains in recent years have boosted share prices and stoked concerns that stocks are priced too high.
The market upheaval has put a spotlight on strategies investors can use to try to protect themselves from steep losses in a downturn. For example, a handful of funds allow investors to profit from volatile moves and log gains when stocks fall.
But the share prices of such funds can just as quickly leap or fall. ¡§You don¡¦t just plunk them in a portfolio for the long term,¡¨ says Eric Dutram, an analyst who tracks exchange-traded funds at Zacks Investments, a research firm based in Chicago.
For investors who just want to smooth out a bumpy ride, the better bet may be a balanced fund that holds a mix of stocks and bonds. Here¡¦s what you need to know about each approach.
The wagers of fear. Financial whizzes look for signs of volatility in stock prices by watching the Chicago Board Options Exchange¡¦s Volatility Index, or VIX, informally known as the fear gauge.
The VIX tracks near-term volatility as measured by S&P 500 index options prices. A high VIX means stock prices are more likely to fluctuate¡Xand often decline. As recently as July, the VIX was at its lowest level since 2007, before the financial crisis.
But the index has spiked recently, which has benefited investors in funds that track the VIX. The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Exchange-Traded Note, which has $968 million invested, gained 15% over the past month, through Thursday, according to Chicago-based investment researcher Morningstar. Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments backed by the issuer that promise to pay a return based on the performance of a market measure.
A similar fund, the ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, which has $90 million invested, is up 14% over the same period.
The iPath note charges annual fees of 0.89%, or $89 on a $10,000 investment, while the ProShares fund charges 0.83%.
But such products also can lose big in periods of calm, such as when stocks are gaining steadily or basically flat, which makes them unsuitable for most buy-and-hold investors. The iPath note, for example, fell nearly 78% in 2012 and 67% last year. Even with its recent gains, the note is down 21% year to date, according to Morningstar.
The risks are real even for investors who watch their portfolios carefully, because it is difficult if not impossible to consistently predict when stocks will be calm or volatile.
Down is the new up. Some funds aim to profit when stocks drop. As with funds that benefit from volatility, however, the secret to success is the perilous art of timing your bets.
The ProShares Short S&P500 ETF, for example, offers investors the inverse of the daily return of the S&P 500, including dividends, minus fees. If the index loses 1% in a day, the fund should gain about 1%, and the profits and losses can diverge to some extent and compound over time for investors who hold the fund for longer periods.
For example, the ProShares fund is up 1.3% over the past month, through Thursday, while the S&P 500 has fallen 1.5% over the same period. But the fund is down 8.0% year to date, compared with a 7.3% return for the S&P 500. The fund has $1.8 billion in assets and charges annual fees of 0.89%.
The ProShares fund can help insulate investors. In 2008, during the financial crisis, the fund rose 39%. But it has dropped every year since, including a nearly 26% decline last year, as stocks recovered.
A similar ETF, the ProShares Short Dow30, places a narrower bet on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has lagged behind the S&P 500 this year.
Striking a balance. Investors who have no special insight into what the stock market will do nonetheless have ways to cushion their portfolios.
One of the simplest options is a balanced fund that holds chunks of both stocks and bonds in hopes that the stocks will provide growth and the bonds some measure of insurance because their prices often rise when stocks fall.
The Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, for example, had 56% of its assets in stocks such as Apple and Exxon Mobil, as of Sept. 30, and the rest in U.S. Treasurys and other bonds as well as some cash. The fund is down 0.3% over the past month, through Thursday, but up 5.9% year to date.
A similar fund, the Fidelity Balanced Fund, had 72% of its assets in stocks and the rest in bonds, cash and other investments as of Sept. 30. The fund is down 1% over the past month, but up 6.3% this year.
These types of funds have attracted wide interest. The Vanguard fund has $23.2 billion in assets and the Fidelity fund has $26.6 billion. The annual fee on Admiral shares of the Vanguard fund is 0.09%, and the fee is 0.58% for the Fidelity fund.
The returns on a balanced fund may not be anything to brag about. But if wild rides are what bother you, it may be a calmer place to park your money.

Roku Working on Plans to File Confidentially for IPO; Potential Offering Could Raise as Much as $150 Million

Roku Inc., maker of streaming media players, TVs, and software, is working on plans to file confidentially for an initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.
The company has been working with investment banks including Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Inc. on preparing for a potential offering that could raise as much as $150 million, the people said. The timing of any deal isn¡¦t yet set, and it also isn¡¦t yet clear what valuation Roku might seek, they added.
Roku, founded in 2002, became known to consumers through small boxes that hook up to TVs and stream video from services including Netflix Inc. and Hulu. Its business grew as some people ¡§cut the cord¡¨ and canceled their cable-TV service. Roku said in September that it had sold 10 million streaming video players in the U.S.
The market for streaming media players is still growing rapidly, expected to rise from 24 million units in the U.S. this year to 44 million by 2017, according to research firm IHS Inc. While Apple Inc.¡¦s Apple TV and Roku dominate that market, with a combined 94% share, new devices from Google Inc. and others could make it more competitive, IHS said.
More recently, Roku has expanded into other businesses, including Roku televisions produced with other manufacturers. It also partners with cable companies to provide software, and now aims to sells advertising space on its platform, according to recent company statements.
The Saratoga, Calif.-based company has so far raised more than $150 million in private capital from investors including some of the companies it partners with, such as Netflix and British Sky Broadcasting, Roku has said. It has also raised money from Hearst Corp., Fidelity Investments, Menlo Ventures and News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal.
In early October, CEO and founder Anthony Wood told publication the Information that Roku generated $190 million in revenue in 2013, and was ¡§getting closer¡¨ to profitability.
Companies are generally eligible to file confidentially for IPOs in the U.S. if they have less than $1 billion in annual revenue.
Mr. Wood is a former Netflix executive and founder of several media companies.
Though IPOs in the past few weeks have struggled amid a broader market correction, the market has been welcoming to new offerings from consumer technology firms recently. Camera maker GoPro Inc. is trading up around 200% since its June IPO, and Mobileye NV, which makes camera safety systems for cars, is up around 100% from its August debut.

TAIPEI, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd said Friday it was reviewing its investment plans after media reports said the major Apple Inc supplier may invest up to $5.7 billion in a factory to make smartphone displays in China.
On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Hon Hai was in talks with the government of Zhengzhou, in Henan province, about investing as much as 35 billion yuan in a new factory that would make high-end screens for iPhones and other mobile devices.
Local media in Taiwan also carried similar reports on Friday.
In a stock market filing responding to the reports, Hon Hai said: "The company's investment plans after going through a necessary review process will be submitted to the board and will be handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
Media officials for Hon Hai, which is also known by its trade name Foxconn, declined to comment further.
Hon Hai is the world's largest electronic contract manufacturer and assembles the majority of Apple's new iPhone 6 and the bigger-screen 6 Plus model.
This week, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook toured Hon Hai's existing factory in Zhengzhou as part of a visit to China. ($1 = 6.1190 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by J.R. Wu; Editing by Miral Fahmy)

Uncool Microsoft Grows Hot Again

Microsoft Corp. may not be cool, but its sales continue to defy expectations by growing at a much faster clip than those of its business-technology peers.
Microsoft's revenue rose 11% from a year earlier in the three months ended Sept. 30, excluding Nokia's mobile-phone business that Microsoft purchased last spring.
Meanwhile, competitors in corporate technology -- such as International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Oracle Corp. -- posted shrinking or slow sales growth.
"Microsoft is bucking the trend," said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets.
Microsoft's stock rose 3.1% in after-hours trading Thursday following the release of its financial report for the fiscal first quarter. The company's stock price has reflected strong revenue and profit growth in the past year.
Shares climbed 33% in the past year through Thursday's market close, far outpacing the S&P 500 stock index over the period.
The company's market value recently surpassed that of Google Inc. for the first time since June 2013.
The latest quarterly results continue a charmed first year in office for Satya Nadella, who in February was named chief executive, only the third in Microsoft's history.
Mr. Nadella has focused on many of the same lines of business as his predecessors, and earlier investments in cloud computing and the Xbox videogame console have paid off under his watch.
Mr. Nadella has won over Wall Street with his willingness to cut jobs, favor innovation over existing businesses and de-emphasize products outside Microsoft's core offerings.
In the most recent quarter, Microsoft's revenue from software for business customers rose more than 9.5% from a year earlier.
The company had robust growth in both newer offerings such as Microsoft Office 365 (an online version of the popular desk-jockey software suite) and mature products like the version of Windows for computer servers.
Cloud software sold to businesses -- primarily Office 365, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM sales tool and the Azure cloud-computing service -- more than doubled to $1.18 billion, or roughly 5.1% of total revenue for the quarter.
But Microsoft executives said during a conference call that customers for Azure, which lets corporate IT departments and software developers rent computing horsepower and storage capacity by the hour, also buy the company's traditional corporate software.
Microsoft's mobile business remains a trouble spot. Sales of Windows-powered Nokia smartphones rose, but the company continues to lose market share to Apple Inc. and manufacturers of phones that run Google's Android operating software.
Microsoft made less money than it did a year earlier from its mobile-phone operating software business, largely because Android-phone makers such as Samsung Electronics Co. sold more of their inexpensive phones, which generate lower fees for Microsoft. Android phone makers pay Microsoft a royalty for Microsoft patents used in the Google operating system.
Sales of Windows operating software for personal computers also declined, but less than in prior quarters, driven by improving demand for PCs since their 2013 swoon.
The company made more headway with its other consumer hardware products.
Revenue more than doubled for the Surface tablet computer, which sold poorly when it launched two years ago. The Surface Pro 3, released in June, received a more positive reception, the company said. The newer device is positioned more as a laptop replacement than a tablet computer.
Microsoft also sold twice as many Xboxes as a year ago, it said, helped by a $100 price cut for the latest model.
Despite Microsoft's recent successes, Google tends to get the buzz once reserved for the Redmond, Wash., company.
In an interview, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood was unfazed. "I wasn't that cool in high school, either," she said.
Overall in the quarter, Microsoft revenue was $23.2 billion, including the Nokia business, compared with $18.5 billion a year ago. Net income fell to $4.5 billion, or 54 cents a share, from $5.2 billion, or 62 cents, in the same quarter last year.
Microsoft's profit was weighed down by about $1.1 billion, or 11 cents a share, in part due to costs related to a massive round of job cuts Mr. Nadella pushed through this summer.

UNILEVER
Consumer-Brands Firm
Posts Slow Sales
Unilever PLC on Thursday warned of a tough global outlook and struck a gloomy tone after reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth in five years, raising fears of a continued economic slowdown across emerging markets.
The maker of Magnum ice cream and Dove shampoo posted third-quarter underlying sales growth of 2.1%, down markedly from 3.2% in the same period a year earlier and marking the Anglo-Dutch consumer-product company's worst performance since the fourth quarter of 2009.
Underlying sales growth, which was 3.8% in the second quarter, is adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange-rate changes.
"It is really tough out there. We have been at pains to say that for a long period of time," said Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Huet, citing the impact of both price deflation and weak sales demand across key markets.
Revenue in the quarter fell 2% to 12.2 billion euros ($15.4 billion), hit by a 2.6% negative currency impact, compared with a market consensus forecast of around 14 billion euros. Profit figures weren't disclosed.

CHIQUITA
Brazilian Firms Raise
Counteroffer to Fyffes
Brazilian firms Cutrale-Safra on Thursday raised their bid for Chiquita Brands International Inc. by an additional 4% as the banana company's shareholders prepare to vote Friday on its proposed tie-up with Irish food company Fyffes PLC.
Cutrale-Safra, a coalition of a Brazilian orange-juice maker and an investment firm, raised their offer for Chiquita to $14.50 a share, up from the increased offer of $14 a share it made last week. The new bid values the company at $742 million.
Chiquita responded by saying it would carefully review the offer.
Cutrale-Safra first entered the bidding for Chiquita in August with a bid valued at $666 million, or $13 a share. Chiquita's board has rejected both of Cutrale-Safra's previous bids as too low.
Cutrale-Safra's 11th-hour bid came as Chiquita continued to pursue its planned merger with Irish banana grower Fyffes, a tie-up that would create the world's largest banana seller.

HYUNDAI HEAVY INDUSTRIES
Union Backs Possible
Strike Next Month
Unionized workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries late Wednesday endorsed a possible strike over wage and benefit issues, threatening to halt production at the world's biggest shipbuilding company for the first time in 20 years.
About 18,000 union members, or two-thirds of the South Korean shipbuilder's total workforce, overwhelmingly voted to walk off the job as early as next month, said union spokesman Kim Hyung-gyun on Thursday.
"Despite the vote result, union leaders will try to seek a negotiated wage deal with the management this week. But if the company doesn't accept our demand, we have no other choice but to go on strike," he said.
A company spokesman said both sides would meet later Thursday and intense negations could start as early as Friday.
If workers strike, it will be the first affecting Hyundai Heavy since 1994 when a 63-day stoppage cost it 530 billion won ($522 million).

APPLE
More Stores to Arrive in
China Within Two Years
Apple Inc. plans to increase the number of its Apple-brand retail stores in Greater China to 40 from 15 within two years, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday.
In an interview with Chinese news portal Sina.com, Mr. Cook said the Cupertino, Calif., company will also increase investment in China by an unspecified amount. "In the future, China will become Apple's biggest revenue contributor," he said, according to Sina.com. "It's just a matter of time."
An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the remarks. Greater China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.
China is Apple's third-largest market after the U.S. and Europe and is an important growth driver for the company. Its revenue growth in Greater China, however, slowed sharply in the latest quarter ahead of the release of its new iPhone, which was delayed by regulators in China until this month.

Corporate News: Apple Ex-Retail Chief Leads Startup

Ron Johnson, who helped build Apple Inc.'s successful retail stores before a troubled stint as chief executive of J.C. Penney Co., is getting back in the game with a well-funded startup that aims to bring some of the Apple Store mystique to online shopping.
The new company is called Enjoy, and Mr. Johnson says its goal is to change the way people buy and use the "things that matter" in a world in which consumers start their shopping online. The service is scheduled to start in 2015.
In a move reminiscent of his old boss at Apple, Steve Jobs, Mr. Johnson is keeping most of Enjoy's plans and strategy secret to avoid tipping off rivals.
But he said Enjoy aims to help shoppers develop a connection with new products, in the way that Apple Stores let shoppers try its products. For example, Mr. Johnson said it is hard for customers to understand the capabilities of a new product like a GoPro camera from shopping online.
As Amazon.com Inc. and Google Inc. jostle to sell everyday items on the Web and deliver them as quickly as possible, Mr. Johnson says they overlook the human aspect of helping shoppers find the right products, especially for infrequently purchased items that are more complex and expensive.
"That's when you typically want something more than fast delivery; you might want a little help," Mr. Johnson said in an interview. "There's a place for high touch in a high-tech world."
He has sold some big-name investors on his vision. Enjoy has raised $30 million, including a recent $25 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Oak Investment Partners. Andreessen Horowitz is also an investor. Mr. Johnson declined to disclose Enjoy's valuation.
A one-time executive of Target Corp., Mr. Johnson was the architect of Apple's retail strategy, which aimed to establish a deeper connection with customers. The minimalist stores allowed people to touch and try Apple's computers. The stores also feature a Genius Bar that provides technical advice or help in setting up new products. The strategy worked: Apple Stores generate more sales per square foot than any other retailer, including luxury brands like Tiffany & Co.
Mr. Johnson left Apple in 2011 to become the CEO of J.C. Penney. But his efforts to overhaul stores and cut back on discounting led to a massive drop in sales. The company ousted Mr. Johnson in April 2013.
He said he took a "one-year sabbatical," spending time speaking to entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. During those conversations, he said, he realized that while customers start shopping online, e-commerce sites focus more on the speed and cost of delivery than on helping them buy the right products.
"Just because we're moving online, it doesn't mean that need for a connection is going away. No one has really thought that through yet," he said.
Last month, technology-news site The Information said Mr. Johnson was launching a high-end delivery service for gadgets and dispatching employees in energy-efficient branded vans. Without going into specifics, Mr. Johnson said: "We don't need another delivery service."
Mr. Johnson has recruited a team of well-known executives to Enjoy, including Jerry McDougal, a former retail vice president at Apple.

Post-Handset Nokia Forges On

STOCKHOLM -- Nokia Corp.'s quarterly earnings signaled that the company's main network unit has moved well beyond several years of painful restructuring.
The former handset giant gave a more bullish full-year outlook Thursday after swinging to a profit in the third quarter. Its earnings were boosted by a 13% rise in revenue, as the Finnish telecom-equipment supplier deployed high-speed mobile networks in North America and China.
Nokia's net profit in the quarter was 747 million euros ($945 million), compared with a 91 million euros loss a year earlier, helped also by a large tax gain. Revenue increased to 3.32 billion euros.
"Progress was widespread, with four of our six regions increasing sales," Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said.
Mr. Suri has led Nokia's mobile-network unit since 2009 and was appointed as Nokia's CEO in late April this year, as the company transferred its unprofitable phone business to Microsoft Corp. Without the handset business, Nokia is now a mobile-network firm competing with Huawei Technologies Co. and Ericsson. Nokia also has a Berlin-based digital-mapping operation and a large number of patents.
Nokia's mobile-network arm, which until recently was plagued with overcapacity and losses after a difficult merger with Siemens AG's mobile-network unit, has staged a comeback and is benefiting from deals with China Mobile Ltd. and Sprint Corp., which are ramping up their high-speed mobile Internet services.
Nokia said it expects a full-year operating-profit margin of slightly above 11%, having previously forecast a margin in the high single digits. It confirmed that it expects net sales for its main networks unit to grow on a year-to-year basis in the second half of 2014.
Nokia's stock rose sharply Thursday on the Helsinki stock exchange after the earnings release, finishing the day 3.5% higher at 6.74 euros.
The Finnish company booked a 2 billion euros tax benefit in the quarter, which was partly offset by a 1.2 billion euros goodwill impairment charge related to its HERE digital-mapping unit.
Unlike Google Inc. and Apple Inc.'s mapping services, Nokia's platform largely targets corporate customers, like auto makers and logistics-dependent businesses such as FedEx Corp., that pay licensing fees. Still, Nokia is about to release free-of-charge map apps for consumers using mobile devices running Google Inc.'s Android and Apple Inc.'s iOS platform.
Mr. Suri said he isn't in favor of running advertisements on Nokia's mapping service, as Google does, and that the business will remain geared toward enterprise customers and the automotive industry. He added that while its mapping operation might appear an odd fit next to Nokia's network business, the company is a suitable owner of the unit.
"Nokia is a good owner of HERE, we have a balance sheet that can help the operation," he said, adding that combining advanced high-speed network technology with a mapping asset can assist developers of autonomous cars, for instance.
In a separate announcement on Thursday, Nokia said it would appoint Sean Fernback as the new president of its HERE unit. Mr. Fernback, a former TomTom NV executive, joined HERE earlier this year and will succeed Michael Halbherr, who stepped down and left the unit in August.

Foxconn Aims to Make Screens for iPhones in China
By Lorraine Luk

HONG KONG -- Foxconn Technology Co., the company that assembles the bulk of the world's iPhones, is in preliminary talks to build a factory in northern China that would make high-end screens for the phones as well, in a sign of the Taiwan-based company's ambition to move up the electronics food chain.
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is discussing a possible investment with the government of Zhengzhou, according to people familiar with the talks. The two sides are discussing terms such as how to divide the investment, which could reach as much as 35 billion yuan ($5.7 billion), the people said. The company already has a factory in Zhengzhou -- about 750 kilometers south of Beijing -- that mainly assembles the latest iPhones and makes components such as metal casings.
The two sides haven't yet formulated a concrete investment proposal, they said. If an agreement is reached, it could be Foxconn's biggest direct investment to date in high-end parts manufacturing.
It remains unclear whether iPhone maker Apple Inc. or other investors are being approached to invest in the display plant.
Currently, Apple uses screens made by suppliers in South Korea and Japan.
The development highlights Foxconn's ambition to supply more expensive components to key customers like Apple. While Foxconn, with revenue of $130 billion last year, has been manufacturing some iPhone components already, like metal casings and cables, mobile displays are much more difficult to make and have higher margins.
That is important to Foxconn, whose sales rose only 1% last year, compared with 53% annual growth five years ago, while operating profit margin growth slowed to 2.8% in 2013 from 4.4% in 2009.
Foxconn also is looking for more sources of revenue since Apple, whose orders account for nearly half of its sales, is starting to outsource production of some of its iPhones and iPads to rivals including Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp.
With $19 billion in cash as of the end of June, Foxconn has the hefty amount of capital needed for an investment in advanced manufacturing facilities.
For Apple, buying displays from Foxconn would help the company diversify its screen suppliers beyond Japan's Sharp Corp. and Japan Display Inc. and South Korea's LG Display Co.
"Foxconn hopes to capture the growing demand for high-resolution, energy-efficient displays and supply Apple and other smartphone makers in the next few years," said a person familiar with the situation.
Apple declined to comment.
To be sure, Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou is known for making ambitious statements and floating investment ideas that sometimes don't materialize.
In 2012, Mr. Gou acquired a 50% stake in a Sharp Corp. display factory in Sakai, Japan, and at the same time Foxconn agreed to take a 10% stake in the Japanese company for 66.9 billion yen, or $819 million. Foxconn pulled out of the deal after Sharp's share price fell sharply. In January, speaking at the company's 40th anniversary gathering, Mr. Gou said Foxconn is studying the feasibility of building an advanced-panel manufacturing plant in the U.S., though no details have emerged since.
Foxconn also has floated the idea of building a manufacturing plant for components and handsets in Indonesia, and Mr. Gou said he would consider investing at least $1 billion during a February visit to Jakarta. Last month, Foxconn said it is still reviewing the potential investment, while Indonesian Finance Minister Chatib Basri told The Wall Street Journal that the plan is stalled over unrealistic demands from Foxconn, including free land and import protections.
"The chairman always has lots of new business and investment ideas and he is also approached by many government officials," said a Foxconn official. "Only a few of them materialize as the chairman wants favorable terms that most governments can't accommodate."
Foxconn has had more success in China, where it has more than 10 manufacturing sites that employ more than one million workers.
Thanks to strong demand for bigger-screen iPhones, Foxconn has been heavily recruiting workers in Zhengzhou, where it has been producing about a half million iPhones a day, people familiar with the matter said.
According to the people, Mr. Gou visited Zhengzhou in August, where he met government officials to discuss the investment proposal. Foxconn General Manager Wu Yi-Wei, who leads the display operation, also went to Zhengzhou with a team to survey the site last month, the person said.
Mr. Gou has said he wants Foxconn to be a major player in the display industry.

OFF DUTY --- Adventure & Travel -- Journal Concierge: Warsaw --- Explore behind the facade to find a 'lovely old gal' of a city

Warsaw has long been seen as the ugly stepsister of Krakow. While Krakow gets all the invites and accolades -- pretty, special, sweet -- the Polish capital is forgotten, seen as nondescript and cold. But scratch beneath the surface and Warsaw is a dynamic and lovely old gal.
The city's attractions aren't initially obvious, so you have to tease them out -- some of the best bars, for example, are hidden behind unassuming courtyards. Warsaw was largely destroyed during World War II and while the Old Town (Stare Miasto) was lovingly reconstructed brick-by-brick by Varsovians, the rest of the city was largely built up quickly in a gray Modernist style. Those buildings -- long loathed for their Communist design -- are now being heralded. What's more, the city is full of cranes, as expensive new residential spaces like Z??ota 44, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, are being built, and historic properties such as the Hotel Europejski (built in the 1850s and expected to reopen in 2015) are redeveloped.
Praga, long seen as the "wrong side" of the river, is becoming gentrified by attractions like the Soho Factory complex, located at Minska 25, one of the coolest addresses in the entire capital thanks to its art galleries, design firms, theater, shops and a swanky 24-hour restaurant. The city also boasts some fantastic eateries -- including Poland's first Michelin-starred restaurant, Atelier Amaro -- as well as high-end boutique shopping at Vitkac. Art venues and museums are plentiful, and will be added to next week with the opening of the Polin Museum of the History of Polish Jews' permanent collection. Like a pearl, the grit of Warsaw's past and the power of its modern innovation have created something truly worth seeking out.

Fewer-than-expected listeners tune in to Pandora in third quarter

(Reuters) - Pandora Media Inc, operator of the leading Internet radio service, reported a lower-than-expected increase in listeners in the third quarter, sending the company's shares down 8 percent in extended trading on Thursday.
Pandora said it had 76.5 million active listeners as of Sept. 30, an increase of 5.2 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts, on average, had expected 76.7 million, according to market research firm StreetAccount.
Total listener hours rose to 4.99 billion from 3.99 billion, but again fell short of the average estimate of 5.02 billion.
"In an increasingly competitive environment, driving monthly active user growth will be more challenging particularly given our already significant market position," Chief Executive Brian McAndrews said on a call with analysts.
"As a result, looking ahead, expecting monthly active user growth at the historic levels is not realistic."
Despite its huge user base, Pandora faces stiff competition in the fast-growing business from services such as Spotify, Sirius XM, Apple Inc's Beats online streaming service, Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc.
Pandora's profit and revenue both beat market expectations, however, as more people listened to streamed music on their mobile phones.
Mobile revenue increased 52 percent to $188 million, while local advertising revenue rose 118 percent to $41.8 million.
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD
Rising listener numbers are a double-edged sword for Pandora - the more listeners it has, the more it has to pay in royalties to artists and record labels.
SoundExchange, which collects royalties on behalf of artists and labels, offered a proposal last week that could greatly increase Pandora's royalty rates from 2016.
"Pandora has paid more than $1 billion in cumulative royalty payouts, and a highest rate among any form of radio," Chief Financial Officer Mike Herring said on the call.
"We are confident that we have put together the best economic and legal team to represent Pandora and provide a solid, fair and logical argument regarding the (SoundExchange) reproposal," Herring said.
Pandora reported an adjusted profit of 9 cents per share, on revenue of $239.6 million. Analysts on average expected earnings of 8 cents per share on revenue of $238.49 million, according Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company raised its full year revenue forecast to $912 million-$917 million, from $895-$915 million.
It also increased its adjusted net profit estimate to 19-21 cents per share from 16-19 cents.
Pandora's shares were trading at $21.27 after the bell, after closing at $23.12.

World News: Hong Kong: Banker Airs Frustration, Interrupting Live Webcast

A senior J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. banker walking to lunch on Wednesday interrupted a live round table webcast on Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests to express his frustration over the continued street blockage.
David Lau, who heads the U.S. investment bank's China corporate finance division, walked into the interview with protest leaders and a democracy advocate that was being streamed by local paper Apple Daily, live from the Admiralty protest site.
"Hong Kong has many people who are against Occupy Central," said Mr. Lau. "The fact that a majority of people are against Occupy . . . but that you guys continue to occupy the sites, that's most undemocratic of all."
He ignored attempts by the program's host to stop him, and continued speaking for nearly two minutes, though he never lost his cool during the interruption.
Mr. Lau is a veteran banker who has handled many China-related initial public offerings, including the US$2 billion listing in Hong Kong of Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group. He is currently helping handle the US$500 million Hong Kong IPO by Hong Kong Airlines.
Mr. Lau's identity wasn't known to the host and the program guests at the time. "Do you think you're being democratic? There's a show going on and then you just come in to interrupt us," said Martin Lee, founding chairman of Democratic Party, who was one of the guests.
"People are trying to get to work, and you've blocked off the streets. That's not democratic either, is it?" Mr. Lau asks. J.P. Morgan's main offices in Hong Kong are blocks away from the main protest site. "Of course, there are those who support and those against Occupy. I just want to express the views of the silent majority. Thank you everyone," Mr. Lau said, before quickly walking away.
Mr. Lau on Thursday told The Wall Street Journal that he was on his way to a lunch meeting and walked through the protest site. He said he just wanted to express his views, noting that he didn't realize the conversation was being streamed live.
Still, Mr. Lau's comments come even as an opinion poll released this week showed increasing support for the students and less support for their opponents. The poll by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that 38% of respondents supported the protesters in October, up from 31% in September. More significantly, the portion of the population that doesn't support the protesters dropped to 36% from 46% in September.
J.P. Morgan said Thursday that Mr. Lau's comments were his personal opinions and don't represent the bank's views.

Apple, GT Advanced Technologies in Agreement on Sapphire Materials; Apple Supplier to Wind Down Sapphire-Materials Production in Two States

GT Advanced Technologies Inc. and Apple Inc. announced Thursday they reached an agreement on terms for the wind-down of sapphire-materials production in GT¡¦s Mesa, Ariz. and Salem, Mass. locations.
First mentioned in court, the pact is termed a ¡§settlement¡¨ by Apple, which didn¡¦t use sapphire from GT Advanced for its latest-generation smartphones.
In a statement from an Apple spokeswoman, the company said, ¡§Apple put a lot of effort into an ambitious new sapphire-manufacturing process with GTAT which is not ready for production. We¡¦re going to continue evaluating GTAT¡¦s progress on larger sapphire boule development, as well as consider other options for the facility. We remain committed to the city and we¡¦re going to work with Mesa and Maricopa County to help the GT Advanced employees who will be impacted by this find new jobs.¡¨
After filing for Chapter 11 protection Oct. 6 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manchester, N.H., GT Advanced said it would get out of the business of making sapphire materials.
GT Advanced chief executive Tom Gutierrez said in a statement that the company is working ¡§to develop a restructuring plan that will allow us to emerge from Chapter 11 as quickly as possible and with the operating flexibility and resources to position GT for long term success.¡¨
According to a news release from GT Advanced, the settlement with Apple releases GT from ¡§exclusivity obligations under its various agreements with Apple.¡¨ GT will own ¡§production, ancillary and inventory assets located in Mesa¡¨ under the pact. Apple, in return, gets ¡§a mechanism for recovering its $439 million prepayment made to GT.¡¨
At a time when Apple was considering using GT Advanced¡¦s synthetic sapphire material in the screens for its iPhones, the technology giant extended $578 million worth of financing to set GT Advanced up in the business. Some $439 million of the money had been advanced before GT Advanced filed for bankruptcy. Apple used Corning Inc.¡¦s Gorilla Glass for its new iPhone screens.
The settlement also provides that Apple and GT Advanced release all claims against each other. What those claims might be remains to be seen.
GT Advanced Technologies agreed to the settlement weeks into a case where critical court papers remain under seal. Court papers that set out, on the one hand, the reason for GT Advanced¡¦s surprise bankruptcy filing, and, on the other hand, Apple¡¦s position on the relationship between the two companies, were filed under seal.
That has left creditors and shareholders wondering what, if anything, their claims are worth in a bankruptcy that caught them by surprise. A GT Advanced spokesman Thursday did not respond to questions about whether the Chapter 11 proceeding will leave unsecured creditors and shareholders with any value.
Dow Jones & Co, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, U.S. Trustee William Harrington, a Department of Justice lawyer charged with monitoring the bankruptcy courts, and New Hampshire Attorney General Joseph Foster have challenged the secrecy in the case as illegal.
GT Advanced has said terms of its contract with Apple, a contract it has moved to terminate, could expose it to $50 million in damages for breaching confidentiality provisions. Apple has not filed papers explaining what it seeks to protect by keeping the papers under seal. Instead, GT Advanced and Apple struck a settlement that depends on getting a court order striking from the court record all copies of GT Advanced¡¦s explanation of its bankruptcy, and Apple¡¦s position on the contract. The court order will also require anyone in possession of the documents to destroy all copies.
The settlement papers haven't yet been filed with the bankruptcy court, which is being asked to approve them. According to the news release, GT Advanced will file those papers Monday with a hearing on the deal slated for Nov. 25.

Consumer-Brands Firm Posts Slow Sales
Unilever PLC on Thursday warned of a tough global outlook and struck a gloomy tone after reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth in five years, raising fears of a continued economic slowdown across emerging markets.
The maker of Magnum ice cream and Dove shampoo posted third-quarter underlying sales growth of 2.1%, down markedly from 3.2% in the same period a year earlier and marking the Anglo-Dutch consumer-product company¡¦s worst performance since the fourth quarter of 2009.
Underlying sales growth, which was 3.8% in the second quarter, is adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange-rate changes.
¡§It is really tough out there. We have been at pains to say that for a long period of time,¡¨ said Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Hu?t, citing the impact of both price deflation and weak sales demand across key markets.
Revenue in the quarter fell 2% to £á12.2 billion ($15.4 billion), hit by a 2.6% negative currency impact, compared with a market consensus forecast of around £á14 billion. Profit figures weren¡¦t disclosed.

Brazilian Firms Raise Counteroffer to Fyffes
Brazilian firms Cutrale-Safra on Thursday raised their bid for Chiquita Brands International Inc. by an additional 4% as the banana company¡¦s shareholders prepare to vote Friday on its proposed tie-up with Irish food company Fyffes PLC.
Cutrale-Safra, a coalition of a Brazilian orange-juice maker and an investment firm, raised their offer for Chiquita to $14.50 a share, up from the increased offer of $14 a share it made last week. The new bid values the company at $742 million.
Chiquita responded by saying it would carefully review the offer.
Cutrale-Safra first entered the bidding for Chiquita in August with a bid valued at $666 million, or $13 a share. Chiquita¡¦s board has rejected both of Cutrale-Safra¡¦s previous bids as too low.
Cutrale-Safra¡¦s 11th-hour bid came as Chiquita continued to pursue its planned merger with Irish banana grower Fyffes, a tie-up that would create the world¡¦s largest banana seller.

Union Backs Possible Strike Next Month
Unionized workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries late Wednesday endorsed a possible strike over wage and benefit issues, threatening to halt production at the world¡¦s biggest shipbuilding company for the first time in 20 years.
About 18,000 union members, or two-thirds of the South Korean shipbuilder¡¦s total workforce, overwhelmingly voted to walk off the job as early as next month, said union spokesman Kim Hyung-gyun on Thursday.
¡§Despite the vote result, union leaders will try to seek a negotiated wage deal with the management this week. But if the company doesn¡¦t accept our demand, we have no other choice but to go on strike,¡¨ he said.
A company spokesman said both sides would meet later Thursday and intense negations could start as early as Friday.
If workers strike, it will be the first affecting Hyundai Heavy since 1994 when a 63-day stoppage cost it 530 billion won ($522 million).

More Stores to Arrive in China Within Two Years
Apple Inc. plans to increase the number of its Apple-brand retail stores in Greater China to 40 from 15 within two years, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday.
In an interview with Chinese news portal Sina.com, Mr. Cook said the Cupertino, Calif., company will also increase investment in China by an unspecified amount. ¡§In the future, China will become Apple¡¦s biggest revenue contributor,¡¨ he said, according to Sina.com. ¡§It¡¦s just a matter of time.¡¨
An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the remarks. Greater China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.
China is Apple¡¦s third-largest market after the U.S. and Europe and is an important growth driver for the company. Its revenue growth in Greater China, however, slowed sharply in the latest quarter ahead of the release of its new iPhone, which was delayed by regulators in China until this month.

GT Advanced shareholders see value in stock despite bankruptcy

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
Oct 23 (Reuters) - Shareholders of GT Advanced Technologies are lobbying regulators to form a committee to vouch for their interests in the sapphire maker's bankruptcy, believing their shares may still have value.
GT Advanced, which supplied sapphire to Apple Inc, filed for Chapter 11 protection this month under mysterious circumstances, sending shares plummeting.
The case boggled the minds of market analysts when GT refused to explain why it had imploded, citing confidentiality clauses in its Apple contracts.
While shareholders are typically wiped out in bankruptcy, GT Advanced stockholders believe their equity may not be worthless. Some are reaching out to the U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy regulator, the U.S. Trustee Program, asking it to form a committee in GT's bankruptcy to represent shareholder interests.
According to a source close to the effort, law firm Brown Rudnick, which routinely represents creditors in big Chapter 11 cases, is drafting a letter to the Trustee on behalf of a shareholder group requesting a committee.
Other shareholders, like Nathan Cottrell, are working independently. Cottrell, a Philadelphia-based IT salesman, told Reuters he's reached out to the Trustee's office to request a committee and been in touch with law firms about representation.
GT has "a lot of other product lines that are about to start firing up," Cottrell said in an interview on Thursday. "I believe there's value for equity."
The odds may not be in shareholders' favor. Official creditors' committees, appointed by the Trustee and paid for by the debtor, are only formed when the Trustee feels the creditor group in question has a decent shot at recovery.
Since stockholders of bankrupt companies are usually out of the money, equity committees are rare, and shareholders tend not to have a unified voice in Chapter 11 cases.
The company's stock no longer trades on the Nasdaq, but still trades over the counter at a price that currently values GT at $72 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Early in GT's case, company attorney Luc Despins said GT "feels terrible" about the loss to shareholders and "will work every day to recover that value."
The Trustee has yet to make a decision on an equity committee, and a spokeswoman for the office declined to comment on Thursday. Despins, meanwhile, did not return a call seeking comment.
One reason for lingering uncertainty over equity value may be the refusal by GT to disclose the specifics of its downfall, which has drawn the ire of creditors and regulators, the Trustee included.
GT has said it plans to shut down key sapphire operations in Mesa, Arizona, laying off hundreds and reorganizing around a smaller business.
Creditors are hoping for some clarity on the company's financial picture in the coming days, when GT has said it will file a proposed settlement agreement with Apple that may detail its collapse.
Shareholders this month sued the company's officers and directors, accusing them of providing misleading information about stock and bond offerings. (Reporting by Nick Brown; editing by Andrew Hay)

Pandora Media Loss Narrows; Listener Hours Up 25%; Advertising Revenue Rises 44% to $194.3 Million

Pandora Media Inc. reported a 25% increase in the number of hours listeners tuned in during the third quarter, the first year-to-year comparison since the Internet radio giant ended its 40-hour free-listening monthly cap.
Advertising revenue, radio¡¦s bread and butter, rose 44% to $194.3 million, with local advertising more than doubling to $41.8 million from the year-earlier period.
While revenue has been growing strongly, Pandora, which went public in 2011, has struggled to post a profit as listener growth brought along higher royalty fees to music labels and the company faces stiff competition in a crowded field that includes Spotify Ltd., Sirius XM Radio Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.
Pandora has boosted its sales force by about 70 over the past 12 months and on Wednesday launched an analytics tool, AMP, that allows the roughly 125,000 musicians on Pandora to access listener data, such as age and gender, and map where fans are.
On Thursday, Pandora again raised its earnings projection for the year to 19 cents to 21 cents a share on revenue of $912 million to $917 million, from its previous estimate of 16 cents to 19 cents a share on revenue of $895 million to $915 million.
For the current quarter, the company expects a profit of 17 cents to 19 cents a share on revenue of $273 million to $278 million, compared to the Wall Street consensus of 17 cents a share on revenue of $272.8 million.
Overall, the Oakland, Calif., company reported a loss of $2 million, or a penny a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.1 million, or two cents a share. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, Pandora reported a profit of nine cents a share, up from five cents a year earlier.
Revenue rose nearly 42% to $239.6 million.
In July, the company had projected earnings of five cents to eight cents a share for the quarter on revenue of $235 million to $240 million.
Total operating expenses rose 48%.
At quarter¡¦s end, Pandora¡¦s active listeners reached 76.5 million, up 5.2% from a year earlier, while its share of U.S. radio listening in September reached 9.06%, up from 7.77% a year earlier.
Shares, which peaked at $40.44 in March, fell nearly 2% in recent after-hours trading. The company¡¦s stock is down 13% for the year.

Why You Can¡¦t Trust You¡¦re Getting the Best Deal Online; A Study Finds Discriminatory Pricing on E-Commerce Sites Is More Widespread Than Thought

The Web is full of personalized content, whether it¡¦s a Netflix recommendation or the results of a Google search.
But consumers have protested when e-commerce companies have extended their behind-the-scenes personalization to prices, charging different sums for the same goods, or pushing some people toward higher-priced offers.
A new study of top e-commerce websites found these practices¡Xcalled discriminatory pricing or price steering¡Xare much more widespread than was previously understood.
The study, by a team of computer scientists at Northeastern University, tracked searches on 16 popular e-commerce sites. Six of those sites used the pricing techniques; none of the sites alerted consumers to that fact.
Among the study¡¦s findings: Travel-booking sites Cheaptickets and Orbitz charged some users searching hotel rates an average $12 more per night if they weren¡¦t logged into the sites, and Travelocity charged users of Apple Inc.¡¦s iOS mobile operating system $15 less for hotels than other users.
Home Depot Inc. shows mobile-device users products that are roughly $100 more expensive than those offered to desktop-computer users. And Expedia and Hotels.com steer users at random to pricier products, the study said.
¡§In the real world, there are coupons and loyalty cards, and people are fine with that,¡¨ said Christo Wilson, an assistant professor at Northeastern who led the research team. ¡§Here, there¡¦s a transparency problem. The algorithms change regularly, so you don¡¦t know if other people are getting the same results.¡¨
Travelocity, a unit of Sabre Corp., didn¡¦t respond to a request for comment.
Home Depot didn¡¦t dispute the accuracy of the findings, but the home-improvement retailer wasn¡¦t ¡§intentionally steering search results,¡¨ said company spokesman Stephen Holmes.
Many factors could influence what a customer sees on the company¡¦s sites, Mr. Holmes said, including prior browsing and purchase history, the location of the store, and whether the customer is on mobile or not.
Home Depot didn¡¦t charge users different prices for identical products but showed more-expensive products to people who shopped using a smartphone, the researchers found.
Chris Chiames, vice president of corporate affairs at Orbitz Worldwide Inc., said in an email that the company clearly advertises its loyalty programs and other deals. He said the discounts some members see on the site apply to just a small proportion of hotels¡Xfewer than 5%. So, it wouldn¡¦t make sense, and might even be misleading, to advertise lower prices to all members, he said.
¡§The Northeastern study states that ¡¥overall, most of the experiments do not reveal evidence of steering or discrimination,¡¦ and so we are curious as to why a handful of exceptions to searches on thousands of hotels is the basis of this paper¡¦s conclusions, or even worthy of a story,¡¨ Mr. Chiames added. ¡§Would you be as interested in a Kmart ¡¥blue light special¡¦ deal that was made available to shoppers who happen to be in a certain store at a certain time?¡¨
Moreover, some deals are priced by Orbitz¡¦s hotel partners, he added. ¡§The hotel might have limited inventory of that price, and so they choose to display the rate on a more-limited basis, akin to the flash sale,¡¨ he said.
On Orbitz and Cheaptickets, also owned by Orbitz Worldwide, consumers who registered through the websites¡¦ free log-in were shown a tab labeled ¡§members only¡¨ that offered lower hotel prices. The company didn¡¦t advertise that users could receive discounts for logging in.
Orbitz has been accused of price discrimination in the past. A 2012 Wall Street Journal investigation found the company charged Mac users as much as 30% more than PC users for a night¡¦s lodging. The company discontinued the practice, which it characterized as a month-long experiment. The Northeastern researchers confirmed the company no longer discriminates between Mac and PC users.
Expedia and Hotels.com, both units of Expedia Inc., don¡¦t show different prices because of users¡¦ differing characteristics but because the company constantly refines its pricing strategies using a method called A/B testing, the researchers said. Shoppers are randomly placed in a group that highlights either less or more costly hotels. ¡§Either way, the user has no idea what bucket they¡¦ve been placed in,¡¨ said Northeastern¡¦s Mr. Wilson.
One group of users, for example, were shown an average hotel listing price of $187 a night. The other group saw prices that were $17, or roughly 10%, less.
¡§Presenting different booking paths and options to different customers allows us to determine which features customers appreciate most¡¨ said Expedia spokesman Dave McNamee, in an email. ¡§Pricing is not manipulated by Expedia.com.¡¨
Consumers have long protested price discrimination. In 2000, Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos apologized for an internal research program in which consumers were shown different prices for identical products. He called the experiment a ¡§mistake.¡¨ (Amazon and eBay Inc. weren¡¦t included in the Northeastern study because those companies¡¦ services have little power over the prices they charge, the researchers said.)
Staples Inc. varied its online prices based on users¡¦ locations, according to a 2012 article in The Wall Street Journal. The researchers didn¡¦t examine Staples but pointed out that retailers might vary prices by region because the cost of procuring a given product can differ in different parts of the country. They didn¡¦t study geographic variations for that reason.
In their study, the Northeastern researchers devised a statistical method to weed out what they called ¡§noise,¡¨ or legitimate factors that might cause prices to vary¡Xa technique they hope will be used in future studies of online personalization.
The research team recruited 300 beta users, who allowed the researchers to track their experience on different sites.
The team also developed hundreds of fake accounts to see whether historical purchase patterns and clicks through the sites had an impact on price personalization. They didn¡¦t examine the impact of consumers¡¦ overall Web-browsing behavior on pricing because they would have no way to know how e-commerce sites tracked participants across the Web.
