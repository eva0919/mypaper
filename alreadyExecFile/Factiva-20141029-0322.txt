HSINCHU, Taiwan¡XAt Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., hundreds of engineers have joined a newly instituted overnight shift. Their task is to come up with advanced technology to mass produce some of the world¡¦s most intricate computing chips in the shortest time possible.

Pressure is looming over the world¡¦s biggest contract chip maker by revenue, which makes the computing brains for smartphones and other gadgets. As mobile devices become smaller and more powerful, TSMC and rivals are racing neck-and-neck to pack more computing power into each chip.

Taiwan-based TSMC is preparing for an uphill battle in the coming year as rivals¡¦ more-advanced chips are set to hit the market sooner. Intel Corp., the world¡¦s biggest semiconductor maker, is entering the so-called chip foundry business¡Xmaking chips based on others¡¦ designs¡Xto expand the use of its plants and has secured clients such as Panasonic Corp. and Altera Corp. Morris Chang, TSMC¡¦s 83-year-old chairman, is also preparing for a leadership succession, trying to plan a smooth transition to his two co-chief executives.

¡§This is a war. I am not leaving anything to chance,¡¨ Mr. Chang, who founded the company in 1987, said in an interview at TSMC¡¦s headquarters, located in the south of Taipei.

TSMC was one of the first major chip makers to move to 20-nanometer chip process technology last year. A chip¡¦s transistor components and the spaces between them are measured in nanometers¡Xa billionth of a meter. The smaller the space between components, the more powerful the chip.

That transition allowed TSMC to produce more powerful chips than most rivals at lower costs, and helped it beat out Samsung Electronics Co. for a massive order from Apple Inc. for iPhones. Thanks to Apple, which is seeing strong demand for its smartphones, TSMC¡¦s revenue rose to a record US$6.88 billion in the third quarter, its second consecutive quarterly high. On Thursday, the company is expected to report a 40% jump in net profit, according to analysts¡¦ estimates, likely setting a new high.

Still, Mr. Chang concedes that both Intel and rival Samsung will be months ahead of TSMC in adopting the next-generation chip process technology. TSMC plans to mass-produce its chips with 16-nanometer technology from the third quarter next year.

By comparison, Intel, the world¡¦s biggest chip maker by revenue, has said devices using its 14-nanometer chips will be available in October, while Samsung plans to mass produce chips on the same technology by the end of this year.

¡§TSMC would lose some orders to Samsung next year because of the lag, but we hope to recoup some of the lost businesses in 2016,¡¨ he said, noting that TSMC plans to deliver a prototype 10-nanometer chip based on ARM Holdings PLC¡¦s design in the fourth quarter of next year.

To migrate to finer process technology, chip makers typically invest billions of dollars in capital expenditure. Since 2009, TSMC has spent around $10 billion every year building advanced facilities. It has also increased its portion of revenue for research and development to about 8%.

But rivals are just as aggressive. Samsung last week announced plans to invest $14.7 billion in a new facility in South Korea that is slated to begin mass production of advanced chips in the second half of 2017. And in nearby China¡Xthe world¡¦s largest consumer of semiconductors, according to McKinsey & Co.¡Xthe government has pledged up to $170 billion over the next five to 10 years to build up its domestic semiconductor industry, which analysts say could become a threat to Taiwanese chip makers longer term.

¡§The 10-nanometer [project] is a must-do for the company. It¡¦s going to be a lot more expensive than previous generations of technology, in both research and development and capital requirement,¡¨ Mr. Chang said.

The technological race isn¡¦t the only thing that is keeping Mr. Chang up at night. He is a rare top executive who is still actively running a $20 billion technology company at his age.

In November 2013, Mr. Chang promoted Mark Liu and CC Wei as co-chief executives, hoping one of them will become his successor ultimately. He handed over research, sales and client relations to them, but he is still overseeing what he calls the hardest parts of running a chip business¡Xstrategy, capital investment, pricing and capacity allocation.

Mr. Chang said the transition is going to be gradual and could take years. To begin with, he has assigned 20 to 30 major clients to his two co-CEOs, and put them in charge of major decisions involving them.

Mr. Chang¡¦s first attempt to retire in 2005 didn¡¦t succeed. Even though he named his prot?g? at the time, Rick Tsai, as his successor, the company was soon hit by rising competition and then, in 2009, by the global financial crisis. Mr. Chang was forced to return in the summer of that year and made the bold decision to quadruple TSMC¡¦s capital spending.

¡§I do care about TSMC a great deal, that¡¦s why I came back five years ago. So that¡¦s part of my succession issue. I want to pass it on to somebody who also cares.¡¨

Corrections & Amplifications

In November 2013, Mr. Chang promoted Mark Liu and CC Wei as co-chief executives. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the month of the promotions as January of this year.

Intel gains a new ally in China's chip wars - Beijing

BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Intel's investment of up to $1.5 billion in two fast-growing Chinese mobile chipmakers has effectively aligned the U.S. giant with a third party - a Beijing government intent on producing a viable domestic challenger to the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung.

For more than a decade, China has targeted semiconductor design and manufacture as a major focus of its industrial policy. Activity has picked up markedly over the past year with a spate of cross-border mergers and cooperation deals.

"We've entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it's started to help the local semiconductor industry," said Nomura analyst Leping Huang.

The deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel's beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company's years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.

A key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal.

The agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips.

China is the world's largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co , or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan.

China's ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance programme PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry.

For Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world's biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets.

Intel spokesman John Mandeville declined to comment.

NATIONAL TARGETS

The China Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that revenue from China's chip industry reached 251 billion yuan($40.98 billion) in 2013, while domestic demand for chips amounted to 917 billion yuan, representing more than half of global semiconductor consumption.

Deng Zhonghan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and National People's Congress, said in March that China's $210 billion worth of annual chip imports exceeds the value of the country's entire yearly petroleum imports.

In June, the State Council offered the country's most comprehensive guidelines for the development of the semiconductor industry, outlining specific revenue targets for 2015 and 2020, with chip revenue set to grow at a better-than 20 percent annual clip, to reach 350 billion yuan by 2020.

An important part of Beijing's effort, analysts and industry insiders say, was consolidation of Spreadtrum and RDA, two companies formerly trading independently on Nasdaq.

The two companies were acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion and $900 million respectively by Tsinghua Unigroup, government-affiliated private equity group controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing.

As part of its recent deal, which is expected to close early next year, Intel and Unigroup will form a new holding company that contains Spreadtrum and RDA.

Beijing wants the Unigroup companies to become competitive with Taiwan's MediaTek within five years and overtake Qualcomm within 10 years, according to a person familiar with Unigroup.

TRUE PARTNERS

Since taking over in 2013, Krzanich has aggressively positioned Intel to catch up with Qualcomm, the leading mobile chipset maker.

A central part of that strategy is China, where consumers are snapping up low-end smartphones made with low-cost chips from local suppliers like Spreadtrum and MediaTek.

Intel started investing in local operations 20 years ago, and presently operates factories across the country for manufacturing, assembling and testing microprocessors. Intel also has research and development operations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.

In May, Intel said it reached an agreement with Fuzhou-based Rockchip to produce chips for tablets based on Intel's architecture.

"With China, what they want is for you to be a true partner," Krzanich told reporters in September. "We go in and we partner, we build factories, we build R&D and we help local companies."

Intel's deal with Tsinghua Unigroup comes three months after Qualcomm agreed to partner with Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest foundry, to produce some of Qualcomm's smartphone chips.

As part of the agreement, Qualcomm will help SMIC implement its first high-end 28 nanometre manufacturing technology.

It also coincides with a year-long Chinese anti-monopoly investigation into Qualcomm. Critics say the probe unfairly targets foreign companies in order to help domestic companies, which Chinese authorities flatly deny.

Krzanich first discussed ways to collaborate with the Chinese firms during a visit to Tsinghua University in April, where he and Intel China head Yang Xu met Tsinghua Holding's Xu Jinhong, Unigroup's Zhou Weiguo, Spreadtrum founder Li Liyou, who is also a Tsinghua University alumnus.

He made a second trip to Beijing, the whirlwind visit in August, after which the deal fell into place.

"Tsinghua University is an important driving force for the development of national science and technology, and Tsinghua Holdings is a key part of that effort," Tsinghua Holdings Chief Executive Xu Jinhong told Reuters by email.

Xu characterized the Intel investment as "a new model for cooperation between Chinese and U.S. companies in the chip industry."

Analysts say that Intel's deal will give the Santa Clara-based company a moderate boost by gaining a partner with strong relationships with local phone manufacturers.

The deal should also give Intel enough protection of its intellectual property through licensing arrangements and other conditions, said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Centre for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University.

"There's potential benefits for everyone," Kennedy said. (1 US dollar = 6.1250 Chinese yuan) (Additional reporting by Michael Martina and Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Alex Richardson and Emily Kaiser)

MARKETS AT A GLANCE

(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)

SNAPSHOT

U.S. stocks tumbled in volatile trading following last week¡¦s sharp selloff, reflecting investors¡¦ growing anxiety. The Treasury market was closed for a holiday. The dollar weakened on guarded Fed signals. Global oil prices dropped to a near four-year low amid OPEC discord. Gold futures rose on safe-haven buying.

OPENING CALL

With a light Asian data calendar Tuesday, Singapore¡¦s central bank may grab some attention as it releases its latest monetary-policy statement. The announcement, incidentally, comes on same day Singapore¡¦s government releases its third-quarter advance GDP estimate. Barclays expects the Monetary Authority of Singapore to keep its currency stance unchanged. Meanwhile, economists, an average, see GDP advancing at a 2.8% pace year over year in the third quarter, up from the 2.4% pace seen in the second quarter.

EQUITIES

U.S. stocks took another tumble amid volatile trading and following last week¡¦s sharp selloff, showing the growing anxiety of investors.

Energy companies were among the biggest decliners, as Brent oil futures, the international benchmark, dropped to a four-year low after some of the biggest oil exporters indicated they would maintain current production levels even as prices fall.

Among the worst performers were exploration-and-production companies and oil services companies, including EOG Resources, which fell 6.8%, and Halliburton, which declined 7.4%.

Early in the day, traders said investors were reluctant to place big bets ahead of the deluge of corporate-earnings reports to be released this week. In the quarterly reports investors are looking for solid revenue figures and guidance as reassurance that the U.S. economy is on track despite global growth concerns, traders and strategists said.

¡§People want to see what the earnings picture is going to look like,¡¨ said Keith Bliss, senior vice president at brokerage Cuttone & Co.

In the absence of hard news about market fundamentals, traders said, investors instead reacted to afternoon rumors of Ebola spreading.

¡§The market hates uncertainty and this is the ultimate uncertainty. I don¡¦t know how to handicap it,¡¨ said Seth Setrakian, co-head of trading at First New York Securities. ¡§People are looking at headlines and rumors and would rather sit out the hurricane and come back and play when there¡¦s sun again.¡¨

He said the fears were weighing on shares of airline companies. United Continental Holdings dropped 7.3%, while Delta Air Lines fell 6.1%.

Dramatic price swings ruled the market last week, with stocks facing their most volatile stretch since 2011 on concerns about the pace of global growth, but traders and strategists say as this week continues corporate earnings should be the focus. Among the big companies expected to report earnings are J.P. Morgan Chase on Tuesday, Netflix on Wednesday and Google on Thursday.

Marc Doss, regional chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank, which manages $179 billion, said he is looking for positive comments in quarterly reports from U.S. financial companies to help boost confidence in the U.S. economy and lift the equities market. In addition to J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are also expected to report earnings Tuesday before the market opens.

¡§The lifeblood of our economy is still banking and finance,¡¨ Mr. Doss said. ¡§This week¡¦s financials earnings will hopefully show that the U.S. economy is still healthy and there is still risk-taking.¡¨

Also playing into Monday¡¦s move lower is the S&P 500 index falling below its 200-day moving average, a market timing indicator.

¡§The 200-day moving average is what a lot of people use as a benchmark for general health of the market,¡¨ says Frank Longman, managing director of equity trading strategies at Brean Capital. When an index falls below this trend line, ¡§it tends to wake people up.¡¨

In corporate news, shares of CSX Corp rose 5.9% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Canadian Pacific Railway approached the railroad operator about merging.

Auto retailer Lithia Motors¡¦ shares fell 21% after it warned its third-quarter earnings will be lower than expected, in part because of higher selling costs.

In Asian trading Monday, stocks accelerated their decline, with Taiwan and the Philippines each tumbling more than 2.5%, as worries over slowing global growth weighed on shares.

FOREX

The dollar weakened against the yen, euro and most developed-market currencies in light trade after the Federal Reserve signaled a cautious approach to raising interest rates over the weekend.

Mounting concerns over global growth, which last week pummeled stock markets and pushed down bond yields, have clouded the market¡¦s timeline for the Fed¡¦s first increase in interest rates in more than eight years. Over the weekend, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said at the International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington that the impact on the U.S. economy of weaker-than-expected foreign growth could cause ¡§the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise.¡¨

¡§The markets have been turning more cautious on the U.S. economy and the Fed, and the dollar¡¦s a little weaker from that,¡¨ said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas.

Investors await September U.S. retail-sales numbers on Wednesday and the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Oct. 28-29.

In other trade, the dollar fell against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, as well as most emerging-market currencies as strong September trade data in China boosted investor confidence enough to move into assets perceived as risky.

BONDS

The cash Treasury market was closed Monday for Columbus Day.

Looking ahead, this week¡¦s run of U.S. data may give an inconclusive picture, analysts at Commerzbank said.

¡§The data are likely to remain noisy with strong data in the previous month set to correct lower (retail sales, regional Fed surveys) and previously weak data set to correct higher (housing starts, industrial output),¡¨ they said.

COMMODITIES

Global oil prices dropped to near a four-year low, with investors and traders bracing for more declines after some of the world¡¦s biggest crude exporters signaled they would keep production steady despite the slide in prices.

Discord increased over the weekend among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, lowering traders¡¦ expectations that the cartel would collectively cut oil production to boost prices at its next meeting in November.

On Monday, Brent oil, the international benchmark fell 1.5%, to settle at $88.89 a barrel, the lowest closing price since December 2010. U.S. oil prices slipped 0.1% to $85.74, a 22-month low. The price drop has been a boon to U.S. drivers, who are seeing the lowest gasoline prices of the year, and has hammered shares of energy companies.

Many investors set low odds for oil to pull out of its swoon without unified action from OPEC. Global production has soared, fueled by increasing output from U.S. shale-oil drilling, while demand has been lackluster. Oil prices have tumbled more than 20% since mid-June.

Gold advanced to its highest level in nearly four weeks as worries about global economic growth weakened the dollar and spurred investor appetite for a haven.

European Telecoms Providers Gear Up for Connected Wireless Fight; ¡¥Internet of Things¡¦ Seen as a Prime Source of New Revenue by European Telecoms Firms

Europe¡¦s largest telecommunications providers are gearing up for a battle in the lucrative race to connect cars, homes, utilities and other everyday devices to smartphones and other wireless devices.

The ¡¥Internet of Things¡¦ market is the catchall term for an electronic device which can be wirelessly connected to the Internet. For years, AT&T Inc. and rival Verizon Communications Inc.¡¦s Verizon Wireless have lead the charge for U.S. telecom operators, and have seen niche IoT services such as parcel tracking expand into global businesses.

But after seeing their core telecom revenue growth being outstripped by ¡§machine-to-machine¡¨ businesses, and with traditional revenue streams being stretched by tough market conditions, Europe¡¦s telecoms firms are seeing IoT as a prime source of new revenue.

¡§We are one of the few parts of the organization that grows,¡¨ says Telef?nica SA¡¦s global IoT chief Surya Mendon?a.

According to network systems firm Cisco, the IoT market is expected to grow into a $19 trillion market over the next 10 years, as IoT networks for sectors such as traffic systems, shipping, rail freight and industrial manufacturing take shape. Meanwhile, the number of IoT-focused developers will leap to 4 million in 2020 from 300,000 this year, says telecom group Interoute.

And it¡¦s at this junction that the telecom companies are skirmishing with technology giants like ARM Holdings PLC, Samsung Electronics Co., Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Both telecom and technology are levering ¡§hardware, the ubiquitous nature of connectivity, big data and analysis¡¨ in a face-off to grab IoT¡¦s expanding revenues, says Chris Gray, analyst at U.S. software firm Red Hat Inc.

Google, Apple and Samsung have made recent inroads into homes. This year, Google bought Nest Labs, Apple is launching HomeKit and Samsung acquired SmartThings to allow users to control home settings and sync devices.

Telecoms have significant skin in the game. IoT technology works on sensors and SIM cards inside devices linked to data servers over cellular networks. Data is sent over radio waves via the SIM, sometimes via another radio transmitter. External software applications like smartphone apps pick up the signals and use the data to control devices-like cars telling garages to open as they approach a home.

The need for comprehensive mobile network coverage to power the connections between devices means the telecom companies, which are investing billions of dollars to upgrade mobile infrastructure, are in prime position.

For Telef?nica, Vodafone Group PLC, Orange SA and Deutsche Telekom AG, the importance of not being left behind in the race for ¡§machine-to-machine¡¨ business means deal-making for Internet-enabled connected services and devices is stepping up, analysts say.

Connected cars is one of the most active sectors for both intra-telco competition as well as competition with tech giants.

Telef?nica has a partnership with electric car maker Tesla in major European markets and connects General Motors vehicles through the car group¡¦s communications unit OnStar. Orange also works with Tesla, in France, alongside other deals with Peugeot and Renault. Orange is also launching smartphone service Orange Drive next year, which gives users voice-activated radio controls and tips on efficient driving.

Vodafone has signed up with Germany¡¦s BMW and, in August, bought Italian car services firm Cobra Automotive. Deutsche Telekom also partners with BMW, and last Friday joined China Mobile, the world¡¦s largest mobile provider, in a connected cars venture.

Smart homes are another battleground. Last month, Telef?nica launched a trial of AT&T¡¦s home security, automation and energy management platform in Europe. Deutsche Telekom has built on the 2011 launch of smart home platform Quivicon to control appliances through partners like Samsung and wireless speaker maker Sonos.

Orange¡Xnot to be left behind by the offerings of Google, Apple, and Samsung¡Xwill launch Homelive, incorporating applications with weather monitors, thermostats and movement detectors, later this month.

Telecoms are also eyeing utilities, hoping to capitalize on the market as energy regulation tightens. Last year, Telef?nica struck a 15-year deal worth ?1.5 billion to connect smart meters in the U.K., while Vodafone is working with energy supplier Npower to install smart meters in the country.

Orange is working with France¡¦s EDF to monitor electricity consumption, worked by a sensor inserted into the meter. The service will launch in France next year. And Deutsche Telekom also partners with energy and technology firms for meter reading services in Germany.

* Singapore likely to keep tight monetary policy
    * Won up on China data, stop-loss dollar selling

 (Adds text, updates prices)
    By Jongwoo Cheon
    SINGAPORE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The Singapore dollar led gains
among emerging Asian currencies on Monday, as solid China trade
data eased concerns over a slowing global economy and the U.S.
dollar slid on dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials.
    Singapore's dollar advanced as the central bank is
expected to maintain its tight monetary policy on Tuesday.
 
    China's exports in September grew more than market
expectations while imports surprisingly expanded, alleviating
worries about deteriorating domestic demand in the world's
second-largest economy. 
    The greenback slid against a basket of six-major
currencies after several Fed officials on Friday said a sluggish
global economy could delay U.S. interest rate hikes if the
slowdown is serious enough. 
    Still, Asian shares fell to seven-month lows, indicating
investors stayed concerned over faltering global growth. That
will keep putting pressure on regional currencies, analysts
said.
    "The near-term bias for Asian currencies is likely to remain
skewed towards further weakness," said Jonathan Cavenagh, senior
FX strategist with Westpac in a client note.
    "Global equity market sentiment has softened noticeably and
this creates the risks of further equity market outflows from
the region." 
    
    SINGAPORE DOLLAR
    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will likely stick
to its stance of allowing a "moderate and gradual" appreciation
of the Singapore dollar as core inflation has picked up, a
Reuters poll showed last week. 
    That comes even as the city-state's economy has slowed on a
sluggish manufacturing sector and weak exports.
    "They still have adequate room to allow the index to drift
into the weak end of the band without officially changing their
stance," said Emmanuel Ng, a foreign exchange strategist for
OCBC Bank in Singapore, referring to the Singapore dollar
nominal effective exchange rate.
    The MAS is set to announce its semi-annual policy decision
at 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Tuesday.
    
    WON
    The won started local trade weaker, dampened by concerns
over a slowing global economy.
    The South Korean unit turned firmer on stop-loss dollar
selling and after solid China trade data eased worries over the
global economic outlook. China is South Korea's top overseas
market.
    Samsung Heavy Industries Co LTD said it had won
a 664 billion won ($622.1 million) ship order, prompting
expectations of more won demand. 
    "We may see further stop-loss dollar offers, so the won may
head to 1,065," said a foreign bank trader in Seoul.

Chaebol Style: Oversight Scarce in Hyundai Deal

By In-Soo Nam

When Hyundai Motor Co.'s board convened last month to discuss the company's planned land purchase in Seoul, its five independent directors sought details.

"Does Hyundai need the land for sure? Why is the company going to buy it in an expensive Gangnam area?" an outside director said he asked at the meeting. "Is there no other choice?"

Executives replied that Hyundai needed to house about 30 of its affiliates under one roof to improve efficiency. The conglomerate also would build an automobile theme park at the new location to enhance its brand image, they said.

One thing they didn't provide: the price.

The $10 billion cost, three times the property's assessed value, was disclosed only after the nine-member board unanimously endorsed the plan. The figure was made public after the deal was done.

"Company executives were desperate to persuade outside directors to approve it at the board meeting. For Hyundai, the land wasn't just an investment, it was something the company couldn't afford to lose," said an independent director who attended the meeting. "In that case, price didn't matter."

The deal was the latest example of how South Korea's conglomerates, known as chaebols, are raising the ire of shareholder activists seeking to change corporate decision making.

Investors have long complained about a lack of transparency and outside oversight at many chaebols, which generally are controlled by founding families through complex cross-shareholdings. Top managers typically wield power in major corporate decisions, such as capital spending, despite having relatively small shareholdings in key operations.

After Hyundai's purchase was announced, angry investors who thought the deal was a waste of money dumped the company's stock. Shares of Hyundai and the two affiliates that joined the purchase, Kia Motors Corp. and Hyundai Mobis Co., each fell more than 10% in a few days after the announcement. The declines reduced their combined market value by more than the amount paid for the land.

"This is a classic example of Korea's weak corporate governance and poor oversight by outside directors. Hyundai wanted the land and directors rubber-stamped it," said Kim Sang-jo, a professor at Hansung University and the executive director of Solidarity for Economic Reform, a group that advocates for improved corporate governance. The group, which has an undisclosed minority stake in each of the three companies, obtained the minutes of their board meetings.

According to the minutes, Hyundai Chairman Chung Mong-koo wasn't at the meeting, Mr. Kim said. Mr. Chung had privately pushed for the land purchase for years but never took the matter to the board for discussion, an outside director said. It was common for Mr. Chung to skip board meetings, some outside directors said.

"It only took 30 minutes for the board to discuss and approve such a big deal. That means the meeting was just a formality," Mr. Kim said. Board meetings usually last about two hours, one of the outside directors said.

Hyundai declined to comment on the decision-making process or Mr. Chung's activity, and he wasn't available for comment.

Mr. Kim said Hyundai's process reflected typical practice at chaebols.

Independent directors, usually scholars, lawyers and former government officials, tend to go along with what company owners want because the directors are chosen by committees composed of the businesses' family members and company executives, Mr. Kim said. He proposes a system in which shareholders can evaluate the performance of outside directors and hold them responsible for decisions that lead to stock declines.

Chaebols have played a significant role in South Korea's economy, which is Asia's fourth-largest. Wanting to rebuild the nation quickly after the 1950-'53 Korean War, the government drew up blueprints for industrial expansion and offered generous favors, such as loan guarantees to big businesses, which helped fuel rapid growth.

Nam Sung-il, a professor of economics at Sogang University, said family-run business structures have merits, such as quick decision making on tough issues and long-term investments by owners that can see a company through crises.

But weak corporate governance caused the nation to become one of the most vulnerable to the 1997-'98 Asian financial crisis, observers said. Daewoo group and 10 other businesses collapsed between 1997 and 1999. The government in 1998 ordered companies to strengthen outside oversight by filling almost half of the board seats with outsiders, adopting a model from U.S. and Europe after an outcry that inappropriate oversight by directors was partly responsible for the fallout.

Korea's corporate-governance scores slipped the most among 944 surveyed companies because of the rise in intergroup transactions and poor disclosure, according to a recent report by brokerage firm CLSA and the Asian Corporate Governance Association.

While Korean companies such as Hyundai and Samsung Electronics Co. have become household names world-wide, their stocks still trade at much lower multiples than those of their peers from elsewhere. The benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index traded at 10.9 times its price-to-earnings multiple last year, compared with 17.4 for the U.S., 14.7 for Japan and 15.8 for Hong Kong, according to Korea Stock Exchange.

In an effort to rein in chaebol influence, President Park Geun-hye's government has offered tax incentives to conglomerates that simplify their ownership. The government in July banned the creation of new cross-shareholdings, although it didn't address existing structures.

"In the first few months of President Park's administration, she appeared to take a stance against chaebols under the name of economic democratization, but there have been no significant changes in corporate structures at big conglomerates," said Chae Yi-bae, a researcher at the Center for Good Corporate Governance. "Frankly, I don't remember any governments in the past that have succeeded in reforming chaebols."

Oct 12 (Reuters) - Shares of Samsung Electronics  appear cheap and could gain as much as 50 percent, Barron's financial newspaper said in its latest edition.               

Samsung's stock has fallen 19 percent this year due to plunging profits in its mobile phone business and it hit a 52-week low on Friday after a warning about its third-quarter profit earlier in the week.               

But there appears to be little downside to owning a piece of the world's largest maker of handsets, as its memory chip business could generate an operating profit of $10 billion next year, compared with $8 billion this year, Barron's said in its Oct. 13 issue. Net cash and investments now equal 40 percent of Samsung's market value, it added.               

The company is valued at 50 percent of its annual sales based on its enterprise value - equity market value less net cash and investments. Apple Inc, by comparison, is valued at 2.5 times its sales, the newspaper said.

Alcatel Looks to Hone Future Technologies in Japan

TOKYO¡XAlcatel-Lucent SA, one of the world¡¦s largest providers of telecommunications network equipment, is betting on Japan¡¦s surging appetite for the latest smartphone infrastructure to help it develop the technology the global market will need in the future.

Michel Combes, chief executive of the French-American company, this week opened a new research site in Tokyo that will work on development of software and cloud computing services for telecom networks. Those are the technologies carriers are embracing as they try to ease the load on overburdened hardware.

The facility is the first of its kind for Alcatel-Lucent, which has been focusing on potential growth areas as it accelerates a restructuring under Mr. Combes, who took over about a year and a half ago. The initial investment is small¡X¡§a few million euros,¡¨ according to Mr. Combes¡Xbut he described it as a vote of confidence in the future of the Japanese telecommunications business.

¡§It is obvious that Japan is extremely important to us,¡¨ Mr. Combes said. ¡§This country is still extremely fast in terms of innovation in the high-tech industry,¡¨ he added, citing the rapid embrace of high-speed Long-Term Evolution, or LTE, technology by the country¡¦s major mobile operators.

Yet the travails of the country¡¦s electronics industry, which has failed to produce a smartphone to compete with Apple Inc.¡¦s iPhone or Samsung Electronics Co.¡¦s Galaxy series, have also created an opening for foreign providers of the telecom network gear that is needed to carry the burgeoning volume of smartphone data traffic.

Japan imported ?619 billion ($5.7 billion) worth of network equipment in the financial year ended in March, up from Y603 billion a year earlier, according to the Communications and Information Network Association of Japan.

At the same time it also has two strong local players in NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd., which have long-standing relationships with Japanese telecom providers such as Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.

While foreign equipment providers like Huawei Technologies Co. of China and Ericsson of Sweden have made inroads in the Japanese market for wireless and fixed-line network access gear, ¡§Alcatel hasn't been a big player,¡¨ Mr. Combes said.

The company has had better luck with equipment like core routers, which manage the flow of data within networks. The company doesn¡¦t break out its sales in Japan, though Mr. Combes said they totaled ¡§several hundred million euros,¡¨ out of a companywide total of 14.4 billion euros in 2013.

Worldwide, sales of telecommunications equipment and software totaled $183 billion in the 2013 calendar year, up 3% from 2012, according to Infonetics, a research firm. It predicts that sales will total $1 trillion from 2014 through 2018. Infonetics says Alcatel-Lucent ranks fourth, behind Cisco, Huawei and Ericsson, in sales.

Mr. Combes says new technologies like those being studied at the Tokyo site will drive growth. At the research center, Alcatel-Lucent will invite its customers to jointly investigate ways to use networks more efficiently. Service providers are turning to the cloud as they grapple with ways to deal with the surge in traffic caused by the rise of online video and other bandwidth-hungry applications.

¡§Japan is at the heart of this new strategy in terms of innovation and growth,¡¨ Mr. Combes said.

S.Korea's Samsung Heavy to build oil tankers for sanctioned Russian firm - sources

MOSCOW, Oct 10 (Reuters) - South Korean shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries plans to build three Arctic tankers for Russian oil company Gazprom Neft, which has been targeted by Western sanctions, sources familiar with the deal said.

The sanctions imposed on Moscow over its role in the crisis in Ukraine have complicated Russian companies' oil exploration and production in deep water, Arctic offshore or shale projects, as they use Western technology.

Samsung Heavy said on Tuesday it had won a 472 billion Korean won ($444 million) order to build three tankers for an unnamed firm based in Europe and that it expected to complete the contract by April 2017.

The tankers will be bought by Gazprom Neft's Austria-based subsidiary Gazprom Neft Trading, one of the sources told Reuters.

"The purchaser is a trading subsidiary of Gazprom Neft based in Vienna," he said. Two other sources said that tankers were to be supplied for Gazprom Neft's subsidiary.

Although the help from the South Korean company would facilitate development of the oilfield, it indicates Russia is struggling to comply with an appeal by President Vladimir Putin to reduce reliance on imported technology.

Gazprom Neft, the oil-producing arm of Russian state gas company Gazprom, and Samsung Heavy Industries declined to comment.

The sources did not identify the future operator of the tankers or give details of the financing. The sanctions also restrict some Russian companies' access to Western finance.

Tankers are needed for supplies from Gazprom Neft's Novoportovskoye field, located in Russia's Arctic.

The Novoportovskoye field has recoverable reserves of more than 250 million tonnes of oil and gas condensate and 320 billion cubic meters of gas.

Gazprom Neft has said it plans annual light oil production at the field of 5-8 million tonnes by 2020 with a maximum possible output of 13 million tonnes per year.

WSJ.D Technology: IPhone 6 Demand Delays Larger iPad

Apple Inc. suppliers have pushed back plans to mass produce a larger-screen tablet to early next year, people familiar with the matter said, as they struggle to make enough new iPhones to meet strong demand.

Suppliers of the Cupertino, Calif., company had originally planned to produce the larger iPad in mass volume beginning in December, the people said.

"The top priority for the supply chain is to meet the overwhelming demand for the larger screen iPhones. The output of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus remains unsatisfactory," said a person at a supplier. "It would be challenging for display makers to split resources and spend a few months to ramp up production for a new larger screen iPad now."

Foxconn Technology Co., a major assembler of Apple's iPhones and iPads, is also facing the challenge of hiring enough factory workers to assemble the two new iPhones at its largest production site in Zhengzhou, in northern China. At the plant, more than 200,000 workers are dedicated to just making the new iPhones and key components such as metal casings. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is the world's largest contract manufacturer by revenue and has more than 1 million workers in China assembling electronics for companies including Apple, Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.

"Everyone is busy with the new iPhones, Foxconn's bread and butter. Chairman [Terry Gou] has also gone to the Zhengzhou site to monitor the production closely," said an official at Foxconn.

Apple said it sold more than 10 million of its new iPhones in its first weekend of availability. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus went on sale in 10 countries on Sept. 19. Apple has expanded to other countries in recent weeks and is expected to start sales of the handsets in China on Oct. 17. The company is expected to give an update on iPhone sales when it reports results for the quarter ended September, on Oct. 20.

Suppliers in Asia say Apple's larger tablet will likely have a 12.9-inch liquid-crystal-display screen with resolution that is similar to the current 9.7-inch iPad Air unveiled in October last year.

Apple said on Wednesday it was hosting a media event on Oct. 16. While the media invite didn't say what will be discussed, it is expected that Apple will unveil new iPads and iMacs. It remains unclear if the company will unveil plans for the larger iPad at the event and Apple declined to comment.

Apple's plans for a larger iPad come as the company's tablet business is showing signs of slowing. Unit sales of iPads have fallen for two straight quarters, while revenue from tablets has fallen on a year-to-year basis for four of the past five quarters.

It would be the first time Apple unveils a bigger screen iPad, following its move to launch bigger-screen iPhones last month to counter competition from rivals like Samsung Electronics Co. which popularized the big-screen mobile devices.

Apple introduced a smaller iPad -- the 7.9-inch iPad Mini -- in late 2012 as it tried to offer different sizes to compete in the tablet market.

Data from research firm IDC shows Apple's share of the global tablet market has slipped to 26.9% in the second quarter from 33% a year earlier. Samsung's share of the tablet market also fell to 17.2% from 18.8% as both companies have been facing rising competition from other Chinese vendors including Lenovo Group Ltd.

Google Phone to Intensify

Phablet Competition

Google Inc. this month expects to release its largest smartphone, intensifying competition in the fast-growing market for super-sized mobile devices known as phablets, according to three people familiar with the situation.

The new phone -- code-named Shamu after a SeaWorld theme park killer whale -- will have a 5.9-inch screen, a high-resolution display and be sold under the Nexus brand, two of the people said. Motorola Mobility, the phone maker that Google is selling to China's Lenovo Group Ltd., is manufacturing the phone, the people added. Google declined to comment.

The new phone will be larger than Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, which is 5.5 inches, and the Samsung Galaxy Note, the first successful phablet, which is 5.7 inches. Google plans to release a new version of its Android mobile-operating system at the same time. Tech blog The Information reported in July that Motorola was working on a Nexus phablet with Google.

Phablets, defined as smartphones with displays five inches or larger, were once ridiculed as unwieldy bricks for short-sighted, older consumers. But as phones have evolved from calling devices into computers for work tasks and watching videos, larger devices have caught on.

In 2011, phablets accounted for 1% of global smartphone shipments. This year, these big phones will make up 24% of the market, according to consultants Strategy Analytics. Stats like that forced Apple to drop its aversion to larger iPhones this year and now Google is responding.

"The phablet wars are in full effect and vendors need any possible edge they can get," said Neil Mawston, a mobile-industry analyst at Strategy Analytics. "Having a large phone will help Google."

Google has multiple goals with its Nexus phones and tablet computers. The company wants to sell devices, but it also uses the gadgets to help its software developers test updated versions of the Android operating system. Google also hopes other Android phone makers will adopt features of Nexus devices.

Until now, the largest Nexus phone is the Nexus 5, which measures five inches. Nexus tablets are larger, but don't include cellular connections.

"If Android doesn't have something at that size there will be a hole in their portfolio," said Ankit Jain, CEO and founder of mobile start-up Quettra and a former executive at Google Play, the Android app store. "Google doesn't want to make the same mistake that Apple made over the last few years by missing out on the demand for larger phones."

World News: Hong Kong: Social Apps Speed Up -- and Muddle -- Messages

HONG KONG -- A proliferation of social media tools is creating new opportunities -- and complications -- for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, helping them draw more activists to the streets while also making it tougher to keep them on message.

During unrest in places like Egypt, Iran and Tunisia in the past few years, social-media stalwarts Facebook and Twitter have played central roles, and in some cases were the only major social-media options available.

The expansion of social media tools, especially messaging apps, has given Hong Kong's protesters an edge in reaching supporters en masse. Smartphones are abundant in the relatively affluent city, which, unlike mainland China, has speedy, uncensored Internet.

But it has also added to the cacophony of noise and mixed messages that have fragmented Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement from the get-go, at times making it harder for protest leaders to manage their followers.

Hong Kong's protesters have relied heavily on WhatsApp, online message boards and encrypted messaging services that offer more security, such as Telegram Messenger. One inventor is offering an app designed to give protesters an early warning if police start to move on them.

With the number of social media users approaching one billion in Asia, according to research firm Webcertain Group -- nearly five times the number of North America -- the region has become a crucial testing ground for such new technologies, and a driving force behind the growth of messaging services.

Last Friday, protest leader Benny Tai called on followers to pull out of the gritty shopping district of Mong Kok, where antiprotester violence was breaking out. But some activists quickly turned to social-messaging services to rally friends, despite the call to stay away. Placid Cheung, 22, a finance worker, says he used a WhatsApp group to get people out to Mong Kok to support the students. The night proved to be a moral victory for the protesters, showing they could stay in the streets even when under attack.

"We don't pay a lot of attention" to protest leaders, he said. "Even if they say, 'don't go,' we would still go."

Protesters are tapping an array of social-media platforms to spread information, including some that were either not around or not as widely used a few years ago.

One advantage of services like WhatsApp, protesters say, is that users can exit groups and delete message histories if they are apprehended by police, making it harder to trace contacts and communications.

Other protesters are using Telegram, a Berlin-based messaging app launched last year. The company says it uses encryption services to keep its users' data private and secure, and runs the service as a noncommercial endeavor.

Then there are services such as FireChat, a free mobile-messaging app launched in March that allows users to communicate in the absence of Internet or cellular connections. It saw a surge of downloads when the Hong Kong protests first gained momentum and leaders worried about phone signals getting jammed.

Some protesters are using multiple services at once to reach the largest-possible audience, posting photos more or less at the same time on Facebook, Instagram and Weibo, a Chinese microblogging service.

Demonstrators are deploying "a complex landscape of communication tools" now, said Mart van de Ven, a Dutch data scientist who lives in a tenement near the Mong Kok protest site.

Mr. van de Ven said he has built an app for the protesters called Rally the Brollies, using a common British term for umbrellas -- a symbol of the pro-democracy movement after protesters used them to block pepper spray.

The app provides a digital alarm system intended to alert crowds if police move in on demonstrations. If that occurs, the alarm will be triggered through a Twitter hashtag sent out by student leaders. Those who registered will hear their smartphone alarms go off at full volume and get a text message.

"We're hoping it won't be necessary to use it," Mr. van de Ven said.

To be sure, protest leaders are also using more-traditional services such as Facebook. Scholarism, a group of younger students, has more than 300,000 followers on its Facebook page, and a handful of volunteers dedicated to keeping it updated with relevant news and messages from leaders.

Among them: William Liu, an 18-year-old freshman at Hong Kong Baptist University who works from midnight until 5 a.m., posting information from a Samsung laptop.

At midnight on Wednesday, Mr. Liu reposted articles from Apple Daily, the city's influential pro-democracy tabloid.

On a typical night, he refreshes the pages every 10 to 15 minutes, checking other pro-democracy outlets that carry heavy weight with protesters, including SocRec and Passion Times, news outlets run by activist media groups that help rally the movement's foot soldiers.

In the early days of the protests, when police clashed with demonstrators, leaders sent out urgent messages on Facebook calling on activists to join them in the streets.

A few days later, they counseled protesters to think of the long game. "Don't assume this will end too soon," Scholarism's 17-year-old leader, Joshua Wong, said on his Facebook page. Protesters should "take turns in holding on to the streets."

The Hong Kong Federation of Students, meanwhile, has 10 people who are loosely charged with keeping its Facebook page fresh.

But many rank-and-file protesters either don't follow the Facebook pages because they have other preferred options -- or they don't trust them.

"I don't rely much on social media like Facebook because sometimes people post things that are fake," said Maggie Chan, a volunteer at a supply station in one protest area. "Sometimes the pages can be hacked. So I mainly rely on what my friends tell me."

Protest leaders have tried to minimize such issues by using services like Telegram to talk among themselves. But they are less-effective for communicating to the public at large.

On Wednesday, Scholarism tried a different, decidedly old-school idea: It sent a team of 50 people armed with megaphones and leaflets to different districts across Hong Kong, hoping to "spread the message and mobilize people," said spokesman Oscar Lai.

"We want to explain to them why we are doing this Occupy thing and why we are blocking the traffic."

At the protest sites, some volunteers use yellow Motorola walkie-talkies donated by supporters, instead of smartphones. The walkie-talkies work great when too many people are using their smartphones, slowing Internet speeds, one volunteer said.

INTERVIEW-HTC CFO says company will not need to tap markets in 2015

478 words
8 October 2014
19:37

NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - HTC Corp will not need to tap the capital markets in 2015 or even beyond, the Taiwanese smartphone maker's chief financial officer told Reuters on Wednesday, citing its lack of debt, $1.7 billion in cash and the ability to fund itself.

"I don't think we need to worry about it at all," Chialin Chang said in an interview on the sidelines of the company's launch of a new smartphone and miniature connected camera. "We're not going to the capital markets for funding. We can self-fund ourselves very sufficiently."

HTC's phones have often struggled to translate positive early reviews into strong sales and the Taipei-based former contract manufacturer has found it difficult to build its own identity in an increasingly competitive space.

The company last week reported better-than-forecast third-quarter profit, but mainly thanks to cost cuts rather than improved sales.

Chang said the company now has a strong portfolio of phones at prices that will attract buyers in both developed markets and emerging ones.

"I think with a more robust portfolio we're going to be able to show that we can grow again," he said. "Hopefully people will feel in the next earnings call with the guidance, we can get the momentum back."

He also said the company has no interest in being acquired and that it can "best deliver shareholder value on our own, independently."

Like other, larger mobile phone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC is trying to diversify into other "connected" devices to find new growth outside an increasingly commoditized space, though he said phones remained the company's "key bread and butter."

Chang declined to comment on reports that Google Inc has selected HTC to make its upcoming 9-inch (23-cm) tablet or that the two companies could collaborate on a "smart watch" although he acknowledged that the company was working on other "smart devices."

The "Re" camera, which can be controlled remotely from an Android or Apple phone, represents one effort to branch out beyond phones. Given that the cylinder-shaped device is waterproof and is highly portable, it could be seen as a potential competitor to GoPro Inc cameras.

Chang said that was the wrong comparison since GoPro cameras are specifically aimed at "extreme" sports while the Re, which will sell for $199 in the United States, is aimed at everyday use.

He refused to be drawn on whether the Re camera, or the Desire EYE mobile phone, which features 13 megapixel front and rear cameras, would contribute more to the company's bottom line, or provide revenue targets for either product. (Reporting by Christian Plumb; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)

WASHINGTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Google Inc will fight patent holder Rockstar Consortium in a California court instead of a Texas court that lawyers consider more friendly toward plaintiffs.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Thursday ordered proceedings stayed in Texas over whether handsets made by Samsung Electronics, HTC Corp , AsuSTEK Computer, LG Electronics and ZTE Corp infringed on Rockstar's patents because they used Google's Android operating system.

Rockstar had filed the lawsuits in a Texas federal court, which is generally viewed as a friendly forum for patent owners. Google counter punched, filing a lawsuit in northern California in which it asked a judge to rule that devices using the Android platform had not infringed the patents cited by Rockstar.

The overlaps led the appeals court to rule that the issue should be decided first in California.

"It is clear that there was no need to proceed with the five Texas actions because the one California action may suffice," the court said. "The record strongly suggests that there will be substantial similarity involving the infringement and invalidity issues in all the suits."

WSJ.D Technology: HTC Takes New Look at Itself With Selfie Camera

TAIPEI -- While working on a product road map for smartphone maker HTC Corp. earlier this year, company Vice President Jerry Hsiao did some research.

"British women spend a month of their lives taking selfies," read an article from the British tabloid the Daily Mail that Mr. Hsiao selected for a PowerPoint slideshow highlighting his findings.

While Mr. Hsiao had included the article jokingly in a presentation this week about new products from the Taiwanese company, the observation holds true that people today are often endlessly fascinated with their own images refracted through high-tech gadgets. And long-suffering HTC is hoping that tendency will help it engineer a turnaround.

On Wednesday in New York, HTC, once the world's top smartphone maker by volume in 2011, launched a waterproof action camera and software for taking selfie photos, a departure from its usual emphasis on mobile-phone hardware. HTC also unveiled a selfie-focused smartphone to bolster the company's midprice Desire line.

It is a strategic change that the company hopes will help it reverse three years of falling sales. Last year, HTC fell out of the world's top 10 smartphone brands by shipments amid branding weakness and strong competition from Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea in the high-end market and Chinese rivals such as Xiaomi in the low-cost segment. This month, the company said its third-quarter revenue fell 11% to 41.86 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$1.37 billion), compared with NT$47 billion a year earlier, despite returning to a net profit largely on cost cuts.

Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said in an interview that the company hopes its new products will help it return to sales growth. HTC's sales have fallen year-over-year for the past 12 quarters.

HTC's $199 Re Camera is a slim tube-shaped camera that can be clipped to a backpack, mounted on a bicycle or taken underwater. It is the company's first major venture outside smartphones since its launch of a tablet computer three years ago, and will be sold on Amazon.com and through other retailers. The camera weighs about 2.5 ounces.

Chairwoman Cher Wang has blamed marketing weakness for HTC's decline. Its third marketing chief in two years left HTC this fall, after an advertising campaign with actor Robert Downey Jr. failed to stem the company's sales slide.

In an interview, Ms. Wang said HTC is looking to invest its marketing dollars more effectively. "The most important thing is to make the end-user love you," she said.

The smartphone maker released its Zoe slideshow app free for devices powered by Google Inc.'s Android software and Apple Inc.'s iOS. Its new selfie app, HTC Eye, offers voice-activated photo-taking and a video-chat feature that keeps a subject's face centered in the screen even if the person is walking around. The company plans to eventually make the selfie app available free of charge for non-HTC users.

HTC plans to offer the new smartphone, called Desire Eye, through AT&T Inc. later this month. Unsubsidized, the smartphone would cost between US$450 and US$500, Mr. Chang said. It comes with 13-megapixel cameras on both the front and rear and has a 5.2-inch screen.

A number of competitors await HTC in the selfie-smartphone niche. Samsung, Sony Corp. of Japan and others have also rolled out smartphones with features intended to make it easier to take and edit selfie photos.

With the Re camera, HTC will have to vie against other action-camera makers, such as GoPro Inc. of San Mateo, Calif.

Nobel Prize Is Boost For Japanese Firms

TOKYO -- The award of the Nobel Prize in physics to three scientists born in Japan stands to boost the morale of the country's beleaguered electronics industry, showing how obscure Japanese companies that specialize in parts and materials can still retain a technological edge.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on Tuesday honored the researchers for inventing the blue light-emitting diode, which has made possible lighting that is more energy-efficient than incandescent bulbs. The blue diode, which first appeared in 1992, was needed to produce white light by combining it with red and green diodes, which already existed.

One of the Nobel winners, Shuji Nakamura, was working at a Japanese maker of lighting equipment, Nichia Corp., when the breakthrough occurred. The other two, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano, helped Japanese parts supplier Toyoda Gosei Co. develop LED technology.

Nichia, which Dr. Nakamura left in 1999 in a dispute over compensation for the research, is the world's largest maker of LEDs, with $2.09 billion in sales last year, according to research firm IHS.

But Nichia's share of the $16 billion LED market was 13% last year, down from 21% in 2005, according to IHS. And while Japan is home to three of the 10 largest suppliers, Nichia, Toyoda Gosei and Stanley Electric Co., the country's share of the market is little more than 20%.

"Japanese companies are losing share because newcomers keep joining the market," said IHS analyst Lee Kun Soo. The rivals include Taiwan's Everlight Electronics Co., U.S.-based Cree Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Seoul Semiconductor Co. of South Korea, and several Chinese companies. "Japanese companies are going for the higher end, B-to-B applications," Mr. Lee said.

LEDs can be used for simple household lamps or outdoor lighting, where they are slowly replacing incandescent bulbs. LEDs accounted for 15% of sales of household light sources last year, up from 4% in 2009, according to research firm Euromonitor. "The publicity generated by this award is likely to boost consumer interest in LED lamps," Euromonitor said. Consumer acceptance has been faster in Asia and continental Europe than in the U.S. and the U.K., the firm said.

Japanese companies have retained an edge in LEDs' most lucrative applications, such as automotive headlights and backlights for smartphone screens.

Nichia says it has 23% of the market for high-brightness LEDs, which are used for smartphones and other high-tech purposes.

Apple Inc.'s website lists Nichia as a supplier. The U.S. company didn't respond to a request for comment, but analysts have said the Japanese company makes LEDs that are used in Apple's iPhones. Closely held Nichia, which is based in remote Tokushima prefecture on the island of Shikoku, declined to identify its clients.

While some Japanese electronics firms, such as Panasonic Corp., make consumer LED lighting, Nichia sells only to other businesses. As a result, it may benefit less from the Nobel buzz than the makers of consumer LED products. Japan's Sony Corp. three weeks ago forecast a loss of $2.15 billion for the fiscal year through March, much more than it had previously predicted.

In a sign of the shrinking presence of the Japanese electronics industry, the nation's biggest consumer technology trade show, now under way outside Tokyo, has drawn the smallest number of exhibitors since the show's inception in 2000.

Finally, a $100 Tablet Worth Buying; Battery Life, Speed Make Amazon¡¦s Fire HD 6 the Best Deal Among Low-Price Competitors

By Geoffrey A. Fowler 
1,397 words
8 October 2014

The Wall Street Journal Online

Here¡¦s a surprise: You can now buy a tablet for $100. Here¡¦s a bigger surprise: It won¡¦t necessarily be terrible.

Cheap Android tablets have been on the market for a while, but most were barely worth turning into cat toys. Now, four years after the first iPad, Amazon¡¦s $99 Fire HD 6 has brought a new baseline of quality to tablets that are inexpensive enough to be essentially disposable.

This means two things: First, you don¡¦t have to lay out big bucks for an iPad or Galaxy Tab for everyone in your family. Second, your cheap tablets aren¡¦t necessarily going to last as long, and you must be better prepared for what to do with them when they die.

Amazon¡¦s new tablet caught my attention because it doesn¡¦t skimp on core specs. It is as speedy as the top of the line from 2012, which is to say decent. And its 6-inch screen is sufficiently bright and visible from most angles. (A 7-inch version costs $139.) Even the battery holds up to more than 11? hours of video playback.

So I put it to the test, alongside two other Android tablets from big brands, Acer¡¦s Iconia One 7 and Asus¡¦ MeMO Pad 7 (whose $100 price has since risen to $120). I also threw an ultracheap tablet in the mix, the $55 Tablet Express Dragon Touch 7, which has garnered thousands of rather divided customer reviews online.

All four of these tablets represent compromise. If you¡¦re a no-compromises kind of person, take a look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab S or tune in Oct. 16 when Apple is expected to unveil new iPads which will surely make last year¡¦s models feel ancient. But thanks to the persistent drumbeat of manufacturing efficiency, it¡¦s now possible to get 80% of the functionality of a full-featured tablet for 30% of the price.

Amazon¡¦s Fire makes a fine children¡¦s playtime machine, pocket-size video player, Web browser or e-book reader, if you don¡¦t mind that Amazon subsidizes the $99 version with ads on the tablet¡¦s lock screen. And if you don¡¦t want to be locked into Amazon¡¦s store and Prime service, Acer¡¦s Iconia One is a passable alternative, albeit one with a weaker battery and camera.

What¡¦s a $100 Tablet Good For?

I tested my lineup of tablets with a gantlet of everyday tasks.

For many of us, tablets are foremost portable TVs for watching Netflix or baby sitting little ones with cartoons. Even a $55 tablet can play or stream video today. For $100, Amazon¡¦s Fire does entertainment almost as well as Apple, with its own version of Android tailored to its large content store.

The Fire¡¦s 6-inch screen, while an inch smaller than both the Acer and Asus, packs enough bright, saturated pixels to make most videos look OK. Only by holding it next to a pricier tablet can you see where Amazon cut corners. Though high-def, the screen isn¡¦t the ¡§full HD¡¨ found on TVs and higher-end tablets. And, lacking the latest display advancements, it also suffers from glare.

Thankfully, Amazon didn¡¦t skimp on battery life. The Fire lasted nearly half a day when I set it playing video with brightness at 50%, a performance only Asus could come close to matching. (Acer¡¦s Iconia One ran out of juice after about six hours; the poor Dragon Touch ran out in under four hours.)

Still, the Fire¡¦s battery performance fell by half when I set brightness to max, which you¡¦d want if you¡¦re using it near a window. I wish the Fire had an auto brightness setting.

E-books and websites download fine on the Fire, though Amazon did use a slower Wi-Fi chip on the HD line than on its premium HDX tablets. That $80 step up also has a higher-resolution screen that makes type appear smoother.

The biggest compromise is how it feels in your hands. The Fire is small enough to fit in a roomy pocket or bag, but when I sit back to read, it feels a little chunky. It weighs about as much as an iPad Mini, and less than a full can of Coke. None of Amazon¡¦s bargain competitors were significantly slimmer.

All cheap tablets have front and rear cameras these days. But don¡¦t buy a $100 tablet to take pictures. Actually, don¡¦t buy any tablet to take pictures¡Xyou look silly. If you insist, here¡¦s what you¡¦ll get from the Fire: Shots that look like they came from your 2009 smartphone. Still, it was the leader of the $100 pack.

These tablets also can run most popular Android games. I could knock out the trickiest swine in ¡§Angry Birds,¡¨ and crash into lots of things with ¡§Need for Speed Most Wanted.¡¨

The zippiest performance came from the Fire HD 6, which clocks in at about the same speed as a 2012 Samsung Galaxy Note II phablet. Still, don¡¦t buy the Fire for a serious gamer: More graphics-rich games tend to come first¡Xor only¡Xto Apple devices. Amazon doesn¡¦t even offer some popular Android games found in Google¡¦s Play store, such as ¡§Madden NFL Mobile.¡¨

The ultimate test¡Xthe tablet pentathlon¡Xis Skyping with loved ones. It requires fast wireless, a zippy processor, decent cameras and speakers and a screen visible from all angles. While the Fire¡¦s front-facing camera is very low resolution, it did a fine job balancing the shot in a backlit situation. Its speaker is a little on the quiet side, but sounded natural.

What¡¦s most impressive about Amazon and Acer for video chats is that you and the rest of the family can see the screen at the same time from different positions. The Asus and Dragon Touch, on the other hand, have some of the worst viewing angle problems I¡¦ve seen in years.

None of the screens were great for getting work done. You can answer work email on a $100 tablet, but you wouldn¡¦t want to use apps that require any sort of precision. Switching between running apps is possible on these tablets, but so slow it will make you sad.

Speaking of apps, you¡¦ll find generic office suites but no official Microsoft Office on Android tablets. Amazon doesn¡¦t even have access to Google¡¦s free productivity apps, a possible deal-breaker for some.

How Long Will a $100 Tablet Last?

Before buying a $100 tablet you¡¦re going to have ask the tough questions of how long you expect it to be in service¡Xand what you¡¦ll do when it craps out.

You can¡¦t easily replace the batteries on any of these tablets (same as with the iPad). And processors falter as software gets more sophisticated. Amazon¡¦s latest system software doesn¡¦t even support tablets the company made three years ago. I¡¦d wager this Fire will do fine for about 18 months.

Companies haven¡¦t always made it easy to properly get rid of electronics, but that¡¦s starting to change. For $50 more, Amazon sells a Kids Edition of this tablet with a rugged case and a guarantee from Amazon that if it gets broken the company will take it back and send you a new one.

Amazon, Acer and Asus have little-advertised free programs that take back tablets via mail, wipe your personal data, then refurbish or recycle them. Best Buy takes back many devices in person, and 1800recycling.com can help you find others.

A recent Best Buy-commissioned survey found just 39% of people say they recycle their electronics. If tablets are designed to become obsolete sooner rather than later, companies need to build them to be recycled and make it easier for us to do our part.

Corrections & Amplifications

A recent Best Buy-commissioned survey found 39% of people say they recycle their electronics. A previous version of this column incorrectly identified Electronic Recyclers International as having conducted the survey. (Oct. 7, 2014)

* Sees strong demand from low-end Chinese smartphone makers

* On track for record sales in current financial year

By Sophie Knight and Yoshiyasu Shida

CHIBA, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd's chief executive said rising demand for electronic components from Chinese smartphone makers could buffer any future fall in sales from two of its largest customers, known to be Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd .

For the moment, the Japanese firm is not worried about depending on those two companies as they command half the smartphone market, Chief Executive Tsuneo Murata told Reuters in an interview without identifying them by name on Tuesday at CEATEC, one of Japan's biggest electronics trade shows.

"There's nothing bad about relying on something strong," Murata said.

"If it goes bad maybe that would be a problem. But if you look at a pie chart of smartphone makers, we cover basically all of it. Even if the slices of that pie chart change it wouldn't affect us much."

Murata's confidence is unusual among Apple suppliers, many of whom are moving to reduce their reliance on the Californian technology company after being hurt by the volatility of its product cycle or by the tightness of its margins.

Murata's mainstay products are ceramic capacitors, tiny parts that control the flow of electricity in electronic devices from game consoles to car engine controls. The majority are used in smartphones, which account for around 40 percent of Murata's overall sales.

Because of their size and the fact that they do not need to be custom-designed for different phone models like display panels, Murata can more flexibly make up for a shortfall in orders from a big customer like Apple than companies that make niche or custom-made parts.

Other Japanese parts makers such as Sharp Corp are seeking to lower their dependence on Apple while sapphire manufacturer GT Advanced Technologies Inc filed for bankruptcy on Monday after signing an exclusive contract with Apple to supply sapphire glass from a new factory.

Murata said that his company's performance for the three months to Sept. 31 was in line with expectations and that sales to China had been strong, although lower than initially expected after the largest carrier there, China Mobile Ltd, pulled back from a recommendation for higher handset specifications that had increased demand for Murata's components.

However, Murata remains bullish about the company's reliance on smartphones for profit even as other Japanese makers of high-end parts fret about slowing demand for pricier phones and expanding sales of low-end phones.

"We are not selling cheaply to Chinese makers... There is an ongoing shift from 3G phones to 4G and that is creating additional demand for our parts. So an increase in low-end Chinese smartphones is anything but a minus for us - it's a plus."

Murata is still on track for record sales for a second straight year after logging 846.7 billion yen ($7.8 billion) in revenue for the year ended March 31. It is guiding for 34.1 billion yen in operating profit for the quarter from July to September. (1 US dollar = 108.5600 Japanese yen)

Mazda, Doritos, Whole Foods Line Up to Promote 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1'

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - After two successful films, Lionsgate's "Hunger Games" franchise is attracting an unexpected group of promotional partners for its next installment.

Mazda, Doritos and Whole Foods Market have joined Samsung to launch campaigns around "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," which will fly into theaters in Nov. 21.

Samsung already has kicked off its campaign, having provided fans the chance to watch the first teaser trailer for the film at San Diego Comic-Con, showcasing the footage on its new tablet, of course. Company also built a lavish experience to bring the film to life by displaying character posters, costumes, President Snow's white chair (from the film) and pastries from Peeta's Bakery.

While none of the brand partners will be featured in the new movie - no, District 13's citizens won't be munching on Doritos - their tie-ins will make it seem as if they're part of "The Hunger Games" world.

For example, Mazda will enable fans to submit designs for a hovercraft via Tumblr, with each one triggering a donation to one of the company's charitable partners. The automaker is the film's official automobile sponsor of the U.S. premiere.

Mazda also will team up with Doritos to sponsor the film's Our Leader the Mockingjay app, available through OurLeaderTheMockingjay.Co.In, the Apple and Android app stores.

Naturally, "Mockingjay - Part 1" characters and film imagery will appear on Doritos bags beginning this month. When scanned with mobile devices, the packaging will unlock exclusive content through the film's app. Company's also launched microsite Unlock District 13, that is running a sweepstakes.

Similarly, Mazda will offer up exclusive content for the movie when a Mazda logo is scanned from a brochure, print ad or on Mazda's U.S. website using the app.

Also enlisting its charity programs around "Mockingjay - Part 1" is Whole Foods.

The grocery chain will donate $1 to its Whole Planet Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to alleviating global poverty, each time its in-house Courage of One juice brand is purchased.

Effort is a continuation of the charity programs Lionsgate launched around the "The Hunger Games" franchise's previous films.

"We are proud of our association with not-for-profit organizations like Whole Planet Foundation and to continue to build on our relationships with 'The Hunger Games' franchise partners Feeding America and World Food Programme," said Tim Palen, Lionsgate's chief marketing officer.

Francis Lawrence returns to direct the series' third film, starring Jennifer Lawrence, from a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong.

The novel on which the film is based is the third in a trilogy written by Suzanne Collins, with over 65 million copies in print in the U.S. alone.

The first "Hunger Games: Catching Fire" had CoverGirl and Subway as partners.

SEOUL, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Already the world's biggest duty-free market, South Korea said on Wednesday it will issue more licences for downtown duty-free shops, doubling down on a strategy that has helped it outstrip  regional rivals seeking to reel in shopaholic Chinese tourists.               

Seoul-based Lotte Duty Free and Hotel Shilla, part of the Samsung Group, have been adept at luring mainland China shoppers by promoting in-vogue South Korean culture - known as the "Korean wave" - and products such as cosmetics and appliances. The tactic has helped turn the pair into the world's fourth- and eighth-largest duty free retailers by sales respectively.               

Thanks to Chinese tourists' appetite for the luxury goods and, in particular, Korean items, South Korea overtook Britain in 2010 to become the world's largest duty-free market. In 2012, the last year for which full sales numbers are available globally, it raked in $5.86 billion in duty-free sales, or 11 percent of the global market, according to the Korea Customs Service.               

"Lotte and Shilla's particular strength lies in their understanding of the North Asia traveller, the Koreans naturally but more particularly the Chinese and the Japanese," said Martin Moodie, an industry expert and chairman of the Moodie Report.               

Korean cosmetics, he said, are "arguably the hottest category in travel retail worldwide".               

South Korea is enjoying a wave of popularity with Chinese tourists, with visitor numbers on track to hit 6 million this year, up 39 percent from the 4.32 million arrivals in 2013, according to the Korea Tourism Organisation.                              

'I CAME TO SHOP'               

South Korea is hardly alone in looking to attract free-spending Chinese visitors. This month, Japan extended its list of items that can be sold duty-free, including food, medicines and cosmetics.               

Driven by government tourism promotions of "Cool Japan" culture and a weaker yen, the number of travellers to Japan has doubled in the past decade to top 10 million for the first time last year. Japan wants to double that again to 20 million by 2020, the year of the Tokyo Olympics.               

In downtown Seoul on Wednesday, Wei Ci, a 24-year-old Beijing resident, scanned a row of local skincare products at the Dongwha Duty-Free Store. "I came to Korea mainly to shop," she said, explaining she planned to spend the day making the rounds of the capital's duty-free shops.               

Lotte Duty Free, a unit of Lotte Shopping, and Shilla have specialised in downtown duty-free shops in South Korea's bustling cities. Unlike traditional airport duty-free shops, they must generate their own tourist traffic.               

To do that, they engage in marketing that is more aggressive than the industry standard, staging Korean music - K-pop - concerts and fan meetings with actors and using Chinese social media such as the Weibo microblogging service. Both are now pursuing expansion overseas.               

Of South Korea's current 42 duty-free shops - Lotte has 8 Shilla 6 - some 17 are in city locations, including two on the holiday hotspot island of Jeju. At these locations, as in airport shops, duty-free shoppers must show a boarding pass for an upcoming flight.               

South Korea government officials didn't specify on Wednesday how many new licences may be added. The matter needs to be discussed with regional authorities to gauge demand, they said.

WSJ.D Technology: Samsung Braces for Cost Cuts as Profit Ebbs --- After Fourth Consecutive Decline in Quarterly Operating Earnings, Smartphone Maker Faces Big Transition

SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. is bracing for more cost cuts and a potential management change later this year as it struggles to halt a sharp slide in profit.

The world's biggest smartphone maker by shipments said on Tuesday its third-quarter operating profit likely fell as much as 62% from a year earlier, hit by weak smartphone sales. This would mark its fourth consecutive decline in operating profit and its steepest year-over-year decline in the past five years.

Samsung, South Korea's biggest company by market capitalization, is facing stiff competition from Chinese handset makers that are aggressively introducing less-costly phones. In the high-end smartphone market, it is battling Apple Inc., which last month unveiled new iPhones with bigger screens that are popular with consumers.

Samsung's weak guidance further highlighted the company's overdependence on the mobile division to generate earnings growth, said analysts.

"Samsung's memory-chip business is now the only division that is doing well," said C.W. Chung, an analyst with Nomura in Seoul. "Until the company's mobile unit is able to recover, continued strength in the company's chip business will be key."

Critics said Samsung is struggling to figure out its growth strategy beyond its recent focus on smartphones, software and wearable devices.

Samsung appeared to be shifting its emphasis to the semiconductor business when it unveiled an aggressive $14.7 billion investment plan on Monday to build a chip-manufacturing plant in South Korea. Shares of rival chip makers slumped after the move because of concerns about a potential supply glut.

Uncertainties about its future also loom as Samsung grapples with the transition of management power to a new generation. Chairman Lee Kun-hee remains in a hospital after a heart attack in May. While Samsung said Mr. Lee's health is improving, critics said the company apparently lacks the visionary leadership it needs to steer it into new growth areas, especially at a challenging time.

In recent months, Samsung affiliates have been carrying out a series of financial transactions that would help heir-apparent and Mr. Lee's only son, Jay Y. Lee, assume control of the company from his father. The younger Mr. Lee, a vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, remains the biggest shareholder of the de facto holding company of Samsung Group, South Korea's biggest conglomerate.

"There needs to be a smooth transition, but we'll have to wait and see if his son can play a similar role," said Mr. Chung of Nomura.

Samsung's mobile business -- which generates more than 60% of its operating profit -- earlier this year forced hundreds of senior managers to take a 25% cut in their first-half bonuses, according to people familiar with the matter. Now, executives and senior managers are bracing for more cost cuts, a person familiar with the situation recently said. Details of any new cost cuts couldn't be immediately learned. In a surprise move last month, Samsung quietly shifted about 500 software engineers from its mobile unit to other parts of the company.

Expectations for the third quarter had already been low because sales of Samsung's flagship device, Galaxy S5, have been weaker than forecast, analysts said, and the company began to roll out its new smartphone-tablet hybrid, the Galaxy Note 4, only late last month. Even though Samsung has unveiled a number of mobile devices in the quarter, including a smartphone with a curved edge, analysts said the products aren't resonating with consumers.

Samsung said in a written statement that while smartphone shipments increased in the quarter, its operating margin was weighed down by hefty marketing costs and falling average selling prices.

As a result, the company said its third-quarter operating profit likely fell 58% to 62% from a year earlier to between 3.9 trillion won and 4.3 trillion won (or $3.6 billion and $4 billion), missing analysts' expectations of 4.3 trillion won. A year earlier, Samsung reported an operating profit of 10.2 trillion won. It estimated revenue of 46 trillion won to 48 trillion won in the latest period, below the 59.1 trillion won reported a year earlier.

Samsung also sounded a cautious note about the fourth quarter, saying the outlook remains uncertain.

With the mobile unit widely expected to drag down profit in the next few quarters, Samsung's memory-chip business is expected to cushion the blow thanks to tight global supply, analysts said. Chip profits could exceed those from mobile phones later this year, rising to at least 50% of overall operating profit from about 20% last year, some analysts predict. Samsung's semiconductor profit last topped mobile profit in the second quarter of 2011.

Still, Samsung faces strong competition in the microprocessor sector, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. winning orders for chips used in Apple's iPhones. Samsung's microprocessor business has been mired in losses, according to analysts' estimates. The company didn't disclose divisional figures in its guidance Tuesday.

Doh Hyun-woo, an analyst with Mirae Asset Securities in Seoul, said he expects Samsung's operating profit from its chip business to rise 34% to 11.5 trillion won in 2015, from an estimated 8.6 trillion won this year. He forecast mobile operating profit to fall 34% to 9.7 trillion won next year from an estimated 14.8 trillion won in 2014.

Samsung is slated to release final third-quarter earnings results later this month.

Asian-Pacific Stocks
Hong Kong Stocks Rise; Tokyo Falls

Hong Kong shares rose as the government and student protesters continued to seek a format for talks, while Japanese shares slid amid a weaker dollar.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.5% to 23422.52, advancing for a third consecutive session.

Brokerage IG said working conditions in Hong Kong are returning to normal, but the cost of the protests won't be known until trade-balance numbers and other activity gauges are released in early November.

Banks and property developers with strong exposure to the territory were mixed.

Chong Hing Bank jumped 4.5%, Standard Chartered climbed 2.4%, and Hang Seng Bank rose 1.4%, while developer New World Development improved by 1.3% and Cheung Kong (Holdings) moved up 1.1%.

However, Sino-British banking giant HSBC Holdings dipped 0.1%, and Henderson Land Development edged down 0.2%.

Most Hong Kong retailers rebounded further, with jeweler Luk Fook Holdings International advancing 2.5%, rival Chow Sang Sang Holdings International rising 0.5%, and clothing retailer I.T Ltd. adding 0.8%.

In Japan, the Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.7% to 15783.83 as the dollar weakened. Among exporters, industrial robot maker Fanuc slipped 1.1%, air-conditioner maker Daikin Industries fell 1.9% and auto maker Fuji Heavy Industries lost 1.4%.

The Bank of Japan said it would maintain its position on monetary policy, as expected.

Elsewhere, Korea's Kospi closed up 0.2% at 1972.91.

Samsung Electronics rose as much as 3% in early trading in Seoul after the company forecast that its third-quarter operating profit more than halved from a year earlier. Samsung's shares had already been battered on expectations weak smartphone sales would hit profit. The shares closed up 1%.

In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.2% to 5284.20.

Rio Tinto was up 4.3% in Sydney, after the company said it rejected a takeover proposal by Glencore because it wasn't in the best interest of shareholders. The possible takeover inspired a rally in large mining stocks. BHP Billiton rose 1.7% and Fortescue Metals Group added 4.2%.

That wasn't enough, however, to outweigh broad-based declines among banks and retailers.

India's Sensex was down 1.1% at 26271.97.

Apple Takes Bite of Samsung

Samsung Electronics has gone from smartphone model to basket case. There could be worse to come.

Samsung said Tuesday its third-quarter operating profit likely fell 58% to 62% from a year earlier, which was even worse than already low analyst expectations. It was the fourth quarter in a row of declining operating profit. A detailed breakdown won't be available until Samsung releases full results, but the problem is clearly in the mobile division. Samsung said total smartphone shipments "increased marginally" in the period, but margins declined due to lower selling prices and higher marketing expenses.

Samsung's smartphone business is facing intense competitive pressure at the low end from Chinese handset makers, and at the high end from the iPhone.

With the iPhone 6, Apple essentially wiped out Samsung's distinguishing feature: a big screen size. And with the jumbo iPhone 6 Plus, Apple has now entered into the "phablet" segment that Samsung pioneered.

The third quarter included just 12 days of iPhone 6 sales. Expect the impact on Samsung in the fourth quarter to be much bigger. Nomura analyst C.W. Chung says Samsung's past few years of strong profitability in mobile devices were an anomaly, driven by Apple's premium pricing, which supported margins across the sector.

But without essential differentiators like Apple's, such as design cachet and a software ecosystem, Samsung is headed toward becoming a maker of commoditized hardware.

Mr. Chung sees operating margins for handsets and tablets declining to 11% in 2016 from 21% in 2013.

A bright spot for Samsung is its components business, including memory and logic chips as well as displays. Analysts expect components to account for more than 40% of operating profits next year, compared with around 30% this year. Samsung underscored its focus on this area on Monday, when it announced plans to invest $14.7 billion building a new chip plant in South Korea.

Components are less sexy than smartphones, but they can still make money, especially when you are the technology and scale leader, as Samsung is in memory chips, says Mark Newman of Bernstein Research. But Samsung's smartphone problems could blow back on the component business as well. The company's smartphones are the biggest customers for its application processor chips and cutting-edge organic light emitting diode displays.

Ultimately, focusing more on components will only intensify the trend toward becoming a commoditized hardware maker. For that, investors have plenty of other choices.

Hilton Tosses the Waldorf

To Chinese Insurer Anbang

The Chinese insurer spending eye-popping sums on the Waldorf-Astoria should remember that luxury-hotel stays often come with hidden charges.

Hilton Worldwide Holdings struck a deal Monday to sell Manhattan's block-sized Waldorf-Astoria to Anbang Insurance Group, little known outside China, for $1.95 billion. It is a mega transaction for a famous hotel and comes after a string of Chinese purchases of U.S. and European real estate.

The symbolism of a Chinese company buying a New York landmark brings to mind memories of Mitsubishi Estate's 1989 purchase of Rockefeller Center. That deal, which ended up in bankruptcy court, came to symbolize the folly of Japanese overspending on U.S. assets. It is too easy to simply say history will repeat. But at such a price, Anbang will need a developer's acumen to make the deal succeed.

The grand though aged Waldorf needs a renovation, a task that will add substantially to Anbang's sticker price. Such an investment could be paid back with higher room rates or proceeds for the sale of rooms converted to condominiums. That Hilton itself preferred to skip the risk is a sign of the task ahead.

Still, an agreement for Hilton to manage the flagship property for another century ensures Anbang has expertise to guide it in the effort. The sale continues Hilton's exit from the capital-intensive business of owning real estate and its push to concentrate on sweeping up management and franchise fees from property owners.

Insurance companies have tended to invest in real estate as a diversification from bonds. With steady rental income and predictable costs, property can serve those ends. The problem is that hotels are most susceptible to economic downturns, with leases essentially running one night, compared with a decade in an office building filled with credit-rated tenants.

Anbang is paying $1.4 million per room, a substantial sum but less than the per-room price for recent transactions for the nearby Plaza Hotel and Carlyle Hotel. The deal is about 33 times the Waldorf's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year through June. That compares with 15 times Hilton's overall Ebitda and a similar multiple for hotel property owner Host Hotels Corp. A premium is surely deserved for the impeccably located Waldorf. But to make it work, Anbang's use of debt will be critical.

Glencore's Approach Lacks Iron

If timing is everything in trading, Glencore has misfired with its July approach to Rio Tinto.

True, Rio's confirmation that the trader-cum-miner expressed interest in a merger actually highlights the Anglo-Australian miner's strategic quandary. Rio has focused on cutting costs and improving free cash flow. It has pledged to raise returns to shareholders next year.

It isn't clear what happens next. Rio, which already has rejected pursuing conversations with Glencore, isn't diversified: 80% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization come from iron ore, a commodity whose price is under serious pressure.

Even so, absent a chunky premium, there isn't much right now to bring Rio to the negotiating table.

The iron-ore price is down 40% this year, but the jury is still out on whether the strategy of the largest iron-ore miners is based on logic or, as Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg claims, on lunacy. Rio, BHP Billiton and Vale have all expanded their output, adding tons into an oversupplied market. Boosting production to force higher-cost rivals out of the market, though, could mean the market returns to an effective oligopoly.

Meanwhile, Rio's future could be as a cash cow, shoveling dirt at its low-cost iron-ore pits. Thanks partly to Rio's expansion of its Pilbara operations in Western Australia, its cash flows should continue growing through iron ore's weakness. Mr. Glasenberg may scoff but brownfield iron-ore growth also offers enviable returns: Bank of America Merrill Lynch put the return on capital employed for BHP Billiton's latest expansion at 100%, even before the miner reduced the costs involved.

The risk is that iron ore crashes, vindicating Mr. Glasenberg's view of the world, and Rio, stymied by its lack of diversification, shelves plans to buy back shares. In that case, Glencore would likely find shareholders receptive.

If Glencore returns, Rio's board should insist on a proper takeover premium. Glencore may have the diversified portfolio and the vaunted management team, but Rio has the stronger balance sheet, the higher-quality resource base and the more profitable assets.

That would leave Glencore to make the case for the value of a combination. Running Rio Tinto's iron ore through Glencore's marketing machine could be worth $1 to $2 per metric ton, reckons Citi. But that could be tougher in an oversupplied market. Moreover, digging and shipping 300 million tons of dirt, compared with Glencore's iron-ore trading of perhaps 40 million tons, may not lend itself to clever arbitrage as well as other commodities.

Yes, there would be some cost savings. But Rio already has chopped nearly $4 billion in costs. The synergies from putting together Glencore and Rio's coal operations in Australia's Hunter Valley could be found through a joint venture, without creating a $160 billion company and paying a control premium.

Putting a price on Rio would allow Glencore to force the issue. Otherwise, it is the iron-ore market that will determine if and when this deal's time will come.

Apple Takes a Bite From Samsung

Samsung Electronics has gone from smartphone model to basket case. There could be worse to come.

Samsung said Tuesday its third-quarter operating profit likely fell 58% to 62% from a year earlier, which was even worse than already low analyst expectations. It was the fourth quarter in a row of declining operating profit. A detailed breakdown won¡¦t be available until Samsung releases full results, but the problem is clearly in the mobile division. Samsung said total smartphone shipments ¡§increased marginally¡¨ in the period, but margins declined due to lower selling prices and higher marketing expenses.

Samsung¡¦s smartphone business is facing intense competitive pressure at the low-end from Chinese handset makers, and at the high-end from the iPhone. With the iPhone 6, Apple essentially wiped out Samsung¡¦s distinguishing feature: a big screen size. And with the jumbo iPhone 6 Plus, Apple has now entered into the ¡§phablet¡¨ segment that Samsung pioneered.

The third quarter included just 12 days of iPhone 6 sales. Expect the impact on Samsung in the fourth quarter to be much bigger. Nomura analyst C.W. Chung says Samsung¡¦s past few years of strong profitability in mobile devices were an anomaly, driven by Apple¡¦s premium pricing, which supported margins across the sector.

But without essential differentiators like Apple¡¦s, such as design cachet and a software ecosystem, Samsung is headed toward becoming a maker of commoditized hardware. Mr. Chung sees operating margins for handsets and tablets declining to 11% in 2016 from 21% in 2013.

A bright spot for Samsung is its components business, including memory and logic chips as well as displays. Analysts expect components to account for more than 40% of operating profits next year, compared with around 30% this year. Samsung underscored its focus on this area on Monday, when it announced plans to invest $14.7 billion building a new chip plant in South Korea.

Components are less sexy than smartphones, but they can still make money, especially when you are the technology and scale leader, as Samsung is in memory chips, says Mark Newman of Bernstein Research. But Samsung¡¦s smartphone problems could blow back on the component business as well. The company¡¦s smartphones are the biggest customers for its application processor chips and cutting-edge organic light emitting diode displays.

Ultimately, focusing more on components will only intensify the trend toward becoming a commoditized hardware maker. For that, investors have plenty of other choices.

Flash-storage player SolidFire raises $82 million

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - SolidFire, a flash-storage company, said it has raised $82 million in new funding, a sign of the increasing appeal of technology that helps companies store data in new ways.

The cash will help the Boulder, Colorado-based company expand, with profitability expected in the next "couple of years," Chief Executive Dave Wright said in an interview.

SolidFire and rivals such as Pure Storage are taking on companies such as EMC and NetApp that built their reputations on disk-based storage. The newcomers rely on "flash," or chip-based storage, which generally works faster than older technologies.

Flash helps products integrate well with aspects of the cloud, in which data is accessed via the Internet rather than from on-site hardware. Companies are racing to adopt cloud technology because of its flexibility and lower costs compared with older methods.

"Our ability to leverage flash at cloud scale, that ultimately is what sets us up for long-term success," Wright said.

Greenspring Associates, an Owings Mill, Maryland-based fund, led the financing round with Silicon Valley Bank and an unnamed sovereign wealth fund. Existing investors NEA, Novak Biddle, Samsung Ventures and Valhalla Partners participated.

Earlier this year, competitor Pure Storage raised $225 million. Flash-based Nimble Storage and Violin Memory held initial public offerings last year.

Samsung, Rio Tinto Shares Rise as Asian Markets Close Mixed

Samsung Electronics Co. and Rio Tinto PLC were two of the main gainers among Asian stocks on Tuesday as markets closed mixed, with Hong Kong¡¦s Hang Seng Index up 0.5% as the government and student protesters continued to seek a format for talks.

Samsung¡¦s shares rose as much as 3% in early trading in Seoul after the company forecast that its third-quarter operating profit more than halved from a year earlier. Samsung¡¦s shares had already been battered on expectations weak smartphone sales would hit profit. The shares closed up 1.0%.

¡§Expectations have been lowered to a point where a 4-trillion-won operating profit would relieve investors,¡¨ said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst with IBK Securities in Seoul.

He added that local brokerages have been selling Samsung shares heavily recently and they don¡¦t have much of the stock in their portfolios, while foreign investors seeking long-term gains are also buying Samsung following the recent slide.

Korea¡¦s Kospi closed up 0.2% at 1972.91.

In Australia, Rio Tinto was up 4.3%, after the company said it rejected a takeover proposal by Glencore as it wasn¡¦t in the best interest of shareholders. The possible takeover inspired a rally in large mining stocks. BHP Billiton Ltd. rose 1.7% and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. added 4.2%.

That wasn¡¦t enough to outweigh broad-based declines among banks and retailers in Australia. National Australia Bank Ltd. fell 1.0% and Commonwealth Bank of Australia lost 0.5%, pushing the S&P ASX 200 down 0.2% to 5284.20.

Stocks in Australia have fallen around 6% since the start of September, as slowing growth in China squeezes prices for commodity exports such as iron ore.

The performance of stock markets elsewhere in Asia was mixed.

Hong Kong¡¦s Hang Seng Index rose 0.5% to 23422.52. Brokerage IG said working conditions in Hong Kong are returning to normal, but the cost of the protests won¡¦t be known until trade balance numbers and other activity gauges are released in early November.

Japan¡¦s Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.7% to 15,783.83 amid a weaker dollar. Among exporters, industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp. slipped 1.1%, air conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd. fell 1.9%, and auto maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. lost 1.4%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would maintain its position on monetary policy, as expected.

Foreigners net sell S.Korean stocks in Sept - first time in 6 months

SEOUL, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Foreigners turned net sellers of South Korean stocks for the first time in six months in September as European investors dumped shares, the country's financial regulator said on Tuesday.               

Offshore investors sold a net 0.5 trillion won ($470 million) worth of South Korean shares last month, according to the Financial Supervisory Service, compared to 2.5 trillion won  of net purchases in August.               

Investors in the United Kingdom were the biggest sellers of South Korean stocks in September, offloading a net 1.0 trillion won worth in their second straight month of disposals.               

Market participants in Germany and Norway were also net sellers of 0.4 trillion won worth and 0.3 trillion won worth of shares last month, respectively.               

Japanese and U.S. investors braked the fall, net buying 1.0 trillion won and 0.8 trillion won worth of South Korean stocks in September.               

Although the FSS did not give an explanation for the selloff, concerns over third-quarter profits of chaebols (family-owned conglomerates) in South Korea have recently led foreign investors to offload some of their investments in Asia's fourth-largest economy, analysts say.               

Samsung Electronics' third quarter profit guidance lent extra weight to those concerns after it revealed earlier on Tuesday its July-September profit would be the lowest in more than three years and said short-term prospects for smartphones were uncertain.               

Meanwhile, the FSS data showed foreign investors boosted their holdings of South Korean bonds by 0.5 trillion won in September, compared to August when they reduced their holdings by 82 billion won.

Samsung Eyes Growth Beyond Smartphones

SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to invest 15.6 trillion won ($14.7 billion) to build a new cutting-edge chip-manufacturing plant in South Korea as it seeks to maintain its lead in memory chips and grow beyond smartphones.

Samsung's chip unit has become increasingly important to its profit growth as its smartphone business -- which accounts for about 60% of its total operating profit -- continues to suffer from intensifying competition from low-cost Chinese handset makers. Analysts expect demand for Samsung's memory chips to stay strong for the rest of this year amid tight global supply.

Samsung said Monday that construction of the new chip plant will begin next year, with operations to start in 2017. The new plant will be located in Pyeongtaek, a city south of Seoul.

Samsung hasn't yet decided what types of chips it will produce at the plant. Samsung's competition with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is likely to intensify in coming years as they compete to make logic chips for Apple Inc.'s iPhones. Logic chips are semiconductors that process decisions, as opposed to storing memory, to operate gadgets.

Microprocessors, considered to be the brain of a smartphone, are a type of logic chip.

The investment "will significantly influence the shaping of Samsung's future semiconductor business," Kwon Oh-hyun, co-chief and a vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, said.

Samsung typically outspends rivals when investing in high-tech chip-manufacturing facilities.

The ability to spend heavily, thanks to its hefty cash pile of $60 billion, has allowed the company to maintain its lead in memory-chip production.

By moving quickly to finer chip-process technology, Samsung is able to cut chip-manufacturing costs.

Samsung is the world's biggest producer of dynamic random access memory chips, used in personal computers and smartphones.

It also makes NAND flash-memory chips, which are used in mobile devices including digital cameras.

The investment comes as Samsung, which is to report earnings estimates for the third-quarter Tuesday, is expected to say that its operating profit likely halved from a year earlier due to the poor performance of its mobile business.

Some analysts expect the company's chip-division profits to exceed mobile phones for the first time in three years.

Samsung posted an operating profit of 10.2 trillion won in the third quarter of 2013. About a third of its profits come from chips, televisions and home appliances.

Last week Samsung, moving to capitalize on cheap labor costs, said it would invest $560 million for a new TV plant in Vietnam, saying that the complex will be used for addressing mid- to long-term demand for consumer electronics globally, including emerging markets.

In South Korea, Samsung has memory-chip production lines in Hwaseong and facilities in Giheung that focus on logic chips. The company also has chip plants in China and the U.S.

NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Micron Technologies was leading a slide in the PHLX semiconductor index on Monday after Samsung unveiled plans to spend $14.7 billion on a new chip facility.

Samsung's move marks a heavy push towards its semiconductor business to bolster profits as its smartphone dominance dwindles.

Shares of Micron were down 5.3 percent in early afternoon trading, on track for their largest daily percentage decline in more than a month. However, the stock's intrinsic valuation was already 30.5 percent below StarMine projections at its close on Friday, based on forward five-year earnings growth expectations.

The SOX index was down 1 percent.

Chipmaker Toshiba Corp fell 2.6 percent overnight in Tokyo and SK Hynix Inc lost 5.1 percent in Seoul.

Looking at the broader market, energy and consumer discretionary shares were weighing the most on the S&P 500 with the benchmark index struggling against technical resistance at its 50-day moving average in the 1,975 area.

Index snapshot at 12:03 EDT (1603 GMT):

* S&P 500 was falling 4.67 points, or 0.24 percent.

* Nasdaq Comp was losing 20.91 points, or 0.47 percent.

* Dow industrials was dropping 25.63 points, or 0.15 percent.

* Russell 2000 was falling 8.11 points, or 0.73 percent.

* S&P MidCap was dropping 3.49 points, or 0.26 percent.

* S&P SmallCap was losing 4.49 points, or 0.71 percent.

SEOUL, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Tuesday said operating profit likely fell 59.7 percent in the July-September period to 4.1 trillion won ($3.8 billion) as earnings from its market-leading smartphone division likely continued to shrink.

The guidance, released ahead of final third-quarter figures due around end-October, was lower than a 5.6 trillion won mean estimate of 43 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

It would mark the company's fourth consecutive quarter of declining operating profit.

Samsung also said third-quarter sales likely fell 20.5 percent to 47 trillion won, compared with a mean forecast for 50.9 trillion won by the Thomson Reuter I/B/E/S survey.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Move over, Elsa.

Apple's iPad is the No. 1 brand among children 6-12, beating out Disney, Nickelodeon, YouTube, Netflix, Toys 'R' Us, McDonald's, and multiple snack-food brands, according to a new survey.

Kids see the iPad as the all-in-one digital tool, according to the three-month survey by Tennessee-based consulting firm Smarty Parts. The 2014 survey results represent the culmination of the "tablet takeover," according to Smarty Pants president Wynne Tyree.

"Kids increasingly turn to iPad for games, TV shows, videos, books, homework help and communicating with friends and family," he said.

In that vein, digital entertainment as a category has seen a surge among kids and families, with brands such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, Android and Samsung Electronics posting notable increases in kids' awareness, popularity and love for a brand. The firm noted that, along with iPad, those devices and services provide entertainment that is "always on."

Over all, on the study iPad was tops with a weighted score of 898 out of 1000. The Apple tablet was followed by Hershey's (894), Oreo (885), M&M's (883), Doritos (868), Cheetos (864), with Skittles and Disney tied at 858.

Google's YouTube came in at 852, followed by Microsoft Xbox (850); Lay's (847); Kit Kat and Nickelodeon (846); Crayola (842); McDonald's (839); Nintendo Wii (838); and Reese's, Chips Ahoy! and iPod tying at 836. Netflix came in at 833, followed by iPhone (830), Toys 'R' Us (830) and Apple (829).

The online study surveyed 6,661 children and their parents, in a representative sample of U.S. households with children aged 6-12. For the 2014 study, Smarty Pants evaluated a total of 256 consumer brands across more than 20 categories.

SAMSUNG

Phone Maker Pays

$1 Billion in Royalties

In a glimpse of the financial stakes in the smartphone-patent wars, Microsoft Corp. said Friday that Samsung Electronics Ltd. paid the software giant more than $1 billion for an annual fee to use Microsoft technology in Samsung phones.

Samsung sells smartphones and tablets powered by Google Inc.'s Android software. But Microsoft has said some of its patents are included in Android technologies, such as methods for displaying multiple windows in a Web browser. Therefore, Samsung and other smartphone makers pay royalty fees to Microsoft for each Android device they sell.

Neither Samsung nor Microsoft have disclosed previously the size of these royalty payments.

Samsung hasn't responded to Microsoft's complaint. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment Friday.

EBAY

Executives Will Get

Big Bonuses from Split

EBay Inc.'s plan to spin off its PayPal payment unit will prove costly.

The company said in a filing Friday that PayPal's new chief, Dan Schulman, will have a base salary of $900,000, receive equity awards over the next year of $18 million and be eligible for as much as $29.1 million in pay for benefits he may be forfeiting from his former job at American Express Co.

Mr. Schulman's base salary is $200,000 more than the previous head of the division who left earlier this year. The pay will rise to $1 million after the split is complete, expected for later next year.

The executive is eligible for an annual bonus of as much as $1.68 million before the split and $2 million after the split.

Devin Wenig, who will rise to CEO of eBay from his current post as head of the marketplace division, will see his compensation rise too.

His base salary will rise to $900,000, from $800,000, and will jump to $1 million following the split. He is eligible for bonus payments of as much as $1.68 million before the breakup and $2 million following, eBay said.

FEDEX

Court Sides with Kansas

Drivers in Work Dispute

The Kansas Supreme Court on Friday issued an opinion that hundreds of truck drivers who delivered packages for FedEx Corp. in Kansas were employees of the Memphis, Tenn.-based express delivery company and not its independent contractors.

According to the Kansas court opinion, 479 Kansas drivers sued FedEx alleging they were improperly classified as independent contractors under Kansas law. The drivers are seeking retroactive costs and expenses, as well as overtime.

The state court issued the opinion in response to a request from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considering appeals in 20 class-action suits, including the one in Kansas. All those had been decided in FedEx's favor.

FedEx said in a statement that it fundamentally disagrees with the ruling. "At the time, we are considering available options in response to the court's decision," the company said. It added that the driver model at issue is no longer in use.

* Samsung Electronics to build chip plant in Pyeongtaek

* Facility could produce logic or memory chips

* Construction to be completed in second half of 2017 (Updates to include move in shares of U.S. chipmakers)

By Se Young Lee

SEOUL, Oct 6 (Reuters) - South Korean IT giant Samsung Electronics plans to spend $14.7 billion on a new chip facility - its biggest investment in a single plant - leaning on its semiconductor business to bolster profits as its smartphone dominance wanes.

Samsung, the world's top memory chip maker, said the plant would be located in Pyeongtaek, roughly 75 kilometres (47 miles) south of Seoul. The company said it would create 150,000 jobs, equal to about a third of the city's population.

The bet on chips comes as its smartphone business is being squeezed by Apple Inc in the premium segment and undercut by Chinese rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd in mid-to-low end. April-June operating profit for Samsung's mobile division fell in annual terms for the second straight quarter, the longest streak since at least 2011.

But with the higher demand for mobile devices come increased orders for mobile chips, and Samsung Electronics' semiconductor division will be key to propping up the company's bottom-line, analysts say.

The plant in Pyeongtaek will make either logic or memory chips, Samsung Electronics said, adding that a final decision had not been made yet.

"Right now the only part of the company that is bringing in steady profits is the semiconductor division, so it looks like the company will keep investing in the business," said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee.

The chip business is likely to be a lone bright spot in what is otherwise expected to be a poor third quarter for the South Korean giant. Samsung will issue its earnings guidance for the period on Tuesday.

The mean forecast from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 42 analysts calls for the firm's July-September operating profit to come in at 5.6 trillion won ($5.24 billion), its weakest performance since the fourth quarter of 2011.

Some analysts forecast that the semiconductor division will report stronger operating profit than the handset division in the third quarter for the first time in more than three years. The chip business recorded a 1.9 trillion won profit in the second quarter, compared with 4.4 trillion won for the mobile business.

The company's global smartphone market share has declined in annual terms in the last two quarters, according to Strategy Analytics, in step with the profit drop at its mobile division.

Shares of Samsung Electronics closed 0.9 percent higher on Monday, compared with a 0.4 percent decline in the broader market. In the United States, chipmakers were hit on the news of Samsung's increased efforts. The PHLX Semiconductor Index fell 1.3 percent, led by a 5.7 percent drop in Micron Technology.

GLUT CONCERNS

Samsung Electronics said its chip production capacity was expected to rise by a "low double-digit percentage." Construction of the new plant is scheduled to be completed by the second half of 2017.

Any capacity increase can be ominous for competitors in a deeply cyclical industry. Shares in domestic rival SK Hynix Inc fell more than 8 percent at one point on Monday after Samsung's announcement.

Market conditions for memory chips have remained favourable this year partly due to stronger-than-anticipated demand from personal computers and servers. Industry players like Samsung Electronics have so far been careful about capacity expansion, keeping supply conditions on a tight leash.

Besides SK Hynix Inc, competitors in the memory industry include Micron Technology Inc and Toshiba Corp.

"While the plant won't enter production until 2017, Samsung's investment plan hurts sentiment because it suggests that Samsung wants to make further market share gains," IM's Lee said.

Some analysts said investors may be over-reacting on SK Hynix shares, given how output from the new Samsung plant won't materialise for several years and it is not yet clear what chips will be made there.

They also noted that the investment will be spread out over three years, keeping spending on the project well within Samsung's typical annual semiconductor-related investments.

"This isn't about Samsung trying to destroy the industry cycle but trying to maximise profits from the semiconductor business," CIMB analyst Lee Do-hoon said.

PYEONGTAEK

The tech giant said it had brought forward its investment plan for Pyeongtaek by more than a year in response to calls from regional governments to help boost economic activity in the area.

"Samsung will continue to balance its domestic and foreign investments to ensure optimal global production structure," the company said.

Analysts said there could be practical benefits to having the new plant in relatively close proximity to other domestic chip plants as opposed to building one overseas. Some said building a new plant near Seoul makes it easier for the company to recruit local engineering talent as well.

"To some extent, this is also a response to the current government's call for big corporations to invest domestically," said Korea Investment Trust Management fund manager Baik Jae-yer.

The government has proposed a tax on excess profits at big corporations in an effort to prod them to spend more on investment, wages and dividends. (1 US dollar = 1,068.7500 Korean won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Edwina Gibbs, Ryan Woo and Gunna Dickson)

BREAKINGVIEWS-U.S. courts turn tail too often in foreign fights

By Reynolds Holding

NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - American courts turn tail too often in foreign fights. That may surprise Credit Suisse and other overseas targets of Uncle Sam's eye-popping penalties. But a judge recently blocked Motorola Mobility from avenging price-fixing abroad that could have affected its competitive edge stateside. It's the latest example of excessive limits on U.S. law in cross-border spats.

Jurists weren't always so skittish. Until 2010, they would happily decide securities fraud cases filed by foreign investors against overseas companies that issued stock on exchanges abroad. The Supreme Court stopped that, deciding that laws don't apply beyond American shores without an explicit say-so from Congress.

The rule is clearer in theory than practice, but some judges have taken it too far. Motorola Mobility sued Korea's Samsung Electronics and others in 2009 for allegedly inflating the price of liquid crystal displays. The company wanted damages for the displays used in any of its cellphones that may have been sold in America, no matter where they were manufactured. It relied on a law allowing suits over foreign anti-competitive behavior that directly affects U.S. commerce.

A federal judge ruled earlier this year, though, that only devices made in America were covered. That's inconsistent with both precedent and the law's explicit terms. Motorola has appealed.

It's not the first time judges have acted like wimps. Several have ruled, for example, that foreigners blowing the whistle on companies with shares listed on U.S. exchanges qualify for bounties under the Dodd-Frank financial reform but aren't protected by its anti-retaliation provisions from, say, getting fired. The courts suggested enforcing those provisions might interfere with other countries' employment practices.

Reining in Uncle Sam isn't necessarily a bad thing. The likes of BNP Paribas have accused prosecutors - though not necessarily courts - of picking on them by extracting multibillion-dollar settlements for violating American laws. They have a point. U.S. criminal fines from 2001 to 2010 were about five times greater on average for foreign companies than American ones, a University of Virginia study found.

Tossing cases and restraining prosecutors make sense when Uncle Sam's interests are slight. But to forgo punishing misconduct that inflicts harm at home undermines the rule of law. 

              
              
              
              
CONTEXT NEWS
              


- Samsung Electronics, AU Optronics and other makers of liquid crystal displays on Oct. 3 filed a brief in Motorola Mobility's appeal of a decision throwing out much of its antitrust case against those manufacturers.

- Motorola claims the companies conspired to inflate the price of displays used in some $5 billion worth of its cellphones. A U.S. District Court ruled in February that Motorola could sue over phones that were manufactured and sold in the United States, but not over devices either assembled abroad and sold in America or assembled and sold abroad.

- The company is relying on the 1982 Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, which allows lawsuits involving foreign anti-competitive behavior that has a "direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect" on U.S. commerce.

- Oral arguments in the appeal are scheduled for Nov. 13.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- Emerging Markets: 'Ethical' Investing in Emerging Markets? --- Socially responsible investing around the globe could seem folly, but some funds think it's possible

Emerging markets may not be the wilderness they once were for "socially responsible" investors.

Most investors lured by the glint of growth in markets like Brazil, South Africa and China accept the greater political, currency and liquidity risks in those markets, compared with more developed markets. But so-called socially responsible investors -- who seek to marry long-term competitive financial results with social objectives -- have to tangle with yet another risk in emerging markets: the relative lack of disclosure and universal reporting standards, which could make it harder to dig out unethical corporate behavior.

In recent years, data available for vetting investments in developing markets has become more sophisticated and more widespread. Many funds perform due diligence and use shareholder activism to push for greater disclosure and more ethical corporate practices in emerging markets.

Much debate has swirled in academic and investor forums over whether limiting investments to suit social objectives affects performance. But contrary to modern portfolio theory -- which suggests portfolio constraints would restrict performance -- experts haven't found clear evidence indicating as much for socially responsible funds over the long term.

Socially responsible investing -- more recently called "ESG" investing, for environmental, social and governance -- has been marketed for decades. Common filters avoid "sin stocks" of tobacco, alcohol and gambling companies. An example with global resonance was the widespread divestiture of holdings in South Africa in the 1980s to protest apartheid.

There were 116 funds incorporating social criteria in August, up from 77 in 2003, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. Total assets grew to $61.46 billion from $23.49 billion over the same period. A handful of these funds have emerging-markets exposure of 65% or more, such as DFA Emerging Markets Social Core Equities (DFESX).

Meanwhile, companies in emerging markets have started to adopt better disclosure practices to draw investment, and data providers have sharpened focus on social metrics to gauge whether local investments are meeting ESG standards.

"Ten years ago, that level of disclosure wasn't sufficient to measure outcomes or performance," says David Harris, ESG director at index provider FTSE. Recently, FTSE and another index provider, MSCI Inc., have built more ESG-specific indexes to help measure the performance of companies that incorporate ESG practices.

Both index providers also have developed relationships with emerging-markets exchanges. Exchanges in countries like South Africa and Brazil have led the charge among peers to use ESG indexes as a means of drawing investors.

Moreover, a push by emerging-markets companies toward integrated reporting -- which weaves reports on issues like sustainability and corporate governance alongside traditional financial accounting -- has better equipped ESG investors to evaluate their investment options, says Laura Berry, executive director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.

Still, it takes "boots on the ground," to sort it all out, Ms. Berry says. "There are so many opportunities for opacity and obfuscation that I can't overemphasize the power of the folks who are there."

Challenges also arise "when these companies aren't listed on U.S. stock exchanges and their disclosures aren't in English," says Stephanie Cuttler Aument, a sustainability analyst at Calvert Investments.

That extra work sometimes costs investors. Fees for ESG funds "skew toward the high end" of fund fees, though the sampling is small, says David Kathman, an analyst at Morningstar. The average sustainable and responsible investment fund is more expensive than 60% of its peer group of similar funds, according to Morningstar.

The bigger worry for some is whether restricting investment options will limit a fund's performance. Experts haven't been able to isolate whether social screens help or hurt performance given the variety of other factors at play, such as manager skill, investor sophistication and the small sample size.

"You're more constrained," says Gerardo Zamorano, a director of investments at Brandes Investment Partners, a subadviser for Timothy Plan Emerging Markets Fund (TPEMX). "But you can still put together a pretty strong portfolio."

Generally speaking, Mr. Zamorano says, investors should be encouraged by the improving fundamentals in emerging markets over the past 15 years, such as shrinking debt-to-GDP ratios and low share valuations compared with developed markets.

Indeed, many ESG investors see long-term opportunity in emerging markets, arguing that better governance will improve performance.

Some funds that focus on ethics concerns visit company boardrooms and operations, and form alliances with like-minded local groups to root out trouble spots and monitor progress. Boston Common Asset Management has worked to improve many corporate practices, including worker safety in Bangladesh after the Rana Plaza factory collapse there killed more than 1,100.

Some efforts take years to yield results. Boston Common in 2005 approached South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. about improving disclosure of its use of so-called conflict minerals, which are mined in areas of unrest and produce revenue that could fund local violence. By 2012, Samsung improved disclosure and had adapted the industry code of conduct, says Lauren Compere, managing director at Boston Common.

Samsung declined to comment.
