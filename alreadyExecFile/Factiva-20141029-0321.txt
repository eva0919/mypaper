SEOUL¡XLG Electronics Inc. said Wednesday its third-quarter net profit nearly doubled from a year earlier after it sold a record number of smartphones.

The South Korean electronics company continued to eat into its bigger rival Samsung Electronics Co.¡¦s market share for mobile devices, particularly at home. But globally, LG is struggling against Apple Inc. and faces a newer challenge from fast-rising Chinese handset makers.

LG said its net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 87% to 203 billion won ($194 million) from 108.5 billion won a year earlier.

The company sold 16.8 million smartphones during the quarter, up 39% from 12 million sold a year earlier and a record for the company. Operating profit doubled to 461 billion won, with the mobile division accounting for more than a third of profits, the company said.

Following its second consecutive quarter of profit in the mobile division, LG said it will stick to a two-track smartphone strategy spearheaded by the company¡¦s premium G series and cheaper L series models.

Local analysts estimate LG¡¦s global market share came close to 5% in the latest quarter, a tad higher from last year¡¦s levels. But a continued tug of war is expected against upstart Chinese brands such as Xiaomi Inc., which is estimated by analysts to have sold a similar number of smartphones as LG during the same period.

LG is better positioned in South Korea, where it grabbed a 27% handset market share in the third quarter, its highest in years, and up from just 18% a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. During the same period, Samsung¡¦s share slipped to 60% from 66%, according to the same estimates.

LG executives hope the progress it is making at home will translate into overseas sales.

¡§Before, they [overseas partners] didn¡¦t even spare us a glance. But now, most carriers take our products without any doubt,¡¨ said Chris Yie, a vice president for marketing at LG¡¦s mobile division, said in a recent interview.

The number of global carriers that placed orders for LG¡¦s latest G3 smartphone at launch was roughly 170, up by 30% from the previous model, Mr. Yie said. The big four U.S. telecom companies¡XVerizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp.¡Xall sell the G3. Analysts estimate Samsung to have had roughly 200 carrier partners for the launch of its latest top-of-the-line model, the Galaxy S5.

Bankers still feeling the buzz of Alibaba Group¡¦s blockbuster listing last month have been casting around for the next big tech deal out of China. If the appetite by creditors to lend to Xiaomi Inc. is anything to go by, this four-year-old smartphone maker could be it.

Xiaomi, which sells more smartphones than even Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. in China, has borrowed $1 billion from 29 banks for a three-year loan, its first move to tap overseas funds for cash. The smartphone maker has moved beyond China to sell in India and Indonesia, and a person familiar with the loan said it is raising the funds from the loan to expand overseas.

The three-year, $1 billion loan is set to close Friday, with Brazil¡¦s Banco do Brasil to Japan¡¦s Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ among the 29 that have joined Wall Street and Chinese banks as lenders, people familiar with the matter said.

The lead bankers on the loan are Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, with Credit Suisse Group and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also taking part.

In attracting so many banks to its loan, Xiaomi has beaten Alibaba, which borrowed $8 billion last year from 22 banks, many of whom, bankers said, were eager to get in on the Chinese e-commerce giant¡¦s IPO mandate.

SEOUL, Oct 29 (Reuters) - South Korean shares rallied to a fresh 3-week high on Wednesday, buoyed by expectations that the U.S Federal Reserve will take a dovish stance regarding the timing of its next interest rate hike.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) soared 1.84 percent to close at 1,961.17 points, it's highest since October 8.

Shares in LG Electronics surged 4.3 percent after announcing its third-quarter earnings guidance during afternoon trade, which showed July-September profits had more than doubled compared to a year before.

Samsung Heavy Industries shares jumped 7.1 percent after a 288 billion won ($275.07 million) share buyback plan, disclosed via regulatory filing.

The South Korean won was slightly firmer, as dollar bulls were reined in by expectations of the Fed reassuring the market that interest rates could be maintained at near zero levels for a considerable time.

* S.Korea president sees weak yen as risks to economy
    * Won has chart resistance around 1,043 per dollar
    * Ringgit gains on weak dollar

 (Adds text, updates crisis)
    By Jongwoo Cheon
    SINGAPORE, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Most emerging Asian currencies
rose on Wednesday as the dollar eased on expectations that the
U.S. Federal Reserve will reaffirm its intention to wait longer
before hiking interest rates.
    South Korea's won hit a one-month-high as Seoul
shares rallied, and on expectations of exporters' demand
from month-end settlements.
    The currency pared some gains as caution grew over possible
intervention to stem its strength as President Park Geun-hye
said she was concerned about the impact of a weaker yen.
Some traders suspected dollar bids from the authorities.
    The Malaysian ringgit advanced as investors cut
long dollar positions.
    The Fed is expected to announce the end of its bond-buying
programme when it concludes a two-day policy meeting later on
Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is unlikely to flag a rise in
interest rates soon due to slow global growth and low inflation.
 
    Emerging Asian currencies have priced in such expectations
and investors may hesitate to chase regional units, especially
on sustained concerns over slowing growth in major economies,
analysts said.
    "A dovish Fed may support Asia FX further. Still, I doubt
how much more they can strengthen from here unless Europe and
China economies improve," said Jeong My-young, Samsung Futures'
research head in Seoul.
    
    WON
    The won rose as much as 0.4 percent to 1,045.6 per dollar,
its strongest since Sept. 26.
    South Korea's central bank views exports as faring well
despite the won's relative strength to currencies of its trading
partners, a Bank of Korea official said earlier. 
    The local currency pared some of its earlier gains as Park
said the economy faces the risk of falling into a long-term
slump, citing low growth, low inflation and a softer yen. South
Korean and Japanese companies compete head-on for a similar
group of products on major markets around the world.
    Against the yen, the won gained 0.2 percent to
9.6608, its strongest since Oct. 6.
    Traders hesitated to chase the won further, seeing chart
resistance around 1,043 per dollar.
    It has a 200-day moving average at 1,043.1 and the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement at 1,043.0 of its depreciation
between September and October.
    Some analysts saw "good chances" to buy the won against the
dollar on dips with stops below 1,038.    
    
    RINGGIT
    The ringgit gained in thin trading as investors cut dollar
holdings on expectations that the Fed will take a dovish stance.
    The Malaysian currency also advanced against the
neighbouring Singapore dollar.

* Q3 operating profit $440 mln vs $434 mln analyst f'casts

* LG's mobile profit at 5-yr high on record smartphone shipments

* Shares extend gains, outperform broader market

SEOUL, Oct 29 (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics Inc on Wednesday said its July-September operating profit more than doubled from a year earlier as earnings from its mobile business surged to a five-year high.

The world's No. 2 television maker after domestic rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said profits for its TV business grew 5.2 percent from a year earlier, while smartphone shipments rose to a fresh record.

"LG's earnings reflected strong performance from its mobile business," the company said in a statement.

LG reported an operating profit of 461 billion won ($440.21 million), better than a 454 billion won mean estimate from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of 36 analysts.

LG's mobile division turned a 167 billion won operating profit, its highest since the third quarter of 2009 and compared with a 79.7 billion won loss a year ago, thanks in part to strong shipments for the flagship G3 smartphone.

The pickup contrasts with domestic rival Samsung, which is expected to report its weakest quarterly operating profit in more than three years on Thursday, following a lacklustre run of new product launches.

While LG does not disclose individual product numbers, IM Investment analyst Kim Woon-ho estimated before the earnings disclosure that LG likely shipped a little over 3 million G3s during the period.

LG said it shipped 16.8 million smartphones during the third quarter, a record but well below Samsung, which some analysts estimate shipped more than 80 million units.

LG's TV division reported a 131 billion won operating profit, compared with 124 billion a year ago as sales of high-end products like ultra high-definition TVs grew. On Tuesday the company said it would wind down its plasma television business by end-November, signalling an imminent demise for a technology that has been overtaken by liquid crystal display.

Shares of LG Electronics extended gains following the results and were last up 4.2 percent in afternoon trade compared with a 1.7 percent rise for the broader market.

TSMC Adds LG To Customer Base

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has boosted its profile in the chip-manufacturing industry by signing deals with Apple Inc., has added LG Electronics Inc. to its list of customers for the high-tech chipsets used in smartphones.

LG Electronics said Friday that it has developed its own microprocessor to power a variation of its flagship G3 smartphone, a first for the South Korean electronics company. Thus far, LG has relied mainly on Qualcomm Inc. for the chips that run its smartphones.

"The chips will be made by TSMC, as LG doesn't have chip factories," a person familiar with the matter said. He said LG and TSMC have been working together for months to develop the new chipset, dubbed Nuclun, but didn't provide further details.

Specifications for the Nuclun aren't quite at top-notch level, but they are similar to the chips that power other premium smartphones, according to LG. For example, one version of Samsung Electronics Co.'s Galaxy Note 4 smartphone comes with a mobile processor similar in structure to the Nuclun, just slightly faster.

With the new push into chip development, LG said it was aiming to further diversify its product strategy against stronger competition. Following a period of losses, LG's mobile unit has been in recovery in recent months thanks to a better-than-expected reception for the company's G3 model, which was launched earlier this year.

But it is too early to tell if LG's internally developed chipsets will bring the company success. Making the right microprocessor has been a challenge even for Samsung, which has a long history of expertise in chip making, analysts say. Samsung-branded mobile processors, called the Exynos series, haven't been a popular choice, even for its Galaxy lineup of smartphones. LG used to have its own chip business but divested itself of the division in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s as a part of a broad restructuring of the country's conglomerates.

* Low growth, low inflation, weak yen are risks to economy

* President Park says "golden time" to rebuild economy

* Park wants speedier handling of law bills (Recasts with analyst, markets)

By Ju-min Park and Choonsik Yoo

SEOUL, Oct 29 (Reuters) - South Korean President Park Geun-hye warned the economy is at risk of falling into long-term stagnation and urged for speedier handling of economic law bills in parliament.

Low growth, low inflation and a weak Japanese yen, along with a fast-ageing population, were key economic risks, Park said in a televised speech in parliament, noting that the country was at a crossroads between growth and stagnation.

Park's remarks come as indicators underline worsening consumer confidence and weak global demand. Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan has held a similarly bleak assessment of the economy since introducing a series of stimulus measures in July.

"We are at the crossroads between achieving another leap forward and falling into a stagnation, and this is the golden time to rebuild the economy," Park said, while the government submitted next year's budget bill to parliament.

Asia's fourth-largest economy will probably pick up to grow around 3.5 percent this year from 3.0 percent in 2013, Park said, but she added the economy was still in crisis as the outlook remained uncertain both locally and globally.

The won pared losses while bond futures rose as Park's renewed warning of long-term stagnation reinforced the market's view the central bank could loosen monetary policy.

RATE CUT CHANCES RISE

The government is seeking parliamentary approval for next year's budget bill, including plans to increase fiscal spending by 5.7 percent to 376.0 trillion won ($359.4 billion) from this year - a bigger increase in spending than previously projected.

The country's fiscal year starts on Jan. 1 and parliament is due to finalise the budget plans by Dec. 2, although it has frequently missed the deadline.

The Bank of Korea was seen under pressure to cut rates, the fourth time it would do so since the middle of last year.

"On the surface, I think her comments were mainly aimed at arousing public pressure over the main parties to finalise next year's budget bill in time, but these remarks helped reinforce expectations among traders for a fresh rate cut," said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at HI Investment and Securities.

The Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate by a total of 75 basis points in three steps since May last year and traders were almost equally split over the likelihood of another rate cut, Park of HI said.

The won was trading at 1,047.6 per dollar at 0351 GMT, off a session high of 1,045.6. December futures on three-year treasury bonds were up 0.02 points at 107.88.

President Park reiterated her commitment to transforming the economy into a more balanced one between manufacturing and service sectors and between exports and domestic operations.

South Korea's economy is heavily influenced by a few big manufacturing-based business conglomerates, such as Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor, and Park has pledged to change the structure.

But her government has not taken any bold steps toward weakening the power of the conglomerates, known as chaebol, but is instead trying to encourage the creation of smaller companies and expand financial support for smaller enterprises.

Government data shows the combined annual sales of the country's top five chaebol amounted to 831 trillion won in 2013, equivalent to 58 percent of the country's annual gross domestic product - up from 40 percent in 2004.

LG-Samsung Rivalry Intensifies

Samsung Electronics Co. has been battling Apple Inc. in the cutthroat global smartphone market, but in its own backyard, the South Korean technology giant has been fighting off a half-century-old rival, LG Electronics Inc.

While it isn't yet a big material threat like low-cost Chinese makers, LG has been nibbling at Samsung's smartphone market share and is becoming a bigger player in a number of product categories, including TVs and home appliances, and gaining technological edge in key components like displays. The two keep very close tabs each other's product launch plans, according to people familiar with the matter.

To be sure, LG's gains are coming in Samsung's massive shadow. Samsung's revenue of 229 trillion won ($218 billion) for 2013 is nearly four times bigger than LG's 58 trillion won revenue for the same period, and Samsung's 30.5 trillion won net profit dwarfs LG's 223 billion won. In the second quarter, Samsung had a 25.2% share of the global smartphone market, while LG had 4.9%, according to researcher Strategy Analytics. Samsung remains a dominant force in terms of shipments for TVs and memory chips.

But when Samsung released its third-quarter earnings estimates earlier this month, its struggles in the smartphone market became ever more apparent. Samsung said its operating profit in the third quarter more than halved from a year earlier, largely due to weakness in its smartphone business. Its TV and display unit isn't expected to have done any better.

LG, which reports earnings on Wednesday, is expected to see its operating profit as much as double, according to analysts, thanks to a better-than-expected reception of the G3 smartphone it launched in May. In South Korea, LG grabbed a 27% handset market share in the third quarter, its highest in years, and up from just 18% a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. During the same period, Samsung's share slipped to 60% from 66%.

LG's display-making affiliate, LG Display Co., is poised to top its bigger rival Samsung Display Co. in both revenue and profit in the third quarter on solid sales of high-end screens used in Apple's iPhones as well as LG's flagship G series phones. Meanwhile, LG Display's growing expertise in large-size, next-generation displays has allowed LG Electronics to beat Samsung in the launch of a series of curved-screen and super-thin TV sets.

Still, in a sign that Samsung is becoming increasingly conscious of its much-smaller hometown rival, the company took a page from LG's playbook by introducing a rear-button function with its latest Galaxy Note 4 smartphone, which LG first introduced in its G2 smartphone last year.

LG didn't miss out on the rare opportunity to mock its bigger rival by tweeting through one of its official accounts: "Thank you 4 taking Note." Samsung declined to comment on the tweet.

For decades, the crosstown rivals have taken pride in pioneering technologies used in everything from TVs and refrigerators to washing machines and mobile devices. They compete in nearly identical global markets and product categories.

Their rivalry culminated in a bitter fight in September when LG executives entered an electronics shop in Berlin and allegedly broke the doors of multiple high-end Samsung washing machines. Samsung swiftly filed a formal complaint with the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, requesting an investigation. LG denied allegations of ill intent, saying the executives were casually "checking out" the doors when they unexpectedly broke. LG also took the occasion to highlight that it outsells Samsung in washing machines, one of the few categories where LG tops Samsung.

The incident is under investigation by the South Korean authorities. The prosecutors' office declined to comment on ongoing probes.

LG -- which began in 1958 as a company called Gold Star, a maker of radios -- has a history of falling behind Samsung in technological prowess. Its revenue was almost on par with that of Samsung, which was established in 1969, as a maker of black-and-white TVs, until the mid-1980s, when Samsung made a lucrative push into computers and semiconductors.

The gap widened after the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, when the government forced LG to divest its chip business as a part of a broad restructuring of the conglomerates known as chaebols. That chip business became SK Hynix Inc., the world's second-largest memory chip maker after Samsung.

When word was circulating last year that LG Electronics would introduce an "industry first" curved-screen smartphone in the fourth quarter, Samsung surprised the market at a media event in September 2013 with news of its own curved-screen phone. Samsung launched its Galaxy Round smartphone the following month exclusively in South Korea.

LG launched its LG G Flex in November, and rolled it out in global markets. Sales figures haven't been disclosed for either of the curved-screen phones.

Following LG's successful G3 phone launch this year, Samsung responded in September with a new phablet, dubbed the Galaxy Note Edge, with a screen that wraps over one edge to display messages.

"It comes down to what kind of benefits our product can provide to customers, because we can't earn money without customer satisfaction," said Chris Yie, vice president for marketing at LG's mobile unit. Mr. Yie said LG is preparing to counter Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge, without going into specific details.

The two companies appear to have selected their next battleground: A team of LG Display engineers is working to bring flexible screens that can fold in half for smartphones, while Samsung Display aims to start production at its flexible-display production line early next year.

Xiaomi Defends Its Smartphone Business Model; Markets Chosen to Fit Low-Cost Approach, Hugo Barra Says

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.¡XChinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. said its international expansion plans are dictated by choosing markets where its low-cost business model will work well and not by avoiding areas of potential intellectual-property-litigation risk sweeping across the smartphone industry.

Speaking at the WSJD Live Global Technology Conference, Hugo Barra, Xiaomi¡¦s global vice president, said it looks for markets where the price of a smartphone constitutes a large part of a consumer¡¦s income. Those markets, Mr. Barra said, are where Xiaomi¡¦s model of selling smartphones at near cost works especially well.

Xiaomi passed Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. to become the best-selling smartphone provider in China in the second quarter, according to Canalys, a research firm. It has moved into India, Indonesia and other parts of Asia. Mr. Barra said the company is looking at a move into Brazil and Mexico next.

Xiaomi has taken the Chinese smartphone market by storm. It offers its phones at rock-bottom prices, often selling out new models online in minutes. It makes money by charging for services and accessories that accompany the phones. It also relies on a legion of loyal fans to test new features and drum up enthusiasm for the company.

But for all of Xiaomi¡¦s successes, rivals and critics have said the company would face patent infringements if it expanded to the U.S. or Europe because it doesn¡¦t have enough intellectual property to strike cross-licensing patent deals with other smartphone manufacturers.

¡§Our situation when it comes to patents is the same as everyone else,¡¨ said Mr. Barra, noting that his company files for a significant number of patents in China and strikes licensing deals abroad. Litigation risk ¡§is not a determining factor¡¨ in deciding the best markets for Xiaomi¡¦s international expansion, he said.

The issue came to prominence earlier this month when Jony Ive, Apple¡¦s senior vice president of design, was asked about Xiaomi and how some smartphone designs seem to resemble the iPhone. Without mentioning Xiaomi specifically, the usually soft-spoken Mr. Ive said it was ¡§theft¡¨ and called it ¡§lazy.¡¨

Mr. Barra said there is no such thing as a completely unique design language in the smartphone industry, noting that Apple¡¦s iPhone 6 takes a chapter from designs by Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp. He says that what Apple does is no different than what Xiaomi does. ¡§This idea of building upon great ideas and putting a twist on it is what we do,¡¨ he said.

An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.

Xiaomi¡¦s smartphones run on a version of Google Inc.¡¦s Android operating system. Xiaomi is sometimes called ¡§the Apple of China¡¨ for the excitement it generates among consumers. Xiaomi sold about 18 million phones in the past year and it is forecasting sales of 60 million units this year.

The company poses a threat to other smartphone manufacturers because of its willingness to accept low margins on hardware to make money elsewhere. For example, Xiaomi¡¦s popular Redmi phone is about a quarter of the price of the iPhone 6, which sells for more than $800 in China.

¡§We fundamentally believe that innovation is not a luxury item. Innovation is for everyone,¡¨ said Mr. Barra. ¡§We fundamentally believe that when it costs you $200 to make something, you shouldn¡¦t sell it for $600.¡¨

Mr. Barra reiterated that the company has been moving data belonging to international users to servers outside China¡Xin Singapore and North America¡Xin an effort to assuage users¡¦ concerns about privacy. He said the decision to migrate servers outside of China was driven partially by a desire to improve performance by reducing network outages and latency, but he said users like to have data close.

¡§It makes people feel better that they have data next to them,¡¨ Mr. Barra said.

¡§Chinese companies are held to a higher standard than other companies out there.¡¨

Alevo pulls back the curtain on its batteries for the grid

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Alevo Group, which has kept its energy storage technology secret for a decade, unveiled it on Tuesday, and said it has struck deals aimed at deploying its batteries in power grids in China and Turkey.

Aleveo 's chief executive, Norwegian entrepreneur Jostein Eikeland, made the announcement in front of 500 people at a North Carolina factory it bought earlier this year.

The company's batteries would store excess electricity generated by power plants.

Alevo said it has $1 billion in funding from anonymous Swiss investors and has accepted no government incentives. It plans to hire 2,500 people within three years.

The Martigny, Switzerland-based company has yet to sign up any U.S. customers but said on Tuesday that it has reached a deal with China-ZK International Energy Investment Co Ltd, which will promote and commercialize Alevo's energy storage systems in China.

Alevo has also formed a joint venture with Washington-based international construction and project management firm The Sandi Group and Turkish infrastructure service provider RBM to deploy its batteries in Turkey.

Eikeland had kept Alevo's technology secret for more than a decade. Onstage at Tuesday's event, he opened a curtain to reveal a storage container filled with lithium iron phosphate Alevo batteries.

The company calls the containers GridBanks, meaning they can "deposit electrons and take them out when we need it," Eikeland said.

Alevo said its batteries are better than anything else on the market because they last longer and contain an inorganic electrolyte that reduces the risk of burning. The company is offering a 20-year warranty on its batteries.

Alevo has teamed up with manufacturer Parker Hannifin Corp , which developed the power conversion systems for the GridBanks.

Grid storage has become critical as more renewable energy - such as solar power or wind power - is introduced into the world electricity supply. Batteries can store power generated during windy nights to use during the day when the wind may not be blowing, or can extend solar power into the hours after the sun goes down.

But the technologies needed to store large amounts of power are too expensive to deploy on a massive scale. Alevo says it will change that because its batteries can be charged and discharged four times as much as rival technologies.

Alevo's products will compete with those of established manufacturers like Samsung and France's Saft Groupe SA as well as a handful of privately held startups like Enervault and Primus Power. (Reporting By Nichola Groom; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)

UPDATE 1-Smartphone launches boost Gorilla glass maker Corning

By Abhirup Roy

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Corning Inc, the supplier of Gorilla glass to Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics , reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings, helped by launches of new smartphone models.

Shares of the company, which also supplies LCD panels to consumer electronics companies such as Sony Corp, LG and Lenovo Group, rose 1.6 percent in early trading.

Smartphones such as Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and Samsung's Galaxy Alpha were launched in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Corning said it would launch a new version of Gorilla glass on Nov. 20.

The company, however, said fourth-quarter core sales in its speciality materials business, which makes Gorilla glass, were expected to decline by low- to mid-teen digits percent from the third quarter due to the absence of any major new launches.

"What happens after a new launch is at some point, they take enough glass to continue to build out their products and that's why we think that in the fourth quarter, we'll see sales down," Senior Vice President Tony Tripeny told Reuters.

Its LCD panel volumes in the current quarter are expected to be flat or fall slightly from the previous quarter as most of the holiday season orders had been shipped in the third quarter, Tripeny said.

Corning had been hurt by falling LCD glass prices in the past few quarters, but the company said the pace of the price decline was moderating.

The company's core net sales rose to $2.65 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.1 billion, a year earlier.

Net income rose to $1.01 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $408 million, or 28 cents per share.

The company reported core earnings of 40 cents per share.

Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of 37 cents per share and revenue of $2.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Corning shares were up 1 percent at $19.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by Kirti Pandey)

Asia Naphtha/Gasoline-Naphtha crack recovers from 27-month low

SINGAPORE, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The Asian naphtha crack rose
slightly from a 27-month low on Tuesday to $59.18 a tonne, with
a lower Brent price and spot demand giving a temporary lift to
an over-supplied market, traders said.
    South Korea's Samsung Total bought a full-range naphtha
cargo for first-half December delivery at a discount wider than
$13 a tonne to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis,
they said. 
    The steep discounts reflected the level of oversupply in
Asia, where prices are rarely in the negative zone because the
region is usually short of the feedstock. 
    This changed in August after the West, including Europe and
the Mediterranean lined up a massive amount of cargoes to be
shipped to the East. 
    The situation could deteriorate further for sellers, traders
said, as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is expanding its Ruwais
refinery which is due to be completed soon. UAE's naphtha
exports are expected to increase. 
    The weak market has weighed on sellers all over Asia.
    Bangladesh Petroleum Corp (BPC) offered 170,000 barrels for
Nov. 27-29 loading from Chittagong for the second time after
receiving low bids in its earlier offer, said a BPC official. 
    The new tender will close on Nov. 17, with bids to stay
valid until Nov. 17. 
    
    TENDERS: Thailand's IRPC offered 30,000 tonnes of heavy
naphtha for Dec. 5-28 loading from Rayong in a tender closing on
Oct. 31. 
    India's Essar Oil offered 35,000 tonnes of naphtha for Nov.
23-27 loading from Vadinar in a tender closing on Oct. 30. 
    Egypt, which has a quarterly contract ending December with
Total, has offered similar volumes but for Dec. 22-24 loading
from Suez in a tender closing on Nov. 10. 
    Indonesia's Pertamina was seeking 100,000 barrels of
92-octane gasoline for Nov. 8-10 delivery to Tanjung Gerem and
another 100,000 barrels for Nov. 13-15 arrival at Jakarta in a
tender closing on Oct. 30. 

    SINGAPORE CASH DEALS: One deal each on naphtha and gasoline.
    Vitol sold to PTT a 92-octane gasoline cargo for Nov. 23-27
loading from Singapore at a premium of $1.40 a barrel to
Singapore quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis. 
    Vitol, on the other hand, bought a first-half January
naphtha cargo from Sietco at $711 a tonne.

UPDATE 1-LG Elec exit suggests end is near for plasma TVs

* LG Electronics says to wind down plasma TV business by end-Nov

* Plasma TV in long decline as LCD TVs became mainstream (Updates with comments, details on plasma)

SEOUL, Oct 28 (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics Inc said it will wind down its plasma television business by end-November, as a technology long overtaken by liquid crystal display takes one step closer to its demise.

LG Electronics said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that the decision reflects a decline in demand for plasma TVs, with the business accounting for 2.4 percent of its 2013 annual revenue. The exit was widely anticipated as LCD TVs have become the mainstay in global markets.

"We wanted to keep it going as long as we could," LG spokesman Ken Hong told Reuters, noting that LG Electronics has been making its own plasma panels. "No matter how much we try to keep it going it's just not a business anymore."

Analysts said plasma displays were technically unable to catch up to the advances in screen resolutions, and it also consumed more power and generated more heat than LCD.

"All those factors combined to push industry players to concentrate on LCD technology," said Seoul-based IBK Securities analyst Eo Kyu-jin.

Market research firm NPD DisplaySearch said in July that global plasma TV shipments will fall to 500,000 in 2015 from 5.2 million in 2014, all but disappearing from the market.

Japan's Panasonic Corp said in October last year that it would pull out of the plasma TV business. Once LG exits, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd would be the last major player.

Samsung says it plans to continue making plasma TVs but declined to say where it would get the plasma panels once sister company Samsung SDI Co Ltd pulls out of the business by end-November. (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Ryan Woo)

Samsung heir apparent moves to tighten grip on group firms

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Group heir apparent Jay Y. Lee is moving to acquire small stakes in two of the group's financial firms, which analysts say will help the scion solidify control of South Korea's largest conglomerate as a succession looms.

Lee is seeking regulatory approval to purchase 0.1 percent each of Samsung Life Insurance Co Ltd <032830.KS> and Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance Co Ltd <000810.KS>, Samsung Group said in a statement. He is reinvesting after-tax proceeds of 25.2 billion won ($23.97 million) from selling Samsung Asset Management Co Ltd shares to Samsung Life earlier this year.

Although the companies are already firmly in Samsung Group's grasp, analysts said direct ownership would allow Lee to formally influence how they are managed. Samsung Life is also at the heart of Samsung's complicated shareholding structure and will play an important role in any succession planning.

Samsung declined to comment on why Jay Y. Lee was buying the shares.

Samsung patriarch Lee Kun-hee has been hospitalized since May following a heart attack, putting impetus on his children to ensure a stable transfer of control. Jay Y. Lee, who is the only son, is widely expected to take over crown jewel Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS>, as well as the financial firms.

"I think we're now seeing efforts to establish a Jay Y. Lee regime in earnest," said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of research firm Chaebul.com.

MORE MOVES POSSIBLE

Korea Investment Trust Management fund manager Baik Jae-yer said going through the regulatory approval process for Samsung Life now could also serve as a test run ahead of an eventual inheritance of his father's shares in the insurer. The elder Lee is Samsung Life's biggest single stakeholder at 20.8 percent.

"I think this process helps him identify any potential legal hurdles when he looks to inherit those shares," Baik said. The Financial Services Commision will likely decide whether to approve the purchases on Wednesday, said an official at the financial regulator who declined to be named.

Samsung Group said the younger Lee had no plans to buy more shares in Samsung Life or Samsung Fire & Marine at present. Analysts saw no need for additional purchases to bolster his influence and believed he was more likely to prepare for the inheritance of his father's Samsung Life stake.

The conglomerate has pushed through major initiatives to streamline its structure, including a merger of Samsung Heavy Industries Co Ltd <010140.KS> and Samsung Engineering Co Ltd <028050.KS> approved by shareholders on Monday.

Chaebul.com's Chung said Jay Y. Lee could buy shares in other key group companies such as Samsung C&T Corp <000830.KS> and Samsung Heavy Industries to further tighten his grip, in line with the strategy pursued by his father.

"Though they may not be big, Lee Kun-hee owns shares in the key affiliates to ensure that he can exert direct control," Chung said.

"Eventually, the shareholding structure will need to become more streamlined but that will take a lot of time and resources, so such stake purchases by Jay Y. Lee will help to maintain control in the meantime."

LG Electronics says to end production of plasma display TVs

SEOUL, Oct 28 (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics Inc said on Tuesday that it will end the production of plasma display televisions by end-November in order to focus its efforts on liquid crystal display and OLED televisions.

LG Electronics said in a regulatory filing the decision reflects a decline in demand for plasma televisions. The move was widely expected as LCD TVs have become the mainstay product in the global market.

Samsung SDI Co Ltd, sister company of LG's TV rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, also said in July that it will shut down its plasma panel production business by Nov. 30 due to the decline in overall demand. (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)

* Q3 EBIT loss widens 70 pct to 17.9 mln euros from Q2

* Still sees 2014 revenue flat, EBIT loss

* Shares indicated to open 2.8 pct lower (Adds comment, detail, background, shares)

FRANKFURT, Oct 28 (Reuters) - German chip equipment maker Aixtron said on Tuesday its quarterly operating loss had widened as its stepped up investments in new tools and utilisation rates at its light emitting diode (LED) chip customers dropped.

The company said its loss before interest and tax (EBIT) for the third quarter through September widened to 17.9 million euros ($22.7 million) from 10.6 million in the second quarter.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had, on average, expected a loss of 10 million euros.

The company said it still expected 2014 revenue to remain flat compared with last year's 182.9 million euros, while its operating result would improve but remain in the red.

Aixtron said it was experiencing a pick-up in customer interest for its non-LED technologies and applications but it also warned that its LED customers were facing "very competitive industry dynamics".

"This could lead to further consolidation and also to continued requirements for lower total cost of ownership of equipment," the company said.

The warning comes a day after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said that it will cease its LED lighting business outside of South Korea, reflecting what analysts said was growing competition from Chinese manufacturers.

Aixtron shares were indicated to open 2.8 percent lower, with the German blue chip index seen opening 0.7 percent higher.

WSJ.D Technology: Samsung's Primacy Is Tested By Rise of Chinese Players

SHANGHAI -- Samsung Electronics Co.'s attempt to stay on top of the fast-changing smartphone business will depend on winning back people like He Wenzong.

The 30-year-old apparel-company employee and Shanghai resident last year traded his Galaxy S3 phone, one of Samsung's most successful products, for a handset made by Beijing-based upstart Xiaomi Inc., which a few months ago displaced Samsung as China's No. 1 smartphone seller.

Xiaomi's phone offers better software and services, Mr. He says, at a fraction of a new Samsung's price. "To me, it looks like it's the same quality, but one costs 2,000 yuan ($327) and the other is 3,500 yuan," says Mr. He. "So why would I pick Samsung?"

Across China -- and around the globe -- other people are starting to feel the same way. Samsung has lost its top position for mobile-phone sales in India, and research firms that track smartphone shipments say it is in danger of being toppled in Thailand and the Philippines. Though Samsung is still the No. 1 smartphone maker globally, it has been losing market share in recent quarters.

In China, where Samsung gets 18% of its total sales, the company is parachuting in executives and outside consultants to assess the problem and figure out how to fix it, according to people with knowledge of the moves. The company is lowering prices for its existing handsets by up to 20% and preparing to roll out a new, cheaper line of smartphones for emerging markets, the people said.

The steps are part of a larger attempt to shore up the mobile-phone division, which accounts for around 60% of Samsung's operating profit.

On Thursday, the company is expected to report that operating profit for the quarter ended in September has fallen by about 60% from a year earlier, following a 20% decline in the quarter before, largely because of what the company acknowledged was "increased competition" in China.

After leading sales in the Chinese smartphone market every quarter for the past two-and-a-half years, Samsung dropped behind Xiaomi during the quarter ended June, tying for second place with Lenovo Group Ltd. and Coolpad Group Ltd., according to data tracker Canalys.

Samsung has cut the bonuses of hundreds of managers in its mobile division, according to people familiar with the matter. In an attempt to streamline operations, Samsung is combining many of its main business divisions in the U.S. under one chief, say people with direct knowledge of the move. That could foreshadow a similar consolidation of leadership at headquarters, where the company is run by three co-chief executives, said one of these people.

In an attempt to bring down its manufacturing costs, Samsung opened a $2 billion mobile-phone factory in Vietnam last year, and in July won approval from Vietnamese authorities for another factory to produce smartphone and tablet displays.

A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment on its China strategy or personnel moves.

Samsung began building up extensive distribution networks to sell its televisions and mobile phones in the 1990s, giving it a sizable head start versus Apple when it began roll out high-end smartphones. Since most Chinese consumers buy their phones at mobile-phone or consumer-electronics retail outlets rather than through carriers, Samsung's network of stores let it reach consumers from small villages to big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.

Recently, however, more Chinese consumers are buying phones online, and many of Samsung's Chinese rivals, like Xiaomi, sell primarily that way, which also lowers their overhead. Xiaomi sells its handsets at close to cost, aiming to make money on software and services sold over the phones instead -- a tactic that lets it undercut Samsung prices.

Samsung's Chinese rivals run Google Inc.'s Android operating system -- like the vast majority of Samsung's smartphones. But they have been more efficient at pre-loading sales-generating apps on their phones and promoting their own app stores.

Samsung, by its own admission, has been slow to respond. The company kept its prices high, even on lower-tier smartphones.

To unload excess inventory, Samsung has lowered some smartphone prices in China by between 10% and 20%, a tactic that could help it recapture some market share in the second half of the year, Canalys says.

The company is also preparing to release -- initially in China -- a new line of smartphones dubbed Galaxy A, a midrange phone that offers many of the features of a high-end Galaxy S device but is priced more competitively with Chinese phones, according to people familiar with the plans.

* KOSPI drifts lower with investors on guard ahead of FOMC
    * Won firms vs dlr as investors brace for dovish Fed
comments

    By Joonhee Yu
    SEOUL, Oct 28 (Reuters) - South Korean shares were trading
slightly lower on Tuesday morning after a choppy session as
investors waited on the sidelines ahead of the U.S Federal
Reserve's two-day policy meeting ending on Wednesday.    
    The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was
down 0.2 percent at 1,928.10 points as of 0155 GMT. 
    Data indicating a slowdown in the U.S. services sector,
which dipped to a six-month low in October, as well as weak
German business sentiment also put downward pressure on
equities. 
    The Fed is expected to announce the end of its quantitative
easing program when its meeting concludes, but analysts say it
is a foregone conclusion and don't expect markets to react
significantly.
    "We believe stocks will rally, having already priced in
concerns in September and October... and while liquidity was
almost the only concern after QE1 and QE2, economic conditions
and earnings are now also being considered," said Samsung
Securities in a note to clients.
    "With other nations turning to stimulus, global liquidity
levels should remain solid even after QE3 finishes."
    Oil refiners were battered as crude prices plumbed fresh
two-year lows, with Goldman Sachs cutting its price target of
West Texas Intermediate from $94.83 per barrel this year to
dd$73.75 in 2015.
    SK Innovation, South Korea's largest refiner,
fell 2.1 percent while S-Oil tumbled 3.3 percent.
    Defensive sectors such as telecoms bucked broader trends, as
SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile services
provider, rose 2.4 percent while KT Corp gained 2.4
percent. 
    Samsung Life Insurance shares were trading 1.4
percent higher while Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance 
added 1.9 percent after Samsung Group said its conglomerate
heir-apparent Jay Y. Lee was looking to acquire a stake in the
two insurance arms. 
    The South Korean won was a shade higher on Tuesday as
investors, braced for more dovish comments from the Federal
Reserve, turned bearish on the dollar.
    The currency was quoted at 1,050.7 to the dollar
as of 0155 GMT, compared to Monday's closing rate of 1,052.2.
    December futures on three-year treasury bonds shed 3
basis points to trade at 108.83.

SEOUL, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Samsung Group heir apparent Jay Y. Lee is looking to acquire small stakes in Samsung Life Insurance Co Ltd and Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance Co Ltd , South Korea's largest conglomerate said on Tuesday.

Lee is seeking regulatory approval to acquire a 0.1 percent stake each in Samsung Life and Samsung Fire & Marine, Samsung Group said in an email statement.

He is re-investing after-tax proceeds of 25.2 billion won ($23.97 million) from selling his stake in Samsung Asset Management Co Ltd to Samsung Life earlier this year, according to the statement.

The planned stake purchases do not represent a major change in ownership structure of both insurance companies, which are already controlled by Samsung Group.

Lee has no plans to buy more shares in Samsung Life or Samsung Fire & Marine at present, Samsung Group said, without saying why he wants to make the investments.

The Financial Services Commission, the country's financial regulator, will likely decide whether to approve the request on Wednesday, an official at the regulator said. (1 US dollar = 1,051.1000 Korean won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee and Lee Changho; Editing by Ryan Woo)

Stealthy Norwegian entrepreneur aims to revolutionize U.S. energy storage

By Nichola Groom   
880 words
27 October 2014

Reuters News
LBA

Oct 27 (Reuters) - Jostein Eikeland, a Norwegian entrepreneur with a mixed record of success, is hoping to jolt the world of energy storage.

On Tuesday, Eikeland's latest venture, Alevo, will unveil a battery that he says will last longer and ultimately cost far less than rival technologies.

The technology, which is meant to store excess electricity generated by power plants, has been developed by Eikeland in secret for a decade.

"We've been very stealth," Eikeland said in a telephone interview. "We didn't know if we were going to succeed."

Martigny, Switzerland-based Alevo Group is gearing up to start manufacturing batteries next year at a massive former cigarette plant near Charlotte, North Carolina, that it says will employ 2,500 people within three years.

Eikeland, 46, said Alevo, named for the inventor of the battery, Alessandro Volta, has $1 billion from anonymous Swiss investors and has taken no state funding or incentives.

Alternately brash and self-deprecating, Eikeland did not shy away from discussing his up-and-down past. He founded software company TeleComputing Inc during the dot-com boom, helped take it public on the Oslo stock exchange, then left in 2002 after the tech bubble burst.

He later invested heavily in and took the helm of Sweden-based auto parts manufacturer, TMG International, which went bankrupt in 2008. Broke, he was forced to sell his lavish homes to pay his taxes, according to media reports that were confirmed by representatives for Alevo.

After TMG, Eikeland spent a few years investing in software and battery technologies, many of which he admits failed.

"I know how hard it is to lose eight of your 10 fingers," he said. "I wish I had somebody else to blame."

EASIER SAID THAN DONE

Claims of technological breakthroughs from unfamiliar companies are common in the world of green technology. Many startups fizzle out before they achieve mass production. Among the recent high-profile flameouts: battery maker A123 and solar panel maker Solyndra.

"One billion dollars is a colossal amount of capital raised for any clean-tech company," said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov, who said he is not familiar with Alevo. "It doesn't mean it's going to be a smashing success."

Typically in high-tech manufacturing, companies use pilot projects to prove their technology to investors and potential customers before ramping up. That's not how Eikeland is proceeding.

"Building as big as we did, it might seem a little bit risky," said Eikeland, who described himself as "a controversial guy."

Producing on a mass scale will make Alevo's technology cost- effective from the start, Eikeland said. The high cost of grid storage has prevented it from being deployed more widely.

Eikeland plans to deliver 200 megawatts of batteries - roughly enough to power 100,000 homes - into the U.S. market next year and is in talks with big utilities, which he hopes will become customers.

Alevo's approach stands in stark contrast to the public announcement last month of Tesla Motors Inc's planned $5 billion factory in Nevada, which will make batteries for electric cars. Tesla says its plant will employ 6,500 people by 2020. It will receive more than $1 billion of state incentives.

"Building a $1 billion facility in stealth mode is definitely unusual," said Dan Reicher, executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University. Reicher, a former green technology investor, said he was not familiar with Alevo or its technology.

State and county officials in North Carolina confirmed that Alevo has not sought any business incentives.

PACKING A LOT OF POWER

The company has created what it calls GridBanks, which are shipping containers full of thousands of battery cells. Each container can deliver 2 megawatts of power, enough to power up to 1,300 homes for an hour.

The batteries use lithium iron phosphate and graphite as active materials and an inorganic electrolyte - what Eikeland called the company's "secret sauce" - that extends longevity and reduces the risk of burning. They can be charged and discharged over 40,000 times, the company said.

That is about four times as much as rival batteries, said Sam Wilkinson, who follows energy storage for IHS Technology. Wilkinson, who said he was briefed by Alevo on its plans, said that if the batteries work as promised they will constitute a technological leap.

Grid storage has become critical as more renewables are introduced into the world's power supply. For instance, batteries can store power generated during windy nights to use during the day when the wind may not be blowing, or can extend solar power into the hours after the sun goes down.

The industry is expected to grow to $19 billion by 2017 from just $200 million in 2012, according to research firm IHS CERA.

Eikeland holds several patents in the United States related to battery technology. The company will compete with established manufacturers like Samsung and France's Saft as well as a handful of privately held startups like Enervault and Primus Power.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Google makes U.S. trade arbiter look patently daft

By Reynolds Holding

NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Google is making America's trade arbiter look patently daft. The search giant and other technology companies say an International Trade Commission ban on imports of infringing items in digital form could disrupt the internet. Websites and cloud computing firms could also become even easier prey for patent trolls.

The ITC's remit is to block foreign "articles" that violate intellectual property rights. A recent case, though, raised the novel question of whether the term "articles" includes digital models imported electronically to help make teeth-straightening devices. The commission said in April that it does - despite decades of defining "articles" to mean only tangible goods.

The context makes the ruling understandable up to a point. Music, software, data for 3D printers and many other bits of information move over the internet. If that creates loopholes that skirt patents, just as clever legal structures lacking economic substance help avoid tax, say, there's an argument for making the workarounds illegal.

But that's not the ITC's call. As Google, eBay and others stress in a legal brief filed under the auspices of the Internet Association, allowing a minor U.S. agency to regulate internet traffic could seriously impede the global movement of data. It would also encourage so-called trolls, which own patents but make nothing, to file lawsuits demanding that the ITC block websites, file-sharing services and a host of other online businesses.

The commission is already a favorite forum for trolls, which account for about a quarter of its cases. And no wonder: The ITC decides disputes in half the time taken by federal courts and has more leeway to issue orders quashing alleged infringers. The likes of Apple and Samsung even use it as a battleground for their smartphone wars. The agency, created in 1916 to support American trade policy, holds almost a fifth of U.S. patent trials.

Thorny issues like how to protect intellectual property from online infringement are for Congress to decide - or at least courts steeped in precedent. A federal appeals court is about to weigh in on the teeth-straightening case. To paraphrase Google's corporate motto, it's the perfect opportunity to remind the ITC not to be evil. 

              
              
              
              
CONTEXT NEWS
              


- Google and dozens of other internet companies on Oct. 16 filed briefs urging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reverse an International Trade Commission ruling that would ban imports of digital data used to create patent-infringing products.

- The ITC ruled in April that electronically transmitted information qualifies as an "article" that can be banned under the U.S. Tariff Act. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Align Technology against ClearCorrect Operating for allegedly infringing patents on teeth-straightening devices. ClearCorrect generated digital models in Pakistan and then transmitted them to Texas so they could be transformed into actual braces.

- Oral arguments before the appeals court have not yet been scheduled.

SEOUL, Oct 27 (Reuters) - South Korean shares and the won
 were buoyed by returning risk appetite on positive
earnings results and economic data that soothed concerns over
the health of the global economy.
    The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was up
0.3 percent at 1,932.03 points as of 0200 GMT while the local
currency was up half a percent at 1,052.1 against the
dollar.
    "The KOSPI is likely to try to firmly rebound this week as
sentiment is expected to keep improving. Whether it will be able
to move safely above the 1,940 level will be closely watched,"
said Lee Kyung-min, an analyst at Daishin Securities.
    U.S. data released late on Friday showed sales of new U.S.
homes rose to a six-year high in September while third-quarter
GDP growth in Britain remained above the country's long-run
average and on track to outpace other advanced economies this
year.  
    Investors also took heart in positive earnings results from
blue chips Microsoft and Proctor & Gamble, which
propped up U.S. stocks to close out their best week in nearly
two years on Friday.
    Market participants will now look towards Wednesday, when
the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meeting this week ends and
where it is likely to announce the end of its bond-buying
programme.
    Shares of Samsung Heavy and Samsung Engineering
 both gained more than 3 percent after it was
announced shareholders approved the merger of the two companies.
 
    Foreign investors purchased a net 26.7 billion Korean
won($25.38 million) worth of KOSPI shares near mid-session,
propping up the index.
    The KOSPI 200 benchmark of core stocks was up 0.4 
percent, while the junior KOSDAQ was nearly flat up 0.1
percent.
    December futures on three-year treasury bonds ticked
down 0.01 points to trade at 107.89.

(In Oct. 23 story, corrects to change references to IC (interface controller) from fingerprint touch ID. Removes background paragraph on touch ID)

By Lehar Maan

Oct 23 (Reuters) - Touchscreen chip maker Synaptics Inc reported lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue and profit, hurt by weak demand from smartphone makers, sending its shares down 13 percent in extended trading.

The company, whose chips are used in Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's devices such as Galaxy S5 smartphones and Galaxy Note 3 phablets, also forecast current quarter revenue largely below Wall Street's expectation.

"We think its weakness is likely in touch IC (interface controller) revenue," Feltl & Company analyst Jeffrey Schreiner said.

"Given that certain Samsung designs that have come out recently (Note 4, Galaxy Alpha, Note Edge) are not using Synaptics touch IC products, we think that would probably be a real driver of the revenue decline."

The company competes with STMicroelectronics NC, Atmel Corp and Cypress Semiconductor Corp to get its touchscreen products in smartphones.

Synaptics did not say how much IC products contributed to sales in the quarter ended Sept. 30. But it said those sales were classified according to the technology's use in either a mobile phone or a personal computer.

Revenue from its PC business rose 38 percent, powering most of the 27 percent rise in total sales. Revenue from its mobile phone business rose 23 percent, accounting for 71 percent of total sales of $282.7 million.

Still, total sales fell short of the average analyst estimate of $288.4 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company's net income fell about 24 percent. On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.04 per share. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.19 per share.

"Our performance in the first quarter reflected weaker than expected customer demand trends in the mobile market, offset by greater than anticipated demand in the PC market," Chief Executive Rick Bergman said in a earnings statement.

Synaptics forecast current-quarter revenue of $415-$450 million. The mid-point of the forecast is $432.5 million, which is less than the $444.8 million Wall Street has estimated.

The stock was down 12.6 percent at $64.05 in extended trading. Up to Thursday's close Synaptics' stock has gained 41.4 percent this year, more than double the 13.2 percent rise in the Philadelphia semiconductor index. (Editing by Maju Samuel and Savio D'Souza)

Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook told a Chinese media outlet that the company's four Beijing retail stores serve about 250,000 customers a week. A Business & Finance article in the Friday-Sunday edition about Apple's plans in China incorrectly stated that Mr. Cook said it serves 750,000 customers a day in 15 Apple-branded stores across China.

(WSJA Oct. 27, 2014)

(END)

BEIJING -- Apple Inc. plans to increase the number of its Apple-brand retail stores in Greater China to 40 from 15 within two years, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday.

In an interview with Chinese news portal Sina.com, Mr. Cook said the Cupertino, Calif., company will also increase investment in China by an unspecified amount. "In the future, China will become Apple's biggest revenue contributor," he said, according to Sina.com. "It's just a matter of time."

An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the remarks. Greater China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.

China is Apple's third-largest market after the U.S. and Europe and is an important growth driver for the company. Its revenue growth in Greater China, however, slowed sharply in the latest quarter ahead of the release of its new iPhone, which was delayed by regulators in China until this month.

Mr. Cook's trip is being portrayed by some Chinese media outlets as part of the company's attempt to assuage concerns the Chinese government or public might have about the security of data stored on its phones. In July, state broadcaster China Central Television called a location-tracking function on the iPhone a "national security concern." Apple has said it doesn't keep user data.

The official Xinhua News Agency said Mr. Cook and China's Vice Premier Ma Kai "exchanged views on protection of users' information" when they met on Wednesday.

Apple faces competition in China from South Korean company Samsung Electronics Co. as well as Chinese manufacturers. Apple ranked No. 6 in China's smartphone market in the second quarter, according to research firm IDC.

Mr. Cook said Apple has 7,000 employees in China serving 750,000 customers daily in 15 Apple-branded stores. "You could say they're the world's busiest retail stores," he said.

Uncool Microsoft Grows Hot Again

Microsoft Corp. may not be cool, but its sales continue to defy expectations by growing at a much faster clip than those of its business-technology peers.

Microsoft's revenue rose 11% from a year earlier in the three months ended Sept. 30, excluding Nokia's mobile-phone business that Microsoft purchased last spring.

Meanwhile, competitors in corporate technology -- such as International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Oracle Corp. -- posted shrinking or slow sales growth.

"Microsoft is bucking the trend," said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets.

Microsoft's stock rose 3.1% in after-hours trading Thursday following the release of its financial report for the fiscal first quarter. The company's stock price has reflected strong revenue and profit growth in the past year.

Shares climbed 33% in the past year through Thursday's market close, far outpacing the S&P 500 stock index over the period.

The company's market value recently surpassed that of Google Inc. for the first time since June 2013.

The latest quarterly results continue a charmed first year in office for Satya Nadella, who in February was named chief executive, only the third in Microsoft's history.

Mr. Nadella has focused on many of the same lines of business as his predecessors, and earlier investments in cloud computing and the Xbox videogame console have paid off under his watch.

Mr. Nadella has won over Wall Street with his willingness to cut jobs, favor innovation over existing businesses and de-emphasize products outside Microsoft's core offerings.

In the most recent quarter, Microsoft's revenue from software for business customers rose more than 9.5% from a year earlier.

The company had robust growth in both newer offerings such as Microsoft Office 365 (an online version of the popular desk-jockey software suite) and mature products like the version of Windows for computer servers.

Cloud software sold to businesses -- primarily Office 365, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM sales tool and the Azure cloud-computing service -- more than doubled to $1.18 billion, or roughly 5.1% of total revenue for the quarter.

But Microsoft executives said during a conference call that customers for Azure, which lets corporate IT departments and software developers rent computing horsepower and storage capacity by the hour, also buy the company's traditional corporate software.

Microsoft's mobile business remains a trouble spot. Sales of Windows-powered Nokia smartphones rose, but the company continues to lose market share to Apple Inc. and manufacturers of phones that run Google's Android operating software.

Microsoft made less money than it did a year earlier from its mobile-phone operating software business, largely because Android-phone makers such as Samsung Electronics Co. sold more of their inexpensive phones, which generate lower fees for Microsoft. Android phone makers pay Microsoft a royalty for Microsoft patents used in the Google operating system.

Sales of Windows operating software for personal computers also declined, but less than in prior quarters, driven by improving demand for PCs since their 2013 swoon.

The company made more headway with its other consumer hardware products.

Revenue more than doubled for the Surface tablet computer, which sold poorly when it launched two years ago. The Surface Pro 3, released in June, received a more positive reception, the company said. The newer device is positioned more as a laptop replacement than a tablet computer.

Microsoft also sold twice as many Xboxes as a year ago, it said, helped by a $100 price cut for the latest model.

Despite Microsoft's recent successes, Google tends to get the buzz once reserved for the Redmond, Wash., company.

In an interview, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood was unfazed. "I wasn't that cool in high school, either," she said.

Overall in the quarter, Microsoft revenue was $23.2 billion, including the Nokia business, compared with $18.5 billion a year ago. Net income fell to $4.5 billion, or 54 cents a share, from $5.2 billion, or 62 cents, in the same quarter last year.

Microsoft's profit was weighed down by about $1.1 billion, or 11 cents a share, in part due to costs related to a massive round of job cuts Mr. Nadella pushed through this summer.

* Consumption and construction up, investment down

* Exports suffer first drop in a year

* Central bank chief says growth still not firm

* BOK official says Q3 growth benefited from govt spending, weak Q2 growth (Adds official, analyst comments and recent background)

By Christine Kim

SEOUL, Oct 24 (Reuters) - South Korea's economic growth quickened in the third quarter as government and consumer spending rebounded, but exports were knocked by cooling global growth, a sign that more monetary easing may be required to sustain a fragile recovery.

Underscoring the tenuous economic momentum, the Bank of Korea said a large part of the consumption uptick was merely payback from a slump in the second quarter, when a ferry accident dented domestic travel and retail spending.

That took some of the shine off Friday's BOK data showing the economy grew a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent in July-September from the second quarter. It followed a 0.5 percent rise in the second quarter and matched the median 0.9 percent forecast in a Reuters survey of 21 analysts.

"(Third-quarter growth) was driven by domestic components, following weak readings in the previous quarter. But trade contracted and consumer confidence has not picked up meaningfully," said HSBC economist Ronald Man in a note.

"This suggests that policymakers in Korea will maintain an accommodative stance to support growth and we forecast the Bank of Korea to hold its policy rate at 2.00 percent over the foreseeable future."

Policymakers will be particularly concerned by data showing weaker sales abroad dampened spending on production equipment, suggesting a fragile economic recovery after growth slowed to its weakest pace in nearly two years in the June quarter.

"South Korea is doing relatively well compared to other countries but growth is not yet firm," said BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol during a meeting with local conglomerate CEOs on Friday.

"Despite questions on what may happen to household debt, we lowered rates because it was important we keep the spark of recovery alive."

The Bank of Korea has cut interest rates by 50 basis points to match a record-low 2.00 percent in two moves this year.

After the latest cut earlier this month, the central bank gave no clear signal that its easing cycle had ended, keeping the door open for another reduction.

GLOBAL HEADWINDS

The export-reliant economy, home to global titans such as the world's biggest smartphone maker, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , and car maker Hyundai Motor Co, has struggled since April from the effects of the ferry disaster and sluggish export growth.

On Thursday, Hyundai reported a 29 percent year-on-year fall in quarterly net profit, hit by a strong local currency and slowing sales in its key U.S. and South Korean markets.

While Asia's fourth-largest economy is seen to have passed a trough in the second quarter, analysts worry a tottering global economy could hamper the recovery.

Highlighting global uncertainties, Friday's data showed exports fell 2.6 percent from the previous three months, the first quarterly decline since the third quarter of 2013, when they dropped 1.1 percent.

A cooling Chinese economy and the threat of recession in Europe have raised doubts about global demand.

"As exports out of China weaken, our shipments are declining as well because South Korea mainly exports intermediate products to China," Jung Yung-taek, head of the central bank's statistics department, told reporters.

South Korea's manufacturing activity shrank in September to the lowest in three months as domestic and export demand cooled, a survey found earlier this month.

And industrial output in August had its worst monthly fall since the 2008 global financial crisis.

Despite cutting rates to shore up momentum, the full benefits of the BOK's monetary medicine won't be evident until the end of the fourth quarter, or early next year, due to the lagged transmission effects on the real economy.

A raft of new policies launched by Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan after he took office in July would also have provided only a modest boost to growth in the third quarter, as the bulk of the measures still need parliamentary approval.

From a year earlier, South Korea's gross domestic product rose 3.2 percent in the September quarter, below an expected 3.3 percent and slowing from a 3.5 percent increase in the second quarter.

The Bank of Korea estimated private consumption gained a seasonally adjusted 1.1 percent in the third quarter after a 0.3 percent decline in the second. Capital investment fell 0.8 percent, after a 1.1 percent rise in the second quarter.

Logitech Says Tablet Slowdown Won¡¦t Derail Its Turnaround; Peripherals Maker Reported Second-Quarter Net Profit More Than Doubled

ZURICH¡XLogitech International SA¡¦s turnaround won¡¦t be derailed by a slowdown in the tablet computer market, the company¡¦s chief executive said Thursday, even though the peripherals maker has hitched much of its revival to mobile computing devices.

On Wednesday, Logitech, based in Newark, Calif., and Lausanne, Switzerland, said its profit more than doubled during its second quarter, even though sales of tablet accessories, like detachable keyboards, fell 19% in the period amid a slowdown in tablet sales.

In an interview, Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said a slowdown in the tablet market wouldn¡¦t disrupt Logitech¡¦s growth. He said the company isn¡¦t dependent on one market, pointing to the success of a newly launched computer mouse designed for videogamers and mobile speakers.

¡§If tablets slow down, we have other growth areas,¡¨ said Mr. Darrell, adding that tablet accessory sales would likely pick up early next year as new products hit the market. ¡§We are not dependent on tablets or any one single platform to deliver our turnaround.¡¨

Logitech, the world¡¦s biggest maker of computer mouses, was caught flat-footed by the sudden rise of tablets and smartphones. Since taking over early last year, Mr. Darrell has pushed the company to have shorter design and production cycles so that its peripherals can be in stores shortly after the launch of new devices. Many of those are designed for popular tablet computers, like Apple Inc.¡¦s iPads and Samsung Electronics Co.¡¦s Galaxy tablets.

However, growth in tablet computer sales has slowed this year. Worldwide unit shipments are expected to grow 11% in 2014, a sharp deceleration from 55% growth in 2013, according to estimates by market researcher Gartner Inc.

Logitech has broadened its product range, launching a new gaming keyboard and mouse, a new wireless mouse and a multiple-device keyboard that can be used with tablets and smartphones. Mr. Darrell said new products would continue to be launched in the coming months, including products for Apple¡¦s new iPad.

On Thursday, Logitech indicated the strategy was paying off. Net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 increased 151% to $36.1 million from $14.4 million a year earlier. The result, driven by cost cuts and the absence of restructuring charges it faced last year, beat analysts¡¦ forecast of $23.4 million.

Sales fell slightly to $530.3 million from $532 million a year earlier, in line with forecasts of $530 million.

Logitech confirmed its guidance for full-year operating income to $170 million.

¡§The results show that Logitech is no longer dependent on one or two categories,¡¨ said Michael Foeth, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich. Mr. Foeth rates Logitech at buy.

During the period, Logitech¡¦s mobile speaker business was its star performer, posting triple-digit sales growth. The mobile speakers work with smartphones and tablet computers.

Logitech said an investigation of accounting matters related to previously issued financial statements is now closed. The company expects to file its reports as soon as possible with the SIX Swiss Exchange and Nasdaq, which carries its U.S. listing.

A Reason to Stress About Europe Banks

When everyone is staring in one direction, it often pays to look the other way.

European bank stocks have endured a wild ride as the Continent's "stress test" results near. The European Central Bank is due to release them Sunday. Greek, Portuguese and some Italian and Spanish banks have suffered especially.

That is understandable. There are plenty of questions about European banks' capital strength. And no one wants to own a bank that comes asking for more equity.

But too many banks have been tainted by this worry. So there is a good chance that solid, unloved institutions will rally once the uncertainty of the stress tests is past and investors can refocus on the ECB's stimulus efforts.

If, that is, the tests are credible. A lot rides on the stress tests for the ECB, which takes over eurozone bank supervision from national governments next month.

Its reputation will be based on its review of banks' books and the stress tests.

The last tests under the sole supervision of the European Banking Authority were risible; several banks passed only to require bailouts later.

Even with the ECB now at the helm, there is skepticism about how conclusive the tests will be. Europe, after all, has many competing voices and levels of economic health. Muddy political compromise is a near-inevitable outcome.

And the European tests can never draw the same bright line as did those in the U.S. in 2009. The ECB, for example, can tell a bank it must raise capital. But it can't promise that a government will inject some if the bank can't or won't.

However, because the last European tests didn't work and the ECB's own credibility rests on the new ones, there is a decent chance they will be good enough. While some banks will indeed fail, investors may find there is opportunity to be had in a glass-half-full approach.

As things now stand, banks such as ING Groep of the Netherlands and Credit Agricole or even BNP Paribas of France aren't valued as recovery stories with big gains due from once-bad assets. Nor are they shunned as weaklings or firms overburdened by regulatory fines to come.

ING has cleaned up its balance sheet, sold insurance businesses and is cutting funding costs. Credit Agricole has seen its capital base grow strongly, although a lot has come from investment gains in its insurance unit. BNP Paribas has yet to resolve a U.S. dollar-clearing ban that arose from its sanctions busting, but is performing well otherwise and should benefit from ECB monetary actions.

All three are valued at less than 0.9 times book value, while ING and BNP also have unchallenging forward price/earnings ratios of about 10 times. Credit Agricole trades at 11.5 times forward earnings, but has a lower book value multiple of 0.6 times.

A credible-enough stress-test result could see these kinds of banks rerated. If BNP's valuation moves up to the multiple of J.P. Morgan Chase's at about 0.94 times, for example, that would lift BNP's shares more than 30%.

Investors with a higher risk appetite also could look at weaker banks that might still pass, especially if hedge funds have bet heavily against those stocks. Their prices could leap if investors are forced to buy back stock to cover those short wagers.

Portugal's Banco Comercial Portugues and smaller Spanish banks like Sabadell and Banco Popular Espanol have heavy so-called short interest, according to data from Markit Group. Notably, the second-most-shorted bank stock in the Stoxx 600 is ING.

Beyond the stress tests, Europe still faces low economic growth and low interest rates, so it will be some time before banks see lending and interest-income growth. Then again, things have been so desperate that any signs of life would be good. And, should credible stress tests relieve capital concerns, European bank stocks will be looked at in a different way.

BOE's Gloomier Outlook

Challenges U.K. Debt Bet

A bet that yields on U.K. and German government bonds would diverge has been a profitable strategy as markets increasingly priced in a strong U.K. recovery versus a lackluster eurozone performance. The latest Bank of England minutes, published Wednesday, show why that wager may be running out of steam.

The trade has worked ever since September 2012, when yields on 10-year U.K. gilts and German bunds were virtually level at around 1.55%, according to FactSet data. Since then, bund yields have fallen to 0.84% while gilt yields have risen to 2.22%. Since bond yields and prices move in inverse relation, this means gilt prices have fallen while those of bunds have risen.

But recent market volatility has taken its toll. The gap between the benchmark instruments has tightened from its widest level above 1.5 percentage points in September, when gilt yields hit 2.57%.

And there is growing reason to believe that the yield gap will have a tough time widening as significantly again. Inflation in the U.K. declined unexpectedly to 1.2% in September, well below the BOE's 2% target. And while the U.K. economy is expected to continue to grow, the pace may slow somewhat.

The third-quarter reading for U.K. growth, due Friday, will be closely watched in this regard. It isn't clear how well the U.K. can withstand weak growth in Europe and emerging markets.

The latest BOE minutes underline this. True, two members of the Monetary Policy Committee, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, continued to vote for a 0.25-percentage-point rate increase. That was despite the fact the committee knew the low inflation number when it met.

But the other seven committee members seemed to be more concerned about global developments and a lack of domestic inflationary pressures. BOE chief economist Andrew Haldane last week noted that his view of the economy was "gloomier" than a few months ago. Wage inflation seems likely to be the key factor to watch. So far, it has been notable by its absence.

The somewhat weaker outlook for the U.K. is a problem for the gilt-bund trade. Set against that, the eurozone position looks much more worrying. The ECB is still under pressure to loosen policy further; the U.K., by contrast, is still looking at rate increases, albeit starting later than the market thought until recently.

So the yield gap could widen again. But the big money likely has been made on this trade already.

Samsung Finds Strength in Family

It is time to stop thinking of Samsung Electronics as a smartphone company.

Samsung's runaway success the past few years in smartphones had investors wondering if the South Korean giant could become the next Apple. That seems increasingly unlikely. But Samsung's leading position in less sexy chips, displays and other parts, plus its cheap valuation, still make it a company worth owning.

Samsung's mobile division, dominated by smartphones, brought in more than two-thirds of the company's operating profit last year, up from just around one-quarter in 2010. Yet that era of smartphone dominance was short-lived. The mobile division was likely the main culprit behind the company's forecast for a 60% decline in third-quarter operating profit. Shares are down nearly 20% this year.

There seems little prospect of a smartphone turnaround in the near future, given intense competition at the high end from Apple. At the low end is heat from Chinese handset makers.

The outlook is less gloomy for Samsung's components businesses. In memory chips, it is the leader in both technology and in terms of scale in an industry once riven by competition, but now consolidated to just a handful of profitable players.

The stock looks cheap at eight times forward earnings and 1.1 times book value, below the 10-year averages of 10 times earnings and 1.7 times book. Back out $44.4 billion of net cash, and it trades at just six times forward earnings.

Even assuming Samsung's mobile business is worthless, which it isn't, the stock looks undervalued. Putting the chip business at two times book value -- a discount to rivals, which trade at an average of nearly three times -- and adding Samsung's cash and investments, leaves a higher valuation than the current market capitalization, notes Mark Newman of Bernstein Research.

In fact, Samsung has been cheap, at around eight times earnings or below, since the middle of 2012, even before the smartphone business peaked. What is missing is a catalyst to unlock value.

Investors have agitated for the company to return more of its massive cash reserves to boost the stock. Samsung had hinted for months that it would unveil a detailed plan to send more cash to shareholders with its first-half results, only to backtrack in July, saying it needed more time.

This foot-dragging is partially explained by the stock's true problem: the convoluted structure through which the Lee family controls the broader Samsung empire. Since family patriarch Lee Kun-hee was hospitalized with a heart attack earlier this year, his children appear to have started work on an opaque plan to rearrange assets.

One likely objective is to consolidate control over crown jewel Samsung Electronics, in which Lee family members hold only a small direct stake. This means they would benefit little from a distribution of cash to shareholders before the reshuffle.

Similarly, Mr. Lee's heirs face a 50% inheritance tax on his stake in Samsung Electronics. There is little incentive for them to boost the share price beforehand.

Samsung's smartphone woes look set to continue. But bright prospects for its other business aren't reflected in the share price. For now, investors will have to wait for that value to be unlocked by the Lee family.

Gold and platinum are prized for their rarity. What is happening with their prices right now is also pretty unusual.

At about $1,245 an ounce, gold isn't far off parity with platinum at about $1,270. This doesn't happen often. In the past 20 years, gold has matched or exceeded the platinum price only about 7% of the time. And much of that occurred between the summer of 2011 and early 2013, when quantitative easing was in full swing and hyperbole about the dollar's demise was at its height.

Similarly, the current price action reflects an anxious world. Gold hasn't really gained much this year; rather, platinum has collapsed since July. This makes sense. as more than half of platinum demand relates to industrial, primarily, automotive uses. Deflation fears have hurthave industrial commodities.

Gold usually benefits when such extreme scenarios seem plausible. There is one twist: Negative inflation would imply rising real interest rates. The latter erode the case for holding nonyielding assets such as precious metals. Even so, the rare melding of gold and platinum prices is an unwelcome sign that optimism about growth is rapidly becoming the rarest commodity of all.

UPDATE 2-Hyundai Motor eyes dividend hike to soothe investors; shares surge

* Hyundai considers sharply raising dividend, weighs interim div (Recasts with president's comments on dividends, adds details)

By Hyunjoo Jin

SEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor is considering paying its first ever interim dividend next year, its president said on Thursday, in an apparent bid to appease investors angered by its involvement in a $10 billion purchase of a trophy property in Seoul.

The possibility of a larger payout, which President Lee Won-hee revealed as the company reported its third-quarter earnings, helped Hyundai Motor shares to post their biggest daily percentage gain in two-and-half years.

The company, which along with its affiliate Kia Motors Corp is the world's fifth largest automaker, had earlier posted a 29 percent drop in its third-quarter net profit, slightly below analysts' estimates.

"To respond to the government's policy and to have a shareholder friendly policy, we are considering expanding dividends significantly and paying out an interim dividend from next year," said Lee, who is also chief financial officer.

Dividend payouts in South Korea are among the lowest globally, and the government is considering taxes to change that.

Shareholders have punished Hyundai Motor since it and two sister companies bid $10 billion last month for a plot of land in Seoul's high-end Gangnam district to house a headquarters, theme park and shopping mall.

The cost of the deal, more than triple the appraised value of the property, and sparked worries about the family-run Hyundai Group's governance. The group's plans to fund it with cash also dented investors' hopes for higher dividends from its listed units.

"Today's announcement helped ease shareholder disappointment after the property deal," said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management, which holds Hyundai Motor shares.

"There is room for Hyundai to achieve further growth although rising competition, a weaker yen and slowdown in China, Hyundai's biggest market, remain major risks," he said.

Before the dividend announcement, Hyundai Motor's stock was down than 30 percent lower so far this year, making it the worst performer among its global peers.

Its shares ended up 5.9 percent on Thursday, a day after hitting their lowest levels in four years, partly due to investors concerns that its third-quarter profit may miss forecasts. It was the stock's biggest percentage gain since April 2012.

Hyundai is not alone in dangling the prospect of bigger payouts to ease shareholder pressure. In January, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, under pressure to appease investors who have berated it for hoarding the spoils of rapid growth, pledged to hand out even more profit after almost doubling its full-year dividend to a record $2 billion.

The company, however, in July kept its interim dividend unchanged from last year.

EARNINGS SEEN IMPROVING IN Q4

Hyundai has struggled with increasing competition at home and abroad, as well as a stronger local currency which has reduced the value of its repatriated overseas earnings.

Its revamped Sonata sedan, which the company had hoped would revive sluggish sales in the key U.S. and domestic markets, has been criticised as bland, especially compared to its predecessor.

Lee acknowledged the new Sonata had "not kicked off to a strong start" but said Hyundai expected to boost sales through word-of-mouth.

He also said the company plans to launch new models with improved fuel efficiency with next-generation engines and transmission.

Lee forecast fourth-quarter earnings would improve sharply, largely due to the won easing against the U.S. dollar and better sales performance of newer models. The South Korean won rose to its highest levels against the dollar since the 2008 global financial crisis in the third quarter, the company said.

BAKU, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan plans to complete the construction of a fertiliser plant with an annual capacity 700,000 tonnes of carbamide as well as chemical plants by the end of 2016, the head of Azerkhimia state company said.

Mukhtar Babayev told Reuters the carbamide plant would be ready for operation at the end of the first quarter of 2017.

He said the plant, costing around 500 million euros and to be financed from the state budget, would include sections for the production of carbamide, also known as urea, and ammonia.

"We will satisfy domestic demand in fertilisers and export to the countries of the region as well as to the world markets via Black Sea ports in Georgia," Babayev said.

Samsung Engineering is the general contractor for the project.

Azerbaijan was planning to build another fertiliser plant with the same capacity in neighbouring Georgia, but Babayev said the project was being reviewed and the final decision would be made later.

"Some corrections have been made and we are discussing details of this project," Babayev said.

He said that apart from the production of fertilisers, Azerbaijan planned to build facilities for production of polypropylene and polythene at a chemical industrial park in the city of Sumgait, some 19 miles outside the capital Baku.

The polypropylene plant, with an annual capacity of 150,000 tonnes, was expected to start production at the end of 2016, while the polythene plant, with an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes, would be ready in the beginning of 2017.

Azerkhimia, a part of Azeri state energy company SOCAR, produced 68,100 tonnes of polythene, 39,600 tonnes of polypropylene and other chemical products in the first nine months of this year. Total production of all chemical products rose to 271,896 tonnes in January-September from 231,524 tonnes in the same period last year.

The company exports its products via Georgian Black Sea port of Poti to neighbouring Turkey and Georgia, European countries as well as the United States and countries in Asia.

Huawei says third-quarter smartphone shipments jump 26 percent, strong demand for high-end devices

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd said third-quarter smartphone shipments jumped 26 percent year-on-year, doubling devices shipped to the high-margin premium market dominated by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc.

Shenzhen-based Huawei, the world's third-biggest smartphone supplier after the dominant pair, shipped 16.8 million smartphones globally in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to company data. About a quarter of those were mid- to high-end models, more than twice as many as the same period last year.

"We are breaking our bottlenecks of mid- to high-end models step by step, especially in overseas markets," Huawei consumer business group marketing executive Shao Yang told Reuters in an interview.

Huawei, like Chinese rivals Lenovo Group Ltd and ZTE Corp, is better known for selling low- and mid-priced handsets in emerging markets than high-end models in developed countries.

Industry watchers say that although Huawei's premium devices are cutting-edge, the company has struggled to break into the high-end sector markets like the United States due to a lack of brand recognition and security concerns. Huawei had 6.7 percent of the global smartphone market in the second quarter, a distant third behind Samsung Electronics and Apple, according to analysis firm IDC.

As if to prove a point, Huawei unveiled a smartphone with an advanced sapphire glass display just days before Apple released its highly anticipated iPhone 6 in September.

"We have never questioned our ability to make products, but sometimes we are worried if we could occupy a place emotionally in consumers' hearts. So we will try to achieve that next year," Shao said.

Huawei's global marketing budget would leap at least 30 percent in 2015, compared with $440 million this year, he said.

The company has shipped 51 million smartphones globally in the first three quarters of 2014 - about 63.8 percent of its annual shipment target of 80 million, according to Reuters' calculations, based on figures provided by Huawei.

Shao said he expected quarter-on-quarter shipments growth of up to 80 percent in the fourth quarter, a peak holiday season for smartphone vendors.

A little more than half of Huawei's smartphone shipments went to China in the third quarter. Elsewhere, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific recorded the strongest growth.

Hyundai Motor¡¦s Profit Skids; Korea Won¡¦s Strength Hurting Competitiveness

SEOUL¡XHyundai Motor Co.¡¦s third-quarter net profit fell 28%, hurt by a stronger local currency, work stoppages by unionized employees and weak local sales of its new flagship Sonata sedan.

¡§We expect uncertainty surrounding the auto market, including volatile foreign exchange rates, to continue for the time being. If the currency stabilizes, our earnings could improve in the fourth quarter, when we also plan some new-car launches,¡¨ the company said.

The world¡¦s fifth-biggest auto maker, when combined with affiliate Kia Motors Corp., has been struggling to compete with rivals as the stronger won, particularly against a weaker yen, has made its exports more expensive. Earlier this year Hyundai set its annual sales growth target at just 4%, its most conservative in over a decade.

The won is hovering around a six-year high against the yen, which has been depressed by Tokyo¡¦s ultra-easy monetary policy since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office. Against the dollar, the won was on average 7.6% stronger in the third quarter, compared with a year ago.

Japan and South Korea are major competitors in the global market for shipments of electronics, automobiles and other products, making the exchange rate between the two nations vital for companies like Hyundai Motor Co. and Samsung Electronics Co.

Hyundai said Thursday that its third-quarter net profit dropped to 1.62 trillion won ($1.53 billion) from 2.25 trillion won a year earlier.

Operating profit fell 18% from a year earlier to 1.65 trillion won, while revenue rose 2.2% to 21.28 trillion won.

Its bottom line was also hurt by union strikes.

Hyundai, which has one of the country¡¦s most militant labor groups, has been hit by strikes in all but four years of its union¡¦s nearly three decade history. Hyundai¡¦s 47,000 union members¡Xabout 80% of the firm¡¦s workforce¡Xhave held a series of stoppages from August this year.

Those strikes and similar labor actions at affiliate Kia. have led to lost production of more than 20,000 cars worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

More recently, Hyundai¡¦s workers downed their tools last month to protest a successful bid by the company and its two affiliates to buy a plot of land in southern Seoul for $10 billion¡Xmore than three times its appraised value. The winning bid sent the company¡¦s into a sharp decline, and they briefly traded at a four-year low of 157,500 won on Wednesday.

After the earnings announcement, Hyundai¡¦s stock surged 5.9% to end Thursday at 171,000 won, as Hyundai executives said fourth-quarter profits are expected to improve because the won¡¦s strengthening has slowed.

Also, Lee Won-hee, the company¡¦s chief financial officer, said it plans to increase dividend payments and is also considering an interim dividend from next year, to enhance shareholder value.

Still, Hyundai faces growing challenges as foreign rivals encroach on its home turf.

Free-trade deals that have halved tariffs on foreign cars in South Korea helped lift imported auto sales to nearly 15% of total sales so far this year, from below 2% a decade ago.

As part of its efforts to attract customers, Hyundai launched its revamped flagship midsize sedan, called the Sonata, in April.

Sales of the new Sonata, however, nearly halved in September from 11,904 in April as drivers increasingly favor sport-utility vehicles.

(Adds further earnings figures, context, shares)

* Q3 operating profit jumps 11.7 pct, matches forecasts

* SK Hynix says revenue up for all product groups

* Smartphones, PCs boost sales

SEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - SK Hynix Inc, the world's second-biggest memory chip maker, reported record quarterly profit for the July-September period as the launch of new smartphones and steady demand from the personal computer sector boosted earnings.

The firm said shipments of DRAM chips used mainly in personal computers rose 7 percent from the previous period, while its average selling price held steady. Shipments for NAND chips used mainly in mobile devices climbed 26 percent although their average price fell 2 percent.

Memory chip makers have enjoyed strong profits so far this year thanks to better-than-expected demand for personal computers and servers as well as to careful capacity management.

The South Korean firm, which competes with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Micron Technology Inc, reported an operating profit of 1.3 trillion won ($1.24 billion), matching the mean forecast from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of 36 analysts.

Revenue grew 5.6 percent from a year earlier to 4.3 trillion won, also a quarterly record with growth in every product group.

Samsung's plan to invest nearly $15 billion in a new South Korean chip plant has sparked worries about a price war, although analysts say the facility probably will not impact global supply until 2017.

Samsung Chief Executive Kwon Oh-hyun told reporters earlier this month he did not expect a price war to break out next year, supporting a widely held belief that memory market conditions will remain healthy until at least 2015.

Market researcher DRAMeXchange said that average contract prices for 4-gigabyte DRAM chips rose by 2.34 percent in the first half of October and that additional price increases were likely due to strong demand for mobile phones and servers.

Rival Micron late last month reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal fourth quarter.

SK Hynix shares were up 0.1 percent after the earnings release, compared with a 0.2 percent rise in the benchmark Kospi share index (1 US dollar = 1,052.4600 Korean won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)

Corporate News: At Sony, Hopes Dim For Its Smartphones

TOKYO -- Sony Corp. is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, as the business struggles in the face of fierce competition -- especially in emerging markets.

The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43 million for the 12 months ending March 2015, those people said. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50 million, which many analysts said at the time was too optimistic.

The expected revision stems from Sony's plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets.

Sony disappointed investors in September when it announced it would write down 180 billion yen ($1.68 billion) of the smartphone segment's business value and forecast a 230 billion yen net loss for the current business year -- almost five times what it previously expected.

For Sony watchers, the latest plan won't come as much of a surprise, as company executives, including Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, have signaled a downsizing of the smartphone business in some countries after concluding that introducing entry-level models for emerging markets was a mistake. Sony plans to hold a meeting with investors in November, and Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said details of how it will update the smartphone business plan would be unveiled there.

Sony's Xperia smartphone business was once a star player for the company, but is now experiencing trouble. It has been hit by the emergence of Chinese makers of cheap handsets, while it continues to struggle in competition against market leaders Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.

The Xperia will remain a core business for the company along with image sensors and the gaming business, but Mr. Yoshida has said at news conferences that the smartphone segment will focus on high-end models and won't seek a major share of the global market.

Mr. Hirai said in September that Sony would cut 1,000 jobs, or 15% of its global smartphone business workforce, by March. Some analysts said the cuts weren't enough to turn around the segment.

Sony is to announce its results for the July-September period on Oct. 31. While analysts expect a net loss due to the 180 billion yen smartphone charges, they say it is unlikely the company would again revise its earnings forecast lower for the year.

New York hedge-fund firm Third Point LLC, which unsuccessfully sought a partial spinoff of Sony's entertainment business, said Tuesday said that it had sold its stake in Sony for a return of nearly 20%, saying in a letter to its investors that "more urgency" was necessary to "definitively turn around the company's fortunes."

Samsung Electronics Finds

Strength in Product Family

It is time to stop thinking of Samsung Electronics as a smartphone company.

Samsung's runaway success the past few years in smartphones had investors wondering if the South Korean giant could become the next Apple. That seems increasingly unlikely. But Samsung's leading position in less sexy chips, displays and other parts, plus its cheap valuation, still make it a company worth owning.

Shares are down nearly 20% this year.

There seems little prospect of a smartphone turnaround in the near future, given intense competition at the high end from Apple. At the low end is heat from Chinese handset makers that rely on the same Android operating system Samsung uses.

The outlook is less gloomy for Samsung's components businesses. In memory chips, it is the leader in both technology and in terms of scale in an industry once riven by competition, but now consolidated to just a handful of profitable players.

In logic chips, Samsung lost a major customer when Apple switched over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for its iPhones. But Samsung is ahead of TSMC in the next generation of smaller-transistor chips, and analysts predict it will win back some Apple orders next year. Similarly in displays, Samsung is at the technological forefront with organic light-emitting diode technology.

The stock looks cheap at eight times forward earnings and 1.1 times book value, below the 10-year averages of 10 times earnings and 1.7 times book. Back out $44.4 billion of net cash, and it trades at just six times forward earnings.

Even assuming Samsung's mobile business is worthless, which it isn't, the stock looks undervalued. Putting the chip business at two times book value -- a discount to rivals, which trade at an average of nearly three times -- and adding Samsung's cash and investments, leaves a higher valuation than the current market capitalization, notes Mark Newman of Bernstein Research.

Yahoo reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday. Revenue rose 1% versus a year earlier. That is paltry for a tech company but still better than year-over-year declines seen in some recent quarters.

Notably, the company broke out its mobile revenue for the first time, saying it came in at $200 million in the quarter. It also forecast gross mobile revenue of $1.2 billion this year.

That is a major shift. And Yahoo said mobile, social, native and video ads rose a combined 80% year over year. The gains appear to be helping offset declines in Yahoo's traditional display-ad business.

Yet they also may raise eyebrows. Yahoo offered few details on how it accomplished such a sizable swing. The company previously had declined to break out mobile revenue, saying it wasn't material to results.

As well, Yahoo's $1.2 billion forecast amounts to nearly 28% of analysts' consensus estimates for 2014 revenue. That seems to require Yahoo to shift revenue to mobile at an even faster pace in the fourth quarter.

Perhaps more important, Yahoo gave few answers on how it planned to use the net $6.3 billion in cash it got from selling shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding when that company went public last month. Instead, Ms. Mayer defended her acquisition track record and highlighted the $7.7 billion in shares Yahoo has bought back during her tenure.

Yahoo also kicked the can down the road on its strategy for reducing the tax bill on the stakes of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan it continues to own.

Things at Yahoo don't seem to be getting worse. But it is too soon to call them better.

Recent years haven't been kind to stock analysts. Fair-disclosure rules led investors to see less value in Wall Street research. Regulatory scrutiny gave firms more reason to rethink research. From 2000 to 2008, 43 brokers closed research departments. But for chief executives and other corporate insiders looking to trade their companies' shares, this was a boon, suggests research from Wei Wu, a graduate student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Mr. Wu looked at trading behavior of insiders at companies with five or fewer analysts when, as a result of research-department closures, coverage was reduced. He found for each analyst a company lost, returns reaped by insiders increased. Mr. Wu's favored explanation: Important information that would otherwise have been transmitted to investors was lost, increasing trading opportunities for insiders.

Another possibility is that with fewer analysts monitoring the company, insiders felt they had a freer hand to trade.

World News: Asia: Indonesia President Turns to Economy

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Joko Widodo is the first entrepreneur to become president of Indonesia, and his supporters hope his history of pragmatism and disdain for red tape will help him modernize the country's economy.

But standing in the way of change is a system of entrenched interests, corruption and growing economic nationalism that has limited growth, discouraged foreign investment and left Southeast Asia's largest economy in the bottom half of World Bank rankings for ease of doing business.

Mr. Widodo, a former furniture exporter, has yet to lay out specific economic plans.

"To be honest," one of his close advisers said, speaking of his economic policies, "none of us know."

However, there are clues that beneath his action-oriented surface he supports a conventional Indonesian government view of the world that shuns imports, favors state-owned enterprises and restricts foreign activity.

"The prevailing wind in Indonesia is blowing in the direction of reduced foreign involvement in the economy," said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC. "There is a risk that President Widodo follows the more restrictive trend set by his predecessor."

Indonesian politicians have long suggested that foreigners get too good a deal. In recent years, Indonesia has introduced new limits on foreign investment, including declaring oil-and-gas services off limits, restricting foreign employment, forcing many foreign miners to reduce stakes in their companies, and introducing new requirements for local product sourcing. Mining came to a near-standstill this year when the government banned the export of minerals that hadn't been fully refined in an attempt to force investment in refineries.

Foreign investment has slowed over the past year and while it remains at record levels for Indonesia, it remains proportionally far less than in neighboring developing countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, and even less than in similar large developing countries with their own nationalist history, such as Brazil.

Mr. Widodo needs more foreign investment to fund infrastructure that is breaking at the seams and to plug gaps in the country's accounts -- all the more important with economic growth near its lowest level in four years.

But Mr. Widodo hasn't publicly made that argument, or any case against the economic thinking that dogs the near-trillion-dollar economy. His infrastructure plans so far target developing more deep-sea ports around the country to spread the benefits of growth to poorer regions.

On balance, said Doug Ramage, Jakarta-based analyst for BowerGroupAsia, the president's "pragmatism shines through," and his stated intent to simplify a complex system of regulations and clean up the bureaucracy would help local and foreign businesses alike. But "he has not yet pushed back strongly against the economic nationalism that will hold Indonesia back."

Companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd., or Foxconn, have repeatedly passed on Indonesia as a site of major manufacturing, citing difficulties in negotiating land acquisition and tax holidays, among other issues. And at a time when companies are exiting China because of higher labor costs, Vietnam, which in proportional terms attracts more than the double Indonesia's FDI, is emerging as the regional winner.

Mr. Widodo has repeated common refrains that the nation of 250 million people needs higher growth, better infrastructure and added value across sectors. "Investors usually complain about four things," he said Monday after his inauguration. "Fuel subsidies, infrastructure, bureaucratic reform and electricity. That's it."

During presidential debates, Mr. Widodo said he would honor the sanctity of contracts, key for the foreign energy and extractive companies that have spent tens of billions of dollars for decades developing Indonesia's natural resources such as oil, gas and mineral deposits. He said that upon expiration, he would consider letting state-owned companies take them over.

Mr. Widodo has repeatedly told businesspeople that Indonesia isn't ready to compete internationally. In a debate, he said that once a Southeast Asian regional free-trade pact takes force next year, the government could still introduce measures to make things "a little difficult" for foreign investors.

Mr. Widodo has suggested that the country imports too much and that he would push efforts to develop local car and defense industries, dreams that go back at least to the former authoritarian ruler Suharto, who was deposed in 1998.

He argues that Indonesia needs to become self-sufficient in agriculture, though such policies introduced by previous leaders have led to price spikes and corruption-inducing quotas on beef and other foodstuffs to protect the development of local agriculture.

Agricultural self-sufficiency, OCBC economist Wellian Wiranto said, "can potentially be read as another area of resource nationalism."

Mr. Widodo has said he intends to appoint nonpartisan professionals in key ministries and has stated he will cut billions of dollars in fuel subsidies that leave little budget left to fund infrastructure development.

"Our sense is that this administration realizes the immediate and long-term challenges it faces to keep the economy growing," said Andrew White, managing director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia.

iPad Air 2 Review: The Best Tablet Needs to Work Harder; It Has a Quality Screen and Build but It Needs to Go Beyond One-App-at-a-Time Functionality

When Steve Jobs plopped down on the couch, minutes after showing off the iPad for the first time, he said, ¡§It¡¦s so much more intimate than a laptop and so much more capable than a smartphone.¡¨

Four years later, as I watch the YouTube video of the iPad¡¦s debut keynote on the incredibly thin iPad Air 2, that sentence makes my brain ache. Laptops now have touch screens, smartphones are huge and powerful, and tablets now have keyboards. At least, those tablets made by the competition.

Apple¡¦s newest tablet, which goes on sale this week starting at $499, remains true to Jobs¡¦s tablet ideals. It¡¦s the best tablet you can buy¡Xespecially if you want to read headlines on the morning commute, watch ¡§Frozen¡¨ in the back seat and create intricate ¡§Minecraft¡¨ metropolises after dark. If you¡¦ve been waiting to replace an older iPad, now¡¦s the time.

But as I hold the thin piece of glass that would have been unimaginable five years ago, I look over at the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and feel like I am missing something. How this iPad stacks up depends entirely on where you plan to take it¡Xand what you want to do with it.

Home Alone

There¡¦s still no tablet I¡¦d rather cozy up with in bed or on the couch. In those situations, the 6.1mm Air 2 really lives up to its name.

No, we aren¡¦t at the point where it feels like you¡¦re holding a feather, but there is a substantial difference between grasping the 0.96-pound Air 2 and any of the earlier iPads with one hand. I even noticed a difference between it and last year¡¦s original Air. Apple has squeezed down the svelte case so much that it feels as if you¡¦re holding nothing but a screen.

The iPad Air 2 is also far more manageable than Samsung¡¦s Galaxy Tab S 10.5, and its premium aluminum build and soft curved edges top Samsung¡¦s slimy, dimpled plastic cover.

With the lightweight Air 2, you¡¦re more likely to avoid that always painful iPad-on-the-face-fall when you nod off to sleep on the couch. Still, in most situations the smaller iPad Mini is less cumbersome to hold up.

For the things I do when I¡¦ve got my feet up (read long articles I¡¦ve saved in Pocket, sift through Twitter, watch back-to-back episodes of ¡§How I Met Your Mother¡¨), the iPad still beats the competition. The apps are better and more numerous, and they look great on the Retina display.

And shopping online can only get better with the iPad Air 2¡¦s new Touch ID sensor, as soon as more places allow you to use a finger scan instead of a password or credit-card number. And why hasn¡¦t Apple used Touch ID to create multiple iPad user accounts, since the tablet is so often shared among family members?

The Great Outdoors

The new Air¡¦s display addresses one of my biggest complaints about previous iPads: You can finally see the screen outdoors. A thinner display with an anti-reflective layer means unless the sun is really beating down, there¡¦s no need to pitch a towel tent over the screen while sitting by the pool. (Unfortunately, the new iPad Mini 3 doesn¡¦t have the improved screen.)

In my outdoor test, the Air 2 beat last year¡¦s Air, Samsung¡¦s Tab S and Amazon¡¦s previous Fire HDX, displaying a more even balance under both sunlight and shade. Outdoors, it only loses to a bona fide e-reader like the Kindle Paperwhite. But you¡¦ll still have to crank the brightness all the way up to see the screen in the sun, which will run down the battery faster.

That anti-reflective screen also makes a great, though admittedly ginormous, viewfinder for snapping nature shots with the revamped 8-megapixel camera. It takes much crisper shots than before, and in many cases, ones as good as those I can take with my iPhone 6. But I won¡¦t bring my iPad to some mountain peak, as some Apple promo shots suggest. My phone¡¦s camera is the fastest one for me to grab. And it has a flash for low-light situations and took clearer photos of a speedy pig I met in a New York City park. (Relax, it was on a leash.)

Besides, when I set the iPad Air 2 down for a second on a bench, it slid off and hit concrete, shattering the screen. Sure, I¡¦m to blame, but if Apple wants me to climb every mountain armed with nothing but an iPad, ruggedness should be as important as anti-reflectivity.

Planes, Trains and Automobiles

For commuters and travelers, the good news is the Air 2, despite being 18% thinner than the previous Air, still manages to deliver 10 hours of battery life. I didn¡¦t even take the charger out of the box until after I used the tablet for an entire cross-country flight and then a nonstop morning of checking email and writing.

Battery-wise, when it comes to streaming video, the Air 2 and its greatest Samsung rival are pretty evenly matched. At max brightness¡Xwhere the Air 2¡¦s screen is brighter than the 10.5-inch Galaxy Tab S¡Xthe Samsung lasted nine hours where the iPad ran only six. However, when I set the brightness to 50%, the iPad pulled ahead of the Galaxy. (I recommend using auto brightness unless you really need to step it up.)

Improved wireless connectivity is another boon for road warriors. The Air 2 has a faster wireless chip, which, in my testing, loaded Web pages a hair quicker than its predecessor. The cellular model (which, as usual, costs $130 more than its Wi-Fi counterpart, but has dramatically improved 4G LTE) is pre-installed with an Apple SIM that makes it easier to switch service providers, both domestically and abroad. It should be easier for you to use T-Mobile here in the U.S., then buy some gigabytes on the U.K. wireless carrier EE if you happen to be visiting London.

Career Opportunities

If you¡¦re like me, though, you¡¦ll still lug your laptop on business trips. Even as a basic work companion, the Air 2 doesn¡¦t do nearly enough to keep up with the latest competition.

The new A8X processor provides a performance boost, so the iOS 8 operating system and immersive full-screen apps respond to taps and swipes faster. And while iPad apps in general are superior to the stretched phone apps you too often see on Android tablets, I wish I could see more apps on the screen at the same time, the way I can with a Surface or Galaxy Tab.

I constantly yearned for that functionality while responding to emails about potential meeting times, tapping the home button frenetically to switch to the calendar. I yearned for it as I wrote this column, jumping to the messaging app to update my editor on my progress. I even yearned for it when I wasn¡¦t anywhere near my desk, surfing the Web and attempting to tweet an article.

I¡¦d also really love a better way to type. While I¡¦ve gotten faster on Apple¡¦s latest software keyboard (predictive QuickType helps), I¡¦m far more productive typing on real keys. Microsoft¡¦s $80 Universal Mobile Keyboard is one of the best you can buy, but it won¡¦t prop up the screen well enough¡Xand doesn¡¦t double as a cover.

The iPad Air 2 pushes forward in all the ways you¡¦d expect Apple¡¦s tablet to. The blend of screen, build and app quality make it the best full-size tablet you can buy.

But it doesn¡¦t move ahead in one area where some of us have been waiting (desperately) for evolution: true multi-tasking, going beyond the one-app-at-a-time functionality. Perhaps that¡¦s the big surprise that Apple will bring when it introduces a 12.9-inch iPad next year.

It would be nice to see the iPad get beyond the lean-back experience that¡¦s been the focus since Steve Jobs first sat down on the couch.

Samsung Finds Strength in Family of Products; Electronics Company Leads in Areas Such as Chips and Displays; Valuation Is Inexpensive

It is time to stop thinking of Samsung Electronics as a smartphone company.

Samsung¡¦s runaway success the past few years in smartphones had investors wondering if the South Korean giant could become the next Apple. That seems increasingly unlikely. But Samsung¡¦s leading position in less sexy chips, displays and other parts, plus its cheap valuation, still make it a company worth owning.

Samsung¡¦s mobile division, dominated by smartphones, brought in more than two-thirds of the company¡¦s operating profit last year, up from just around a quarter in 2010. Yet that era of smartphone dominance was short lived. The mobile division was likely the main culprit behind the company¡¦s forecast for a 60% decline in third-quarter operating profit. Shares are down nearly 20% this year.

There seems little prospect of a smartphone turnaround in the near future, given intense competition at the high end from Apple. At the low end is heat from Chinese handset makers who rely on the same Android operating system Samsung uses.

The outlook is less gloomy for Samsung¡¦s components businesses. In memory chips, it is the leader in both technology and in terms of scale in an industry once riven by competition, but now consolidated to just a handful of profitable players.

In logic chips, Samsung lost a major customer when Apple switched over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for its iPhones. But Samsung is ahead of TSMC in the next generation of smaller-transistor chips, and analysts predict it will win back some Apple orders next year. Similarly in displays, Samsung is at the technological forefront with organic light-emitting diode technology.

The stock looks cheap at eight times forward earnings and 1.1 times book value, below the 10-year averages of 10 times earnings and 1.7 times book. Back out $44.4 billion of net cash, and it trades at just six times forward earnings.

Even assuming Samsung¡¦s mobile business is worthless, which it isn¡¦t, the stock looks undervalued. Putting the chip business at two times book value¡Xa discount to rivals, who trade at an average of nearly three times¡Xand adding Samsung¡¦s cash and investments, leaves a higher valuation than the current market capitalization, notes Mark Newman of Bernstein Research.

In fact, Samsung has been cheap, at around eight times earnings or below, since the middle of 2012, even before the smartphone business peaked. What is missing is a catalyst to unlock value.

Investors have agitated for the company to return more of its massive cash reserves to boost the stock. Samsung had hinted for months that it would unveil a detailed plan to send more cash to shareholders with its first-half results, only to backtrack in July, saying it needed more time.

This foot-dragging is partially explained by the stock¡¦s true problem: the convoluted structure through which the Lee family controls the broader Samsung empire. Since family patriarch Lee Kun-hee was hospitalized with a heart attack earlier this year, his children appear to have started work on an opaque plan to rearrange assets.

One likely objective is to consolidate control over crown jewel Samsung Electronics, in which Lee family members hold only a small direct stake. This means they would benefit little from a distribution of cash to shareholders before the reshuffle. Similarly, Mr. Lee¡¦s heirs face a 50% inheritance tax on his stake in Electronics. There is little incentive for them to boost the share price beforehand.

Samsung¡¦s smartphone woes look set to continue. But bright prospects for its other business aren¡¦t reflected in the share price. For now, investors will have to wait for that value to be unlocked by the Lee family.

* Q3 revenue rises 6.4 pct

* Revenue boosted in part by iPhone 6 launch- Analysts

* Laird says expectations for full year unchanged

* Shares rise as much as 4.4 pct (Adds analyst comments, details, share movement)

Oct 22 (Reuters) - Laird Plc, a British electronic components maker, said third-quarter revenue rose 6.4 percent, driven by increased business from customers launching new products, selling more smartphones and investing in 4G LTE networks.

The company's shares rose as much as 4.5 percent to rank among the top percentage gainers on the FTSE 250 index on Wednesday morning.

Laird, whose customers include Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, said trading was in line and its expectations for the full year remained unchanged.

Revenue in the quarter rose to 150 million pounds from 141 million pounds a year earlier.

The revenue boost was mainly due to growth at its performance materials division, which makes products to ward off electromagnetic interference, manage heat dissipation and maintain signal quality in mobile phones and other electronics.

The division gained from Apple's iPhone 6 launch, share gains at Samsung and continued investment in LTE in China, Liberum analysts wrote in a note to clients.

Revenue from the business rose 8 percent to 101 million pounds, while Laird's wireless systems division, which makes antennas and remote control systems, saw a 3 percent rise in revenue.

Laird, which also makes smart chips for GPS and radio systems in cars, said the rise in wireless revenue was in part due to increased demand for its telematics products from the automotive market, particularly in North America.

The smaller signal-integrity business declined from a year earlier when the Xbox gaming console sales peaked, Liberum analysts said.

HitachiMaxell cuts profit forecast, reduces headcount in battery unit

TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Hitachi Maxell Ltd cut its annual operating profit forecast by 40 percent to 5.1 billion yen ($48 million) on Wednesday and said it would reduce headcount in its lithium ion battery business after high-end smartphone sales sagged.               

The Japanese electronics maker, which supplies lithium ion batteries for Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's  smartphones, said it would offer voluntary retirement packages to 130 staff over 40-years old at the end of Feb 2015 and outsource an increased proportion of batteries after that.               

Samsung's July-September profit was the lowest in more than three years and the company said in early October that short-term prospects for its smartphones remained uncertain, as its sales are undercut by Chinese makers at the low end of the market and squeezed at the high end by Apple Inc.               

HitachiMaxell company left its net profit outlook at 6.75 billion yen and said it would pay a dividend of 31.5 yen for the first half after previously leaving the amount unclear. It also cut its full-year forecast by 7.8 percent to 154 billion yen.               

The company's shares closed 2.2 percent higher at 1,726 yen,  a level that was 16.6 percent lower than its offering price when it relisted in March. HitachiMaxell was spun off from Hitachi Ltd after becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2010.

(Adds item on Apollo Global)               

Oct 22 (Reuters) - The following corporate finance-related stories were reported by media:               

* The European Central Bank is considering buying corporate bonds on the secondary market and may decide on the matter as soon as December with a view to begin purchases early next year, several sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.                              

* Spain's oil company Repsol has been awarded with a tender to buy 1.4 million barrels of vacuum gasoil (VGO) from state-run Petroecuador with deliveries starting the first week of November, traders told Reuters on Tuesday.                              

* German engineering group Siemens is in advanced talks to sell its hearing-aids business for more than 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), with private equity firm EQT the frontrunner, two people familiar with the matter said.                              

* Investment firm Strategic Value Partners (SVP) has again cancelled the sale of German packaging maker Kloeckner Pentaplast after receiving offers well below its asking price of 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion), several people familiar with the matter said.                              

* Australian investment bank Macquarie Group has bought Deutsche Bank's uranium book, a source familiar with the matter said, as the increasingly commodities-focused lender pushes deeper into global energy trading.                              

* German vehicles group Daimler is in advanced talks to take a minority stake in Italian motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta, a source in Italy familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.                              

* Cheil Industries Inc, the de facto holding company for Samsung Group, plans for its IPO to be worth between 1.3 trillion won and 1.5 trillion won ($1.2 billion to $1.4 billion), a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.                              

* Data storage products maker EMC Corp is buying much of Cisco System Inc's stake in their joint venture VCE, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

* Advance estimate due at 8 a.m., Oct 24 (2300 GMT, Oct 23)
    * Reuters poll: Q3 GDP +0.9 pct q/q, +3.3 pct y/y
    * Economy recovering from Q2 shocks on consumption, trade
    * Pace of economic improvement still weak, but steady

    SEOUL, Oct 22 (Reuters) - South Korea's economy is expected
to have rebounded modestly in the July-September quarter after
slowing sharply in the previous three months, a Reuters survey
showed, but cooling global growth is expected to keep the door
open for further monetary policy easing.
    The economy probably grew 0.9 percent in the third quarter
from the second on a seasonally adjusted basis, thanks to
exports growth and an uptick in private consumption, picking up
from a 0.5 percent rise in the June quarter, according to 22
analysts surveyed in the Reuters poll. 
    Second-quarter growth was the weakest in nearly two years
while the economy expanded 0.9 percent in the first three months
of the year.
    Analysts say the second quarter likely marked a trough for
the South Korean economy, as an April ferry sinking left
hundreds dead and hit private consumption as the public eschewed
domestic travel and scaled back on spending.
    "After the Sewol sinking, demand has been improving although
at a slow pace. Capital investment, however, is what likely
hindered third-quarter growth the most as corporate sentiment
still remains weak," said Kim Hwan, an economist at NH
Investment & Securities.
    Some economists say another rate cut cannot be ruled out as
the outlook remains uncertain, highlighted by renewed tumult in
global financial markets on worries about slowing global growth.
 A cooling Chinese economy and the threat of recession in Europe
have raised doubts about global demand.
    "Further cuts are only possible if exports weaken or the
stock market derails from financial instability stemming from
U.S. monetary policy tightening," said Kim Jong-su, an economist
at Taurus Investment & Securities.
    "Domestic demand, however, is coming up from terrible levels
seen in the second quarter and will not worsen."
    Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said this week that
downside risks remain even to its downgraded forecast. The bank
has cut interest rates by 50 basis points in two moves this year
in order to boost growth momentum. 
    Exports were probably the saving grace for third quarter
growth as shipments rose 3.9 percent on an annual basis, which
was the fastest pace since a 4.7 percent rise in the fourth
quarter of last year.
    The economy also got a boost from the inauguration in July
of a new finance minister, who launched a series of measures to
prop up growth.
    On an annual basis, Asia's fourth-largest economy probably
expanded by 3.3 percent in the third quarter of the year, the
Reuters poll showed.
    Still, the central bank says the recovery is slower than
anticipated, and downgraded its growth forecast for this year
earlier in October to 3.5 percent from 3.8 percent, citing
weaker-than-expected improvement in the third quarter.

GT ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

Agreement With Apple

allows Sale of Furnaces

GT Advanced Technologies has signed a pact with Apple Inc. for an "amicable parting of the ways," Luc Despins, attorney for the bankrupt supplier to the technology giant, said Tuesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Hampshire.

Apple was involved in a $578 million financing arrangement that set GT Advanced up in the business of making the synthetic sapphire-screen material. Instead of GT Advanced's sapphire, Apple sent the new generation of iPhones out with screens made from a Corning Inc. material.

Mr. Despins said the proposed settlement allows GT Advanced to try to sell the furnaces at the Mesa, Ariz. sapphire-manufacturing facility, and give the money to Apple, which financed the equipment. GT Advanced would surrender its claims against Apple, under the deal, and agree not to disparage the technology giant, he said.

Mr. Despins said GT Advanced and Apple have agreed to file a revised explanation for GT Advanced's surprise bankruptcy filing as part of the pact, and ultimately erase from the public record the court papers that set out what went wrong in the relationship between the two companies.

An Apple representative couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Apple has filed papers under seal in the case.

EMC

Cisco to Sell Portion

Of Stake in VCE Venture

EMC Corp. plans to buy a portion of Cisco Systems Inc.'s stake in a joint venture company called VCE that sells computing gear to corporate customers, people familiar with the matter said.

EMC will pay Cisco a "de minimus" amount for the portion of its stake, one person said. Spokesmen for EMC and Cisco declined to comment.

EMC posted an alert Tuesday stating it would hold a call with news media Wednesday morning to discuss a "new business development."

VCE, an acronym that stands for virtual computing environment, was established in 2009 with investors that also included VMware Inc. and Intel Corp.

Bloomberg reported news of the transaction between EMC and Cisco earlier Tuesday.

SAMSUNG

NSA Approves Some

Mobile Devices

Samsung Electronics Co. said the U.S. National Security Agency approved several of its mobile devices for use by government officials to carry classified information, a positive step for the smartphone maker's struggling mobile division.

The development comes as Samsung continues to work slowly but persistently to boost its appeal in the enterprise market by clearing the technological hurdles to ready Galaxy devices for corporate and government customers with high-security needs.

Samsung said on Tuesday that the NSA approved the Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note 3 smartphones and the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, among others, for use. On the same list of approved devices is Boeing Co.'s Boeing Black phone.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON

Improved Sales Don't Rev

Up Profit for Bike maker

Harley-Davidson Inc. reported strong retail sales of its motorcycles and better-than-expected profit for the third quarter. World-wide retail sales at Harley dealers in the latest quarter grew 3.8% from a year earlier.

Despite the improved retail sales, Harley's profit fell 7.8% in the third quarter to $150.1 million, or 69 cents a share, down from $162.7 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue, including financial services, slipped 3.1% to $1.30 billion.

* Won up on exporters, offshore funds
    * Rupiah eases on importers, traders book profits

 (Adds text, updates prices)
    By Jongwoo Cheon
    SINGAPORE, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Most emerging Asian currencies
edged up on Wednesday as regional stocks advanced and sentiment
improved, with the European Central Bank seen readying to launch
its plan to buy corporate bonds.
    South Korea's won gained on demand from exporters
for month-end settlements and as some offshore funds bought the
currency.
    Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose
nearly 1 percent, tracking higher U.S. stocks after
stronger-than-expected earnings from Apple Inc and
Texas Instruments Inc.
    Risk appetite improved as the ECB is considering buying
corporate bonds on the secondary market and may decide on the
matter as soon as December, several sources told Reuters.
 
    Emerging Asian currencies, however, failed to fully benefit
from strong equity performances and the ECB's stimulus plan as
the dollar broadly rose against a basket of major
currencies.
    "Any rebound in Asian currencies is unlikely to last long,"
said Jeong My-young, Samsung Futures' research head in Seoul.
    "Given differentials in economic fundamentals and interest
rates, the dollar's strong trend will sustain."
    
    RUPIAH
    The rupiah eased on dollar demand from importers for
month-end payments.
    Traders booked profits from gains in the currency, which on
Tuesday hit its strongest in about four weeks.
    The official Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR),
which the central bank launched last year in an effort to manage
exchange rate fluctuations, was fixed at 12,026 rupiah per
dollar, weaker than Tuesday's 11,993.

South Korean firms, unfazed by slowing economy, step up China investment

By Kazunori Takada and Sohee Kim

SHANGHAI/SEOUL, Oct 22 (Reuters) - South Korean firms have accelerated investment into China by a third this year, encouraged by improving diplomatic ties including a pending free trade deal.               

This expansion in China by South Korean companies is in sharp contrast to Japanese firms, which have been rapidly scaling back investment following a territorial dispute between Tokyo and Beijing two years ago and ongoing political spats.               

Japan's foreign direct investment into China is 43 percent lower so far this year from 2013 at $3.39 billion, while South Korea's FDI into China jumped 33 percent during the first nine months of the year to $3.23 billion.               

The South Korean investment surge comes as Beijing and Seoul strengthen diplomatic ties, hoping to wrap up free trade talks by year-end. Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Park Geun-hye have met five times since both took office last year and will hold another bilateral summit next month on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Beijing.               

In contrast, Xi has yet to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe since both took power.               

Heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and Kia Motors Corp have powered the investment drive by expanding production facilities in China, with manufacturing accounting for about 90 percent of total South Korean FDI to China.               

But investment in the less capital-intensive wholesale/retail sector grew over 55 percent last year as consumer goods firms cashed in on a "Korean wave" fashion craze among younger Chinese for South Korean cultural products from music to cosmetics and clothing.               

"Since the South Korean market is very small, Korean companies have to go overseas to survive," said Hwang You-sun, deputy general manager at Korea Trade Investment Promotion Agency (Kotra) in Shanghai.               

"Data has shown China's economy is weakening because of industrial restructuring but Korean companies consider China's internal demand to be big and thus are optimistic about the outlook."               

For example, Amorepacific Group Corp, South Korea's largest cosmetics maker, is expanding its production and R&D centre in Shanghai with a target to produce 13,000 tons  annually by 2020, or 10 times what it makes now, said Kim Seung-hwan, senior vice president of group strategy.               

South Korea is one of the few developed countries that has a trade surplus with China, its biggest export market.               

Samsung invested $7 billion to build a NAND flash memory factory in Xi'an in northwestern China, which began operations earlier this year, while South Korea's Kia Motors began production at its third factory in China early this year.               

Kia's parent Hyundai Motor Co, which already has three factories in Beijing, plans to build two more in China, sources told Reuters in September.               

While their contributions to South Korea's overall FDI to China remain a small fraction of the total, consumer companies have expanded their presence in China helped by the popularity of South Korean television dramas, especially among young Chinese.               

"The K-wave has been influential on Chinese and it makes Chinese emotionally closer to South Korea than Japan," said Ji-san Kim, an analyst covering South Korean makers of electronics and home appliances at Kiwoom Securities in Seoul.               

Cuckoo Electronics Co, a South Korean maker of high-end rice cookers and other appliances, is expanding its footprint in China, and will increase the number of self-branded stores in the country from 11 now to 20 by 2016. It also sells through 800 multi-brand retailers in China.               

"Thanks to the K-wave, Chinese have become familiar with Korean culture and Korean goods have a positive image," said Cheon Seung Kuk, who heads marketing at Cuckoo, an appliance maker.
