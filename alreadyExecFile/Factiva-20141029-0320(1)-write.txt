SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Thursday it would keep evaluating its former supplier GT Advanced Technologies' progress on developing sapphire production and also consider other options for its plant in Mesa, Arizona.
"Apple put a lot of effort into an ambitious new sapphire manufacturing process with GTAT which is not ready for production," Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said. "We're going to continue evaluating GTAT's progress on larger sapphire boule development, as well as consider other options for the facility."

Nokia Gives Bullish Outlook as It Swings Back to Profit; Finnish Telecom-Equipment Maker Benefits From Sales to North America and China and Tax Gain

STOCKHOLM¡XNokia Corp.¡¦s quarterly earnings gave ample evidence that the company¡¦s main network unit has moved well beyond several years of painful restructuring.
In its earnings report on Thursday, the Finnish former handset giant gave a more bullish full-year financial outlook after swinging back to profit in the third quarter. Its earnings were boosted by a 13% rise in revenue, as the Finnish telecom-equipment supplier deployed high-speed mobile networks in North America and China.
Nokia¡¦s net profit in the quarter was £á747 million ($941 million), compared with a £á91 million loss in the three months to end-September last year, helped also by a large tax gain in the quarter. Revenue rose to £á3.32 billion, higher than market expectations of £á3.02 billion.
¡§Progress was widespread, with four of our six regions increasing sales,¡¨ Nokia¡¦s chief executive, Rajeev Suri, said.
Mr. Suri has headed Nokia¡¦s mobile network unit since 2009 and was appointed as Nokia¡¦s CEO in late April this year, as the company transferred its loss-making phone business to Microsoft Corp. Without its ailing handset business, Nokia is now a mobile networks firm that competes with Huawei Technologies Co. and Ericsson. It also has a Berlin-based digital mapping operation and a large pile of patents.
Nokia¡¦s mobile-network arm, which until recently was plagued with overcapacity and losses after a difficult merger with Siemens¡¦ mobile network unit, has seen a spectacular comeback over the course of the past year, and is currently benefiting from deals with the likes of China Mobile Ltd. and Sprint Corp. in the U.S., which are ramping up their high-speed mobile Internet services.
Nokia updated its outlook for the year, saying it expects a full-year operating profit margin of slightly above 11%, having previously forecast a margin in the high single digits. It confirmed that it expects net sales for its main networks unit to grow on a year-on-year basis in the second half of 2014.
Nokia¡¦s stock rose sharply Thursday on the Helsinki stock exchange after the earnings release, finishing the day 3.5% higher at £á6.74. Analysts widely agreed that the company¡¦s results were impressive.
¡§Retaining [its] market share while implementing such a drastic cost-cutting program is an impressive exercise, which the company should take great pride in,¡¨ Nordea analyst Sami Sarkamies wrote in a note to investors, while cautioning that Nokia¡¦s networks business is a relatively small operation, sensitive to quarterly swings in project invoicing and margins.
Mr. Suri described the performance of the company¡¦s main networks business as ¡§particularly satisfying,¡¨ but cautioned that the unit benefited from some ¡§unique developments¡¨ in the quarter, such as a favorable business and regional mix.
The Finnish company booked a £á2 billion tax benefit in the quarter, which was partly offset by a £á1.2 billion goodwill impairment charge related to its HERE digital mapping unit. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Suri said the accounting charge for HERE was the ¡§right thing to do, considering the track record of HERE and the ways things are progressing.¡¨
Unlike Google Inc. and Apple Inc.¡¦s mapping services, Nokia¡¦s platform largely targets corporate customers, like auto makers and logistics-dependent businesses such as FedEx Corp., which pay licensing fees. Still, the company is about to release free-of-charge map apps for consumers using mobile devices running Google¡¦s Android and Apple¡¦s iOS platform.
Mr. Suri, however, said he isn¡¦t in favor of running adverts on Nokia¡¦s mapping service, as Google does, and that the business will remain geared toward enterprise customers and the automotive industry. He added that while its mapping operation may appear an odd fit next to Nokia¡¦s network business, the company is a suitable owner of the unit.
¡§Nokia is a good owner of HERE, we have a balance sheet that can help the operation,¡¨ he said, adding that combining advanced high-speed network technology with a mapping asset can assist developers of autonomous cars, for instance.
In a separate announcement on Thursday, Nokia said it would appoint Sean Fernback as the new president of its HERE unit. Mr. Fernback, a former TomTom NV executive, joined HERE earlier this year and will succeed Michael Halbherr, who stepped down and left the unit in August.

Logitech Says Tablet Slowdown Won¡¦t Derail Its Turnaround; Peripherals Maker Reported Second-Quarter Net Profit More Than Doubled

ZURICH¡XLogitech International SA¡¦s turnaround won¡¦t be derailed by a slowdown in the tablet computer market, the company¡¦s chief executive said Thursday, even though the peripherals maker has hitched much of its revival to mobile computing devices.
On Wednesday, Logitech, based in Newark, Calif., and Lausanne, Switzerland, said its profit more than doubled during its second quarter, even though sales of tablet accessories, like detachable keyboards, fell 19% in the period amid a slowdown in tablet sales.
In an interview, Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said a slowdown in the tablet market wouldn¡¦t disrupt Logitech¡¦s growth. He said the company isn¡¦t dependent on one market, pointing to the success of a newly launched computer mouse designed for videogamers and mobile speakers.
¡§If tablets slow down, we have other growth areas,¡¨ said Mr. Darrell, adding that tablet accessory sales would likely pick up early next year as new products hit the market. ¡§We are not dependent on tablets or any one single platform to deliver our turnaround.¡¨
Logitech, the world¡¦s biggest maker of computer mouses, was caught flat-footed by the sudden rise of tablets and smartphones. Since taking over early last year, Mr. Darrell has pushed the company to have shorter design and production cycles so that its peripherals can be in stores shortly after the launch of new devices. Many of those are designed for popular tablet computers, like Apple Inc.¡¦s iPads and Samsung Electronics Co.¡¦s Galaxy tablets.
However, growth in tablet computer sales has slowed this year. Worldwide unit shipments are expected to grow 11% in 2014, a sharp deceleration from 55% growth in 2013, according to estimates by market researcher Gartner Inc.
Logitech has broadened its product range, launching a new gaming keyboard and mouse, a new wireless mouse and a multiple-device keyboard that can be used with tablets and smartphones. Mr. Darrell said new products would continue to be launched in the coming months, including products for Apple¡¦s new iPad.
On Thursday, Logitech indicated the strategy was paying off. Net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 increased 151% to $36.1 million from $14.4 million a year earlier. The result, driven by cost cuts and the absence of restructuring charges it faced last year, beat analysts¡¦ forecast of $23.4 million.
Sales fell slightly to $530.3 million from $532 million a year earlier, in line with forecasts of $530 million.
Logitech confirmed its guidance for full-year operating income to $170 million.
¡§The results show that Logitech is no longer dependent on one or two categories,¡¨ said Michael Foeth, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich. Mr. Foeth rates Logitech at buy.
During the period, Logitech¡¦s mobile speaker business was its star performer, posting triple-digit sales growth. The mobile speakers work with smartphones and tablet computers.
Logitech said an investigation of accounting matters related to previously issued financial statements is now closed. The company expects to file its reports as soon as possible with the SIX Swiss Exchange and Nasdaq, which carries its U.S. listing.

A Reason to Stress About Europe Banks
When everyone is staring in one direction, it often pays to look the other way.
European bank stocks have endured a wild ride as the Continent's "stress test" results near. The European Central Bank is due to release them Sunday. Greek, Portuguese and some Italian and Spanish banks have suffered especially.
That is understandable. There are plenty of questions about European banks' capital strength. And no one wants to own a bank that comes asking for more equity.
But too many banks have been tainted by this worry. So there is a good chance that solid, unloved institutions will rally once the uncertainty of the stress tests is past and investors can refocus on the ECB's stimulus efforts.
If, that is, the tests are credible. A lot rides on the stress tests for the ECB, which takes over eurozone bank supervision from national governments next month.
Its reputation will be based on its review of banks' books and the stress tests.
The last tests under the sole supervision of the European Banking Authority were risible; several banks passed only to require bailouts later.
Even with the ECB now at the helm, there is skepticism about how conclusive the tests will be. Europe, after all, has many competing voices and levels of economic health. Muddy political compromise is a near-inevitable outcome.
And the European tests can never draw the same bright line as did those in the U.S. in 2009. The ECB, for example, can tell a bank it must raise capital. But it can't promise that a government will inject some if the bank can't or won't.
However, because the last European tests didn't work and the ECB's own credibility rests on the new ones, there is a decent chance they will be good enough. While some banks will indeed fail, investors may find there is opportunity to be had in a glass-half-full approach.
As things now stand, banks such as ING Groep of the Netherlands and Credit Agricole or even BNP Paribas of France aren't valued as recovery stories with big gains due from once-bad assets. Nor are they shunned as weaklings or firms overburdened by regulatory fines to come.
ING has cleaned up its balance sheet, sold insurance businesses and is cutting funding costs. Credit Agricole has seen its capital base grow strongly, although a lot has come from investment gains in its insurance unit. BNP Paribas has yet to resolve a U.S. dollar-clearing ban that arose from its sanctions busting, but is performing well otherwise and should benefit from ECB monetary actions.
All three are valued at less than 0.9 times book value, while ING and BNP also have unchallenging forward price/earnings ratios of about 10 times. Credit Agricole trades at 11.5 times forward earnings, but has a lower book value multiple of 0.6 times.
A credible-enough stress-test result could see these kinds of banks rerated. If BNP's valuation moves up to the multiple of J.P. Morgan Chase's at about 0.94 times, for example, that would lift BNP's shares more than 30%.
Investors with a higher risk appetite also could look at weaker banks that might still pass, especially if hedge funds have bet heavily against those stocks. Their prices could leap if investors are forced to buy back stock to cover those short wagers.
Portugal's Banco Comercial Portugues and smaller Spanish banks like Sabadell and Banco Popular Espanol have heavy so-called short interest, according to data from Markit Group. Notably, the second-most-shorted bank stock in the Stoxx 600 is ING.
Beyond the stress tests, Europe still faces low economic growth and low interest rates, so it will be some time before banks see lending and interest-income growth. Then again, things have been so desperate that any signs of life would be good. And, should credible stress tests relieve capital concerns, European bank stocks will be looked at in a different way.

BOE's Gloomier Outlook
Challenges U.K. Debt Bet
A bet that yields on U.K. and German government bonds would diverge has been a profitable strategy as markets increasingly priced in a strong U.K. recovery versus a lackluster eurozone performance. The latest Bank of England minutes, published Wednesday, show why that wager may be running out of steam.
The trade has worked ever since September 2012, when yields on 10-year U.K. gilts and German bunds were virtually level at around 1.55%, according to FactSet data. Since then, bund yields have fallen to 0.84% while gilt yields have risen to 2.22%. Since bond yields and prices move in inverse relation, this means gilt prices have fallen while those of bunds have risen.
But recent market volatility has taken its toll. The gap between the benchmark instruments has tightened from its widest level above 1.5 percentage points in September, when gilt yields hit 2.57%.
And there is growing reason to believe that the yield gap will have a tough time widening as significantly again. Inflation in the U.K. declined unexpectedly to 1.2% in September, well below the BOE's 2% target. And while the U.K. economy is expected to continue to grow, the pace may slow somewhat.
The third-quarter reading for U.K. growth, due Friday, will be closely watched in this regard. It isn't clear how well the U.K. can withstand weak growth in Europe and emerging markets.
The latest BOE minutes underline this. True, two members of the Monetary Policy Committee, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, continued to vote for a 0.25-percentage-point rate increase. That was despite the fact the committee knew the low inflation number when it met.
But the other seven committee members seemed to be more concerned about global developments and a lack of domestic inflationary pressures. BOE chief economist Andrew Haldane last week noted that his view of the economy was "gloomier" than a few months ago. Wage inflation seems likely to be the key factor to watch. So far, it has been notable by its absence.
The somewhat weaker outlook for the U.K. is a problem for the gilt-bund trade. Set against that, the eurozone position looks much more worrying. The ECB is still under pressure to loosen policy further; the U.K., by contrast, is still looking at rate increases, albeit starting later than the market thought until recently.
So the yield gap could widen again. But the big money likely has been made on this trade already.

Samsung Finds Strength in Family
It is time to stop thinking of Samsung Electronics as a smartphone company.
Samsung's runaway success the past few years in smartphones had investors wondering if the South Korean giant could become the next Apple. That seems increasingly unlikely. But Samsung's leading position in less sexy chips, displays and other parts, plus its cheap valuation, still make it a company worth owning.
Samsung's mobile division, dominated by smartphones, brought in more than two-thirds of the company's operating profit last year, up from just around one-quarter in 2010. Yet that era of smartphone dominance was short-lived. The mobile division was likely the main culprit behind the company's forecast for a 60% decline in third-quarter operating profit. Shares are down nearly 20% this year.
There seems little prospect of a smartphone turnaround in the near future, given intense competition at the high end from Apple. At the low end is heat from Chinese handset makers.
The outlook is less gloomy for Samsung's components businesses. In memory chips, it is the leader in both technology and in terms of scale in an industry once riven by competition, but now consolidated to just a handful of profitable players.
The stock looks cheap at eight times forward earnings and 1.1 times book value, below the 10-year averages of 10 times earnings and 1.7 times book. Back out $44.4 billion of net cash, and it trades at just six times forward earnings.
Even assuming Samsung's mobile business is worthless, which it isn't, the stock looks undervalued. Putting the chip business at two times book value -- a discount to rivals, which trade at an average of nearly three times -- and adding Samsung's cash and investments, leaves a higher valuation than the current market capitalization, notes Mark Newman of Bernstein Research.
In fact, Samsung has been cheap, at around eight times earnings or below, since the middle of 2012, even before the smartphone business peaked. What is missing is a catalyst to unlock value.
Investors have agitated for the company to return more of its massive cash reserves to boost the stock. Samsung had hinted for months that it would unveil a detailed plan to send more cash to shareholders with its first-half results, only to backtrack in July, saying it needed more time.
This foot-dragging is partially explained by the stock's true problem: the convoluted structure through which the Lee family controls the broader Samsung empire. Since family patriarch Lee Kun-hee was hospitalized with a heart attack earlier this year, his children appear to have started work on an opaque plan to rearrange assets.
One likely objective is to consolidate control over crown jewel Samsung Electronics, in which Lee family members hold only a small direct stake. This means they would benefit little from a distribution of cash to shareholders before the reshuffle.
Similarly, Mr. Lee's heirs face a 50% inheritance tax on his stake in Samsung Electronics. There is little incentive for them to boost the share price beforehand.
Samsung's smartphone woes look set to continue. But bright prospects for its other business aren't reflected in the share price. For now, investors will have to wait for that value to be unlocked by the Lee family.

Overheard
Gold and platinum are prized for their rarity. What is happening with their prices right now is also pretty unusual.
At about $1,245 an ounce, gold isn't far off parity with platinum at about $1,270. This doesn't happen often. In the past 20 years, gold has matched or exceeded the platinum price only about 7% of the time. And much of that occurred between the summer of 2011 and early 2013, when quantitative easing was in full swing and hyperbole about the dollar's demise was at its height.
Similarly, the current price action reflects an anxious world. Gold hasn't really gained much this year; rather, platinum has collapsed since July. This makes sense. as more than half of platinum demand relates to industrial, primarily, automotive uses. Deflation fears have hurthave industrial commodities.
Gold usually benefits when such extreme scenarios seem plausible. There is one twist: Negative inflation would imply rising real interest rates. The latter erode the case for holding nonyielding assets such as precious metals. Even so, the rare melding of gold and platinum prices is an unwelcome sign that optimism about growth is rapidly becoming the rarest commodity of all.

Filming in fear: Edward Snowden as 'Citizenfour'
U.S. documentary maker Laura Poitras has found herself in many a risky situation in Iraq and Yemen. But she never felt in as much danger as when she was filming Edward Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel while he prepared to blow the whistle on massive secret surveillance programs run by the U.S. government. Those tense eight days form the centerpiece of "Citizenfour," her account of how the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor decided in 2013 to release to the media tens of thousands of classified documents, and the global repercussions of that action.

* Gemalto reports Q3 revenue below expectations
* SIM card & payment security firm reasserts long-term goals
* CEO says market "overreacted" to Apple SIM card announcement (Adds CEO comments, detail)
By Nicholas Vinocur
Oct 22 (Reuters) - Gemalto NV, the Franco-Dutch digital security company that makes smart chips for mobile phones, bank cards and biometric passports, reiterated long-term revenue and profit targets on Thursday and said Apple's move to pre-install its own SIM cards in iPads did not threaten its business, as third-quarter revenue came in below expectations.
The company said it would still achieve a double-digit growth rate in its profit from operations for the full year as well as faster revenue growth in the rest of 2014.
Third-quarter revenue was 626 million euros($791.70 million) on a constant currency basis, helped by growth in EMV payment cards. However, it was below average analyst expectations for revenue of 661 million euros.
Gemalto shares slumped this week after Apple announced that new tablets sold in the United States would be equipped with its own SIM cards for connecting to mobile phone networks, which some analysts said could rob Gemalto of revenue.
Gemalto's CEO Olivier Piou said he had struggled to understand the market's reaction as SIM cards only made up a small fraction of Gemalto's revenue and that greater use of payment chips in general was good for the brand.
"Every time Apple makes an announcement there's an overreaction, but this time, it was more surprising," he said. "The more the market grows... for (payment) security hardware, the more those things need to be administered, and the more Gemalto is able to profit."
Piou added that Gemalto would profit from U.S. government decisions to make all public bodies use two-step authentication procedures - which Gemalto administers - and make all public financial institutions take standard EMV payment cards.
EMV is a fraud-reducing technology built into payment cards with a smart chip.
Analysts said Gemalto's long-term targets "looked "optimistic".
"While Gemalto continues to expect double-digit growth in EBIT for the full-year 2014, we would argue that it remains optimistic given weakness on the top line," Credit Suisse said in a research note.
Piou said part of the shortfall had to do with the delayed roll-out of World Bank development programmes in Western Africa, due to the outbreak of the Ebola virus, which in turn had cut into Gemalto's predicted revenue.
Gemalto's revenue from payment and identity products grew by 12 percent to 289.2 million euros on a constant currency basis.
Chief Executive Olivier Piou said in a statement that Gemalto's EMV revenues in the United States tripled and Asia grew by 18 percent, adding that the company's pace of growth accelerated during the third quarter.
The group reaffirmed its profit forecasts for the years ahead that it made in August along with the announcement of the acquisition of U.S.-based data protection specialist SafeNet for $890 million.
Gemalto reaffirmed that the deal should allow it to raise its 2017 target for profit from operations of 600 million euros by 10 percent. (U.S. $1 = 0.7907 euros) (Reporting by Aurindom Mukherjee in Bangalore & Nicholas Vinocur in Paris; Editing by Leslie Adler and Greg Mahlich)

Amazon.com Inc. had what seemed like a mixed day on July 24: It unveiled disappointing second-quarter earnings, but it also began selling its much-anticipated Fire phone.
It now looks like the company got badly burned by its handset ambitions. Despite what appears to be an epic flop, in addition to bad publicity from its tiff with a major publisher and tax issues in Europe, investors seem sanguine. The stock has now recovered from the 10% drop following the July 24 release.
Assuming the bar has been set low enough for third-quarter results, due Thursday, investors should avoid a fourth consecutive tumble following an earnings report. Analysts expect a per-share loss of 75 cents compared with a loss of nine cents a year earlier. Expectations have dropped steadily from a forecast of a 38-cent profit a year ago.
Calling market reaction to Amazon's earnings rash is an understatement. The average change in its shares in the session following an earnings release has been 9% since 2007. Happily, there have been about twice as many pops as drops.
Investors' reaction has had much to do with whether they chose to focus on surging sales or minuscule profits. Amazon expects third-quarter revenue to be 15% to 26% higher than a year before, probably satisfying those watching the top line.
So with the stock down by more than one-fifth in the year to date, is it a temporary bargain or grossly expensive?
That hinges partly on what exactly Amazon is: part megaretailer like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., part bookseller like Barnes & Noble Inc., part phone-and-tablet maker like Apple Inc., part fee-supported shopping club like Costco Wholesale Corp., part cloud-services provider like Rackspace Hosting Inc. and part video streaming service like Netflix Inc.
Those companies sport trailing multiples of debt-adjusted market value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of between seven and 13.5 times. On revenue, the range is even wider: 0.5 to 4.1 times. On the earnings measure, Amazon is 220% more expensive than the group, on average. On revenue it is 28% cheaper.
Best-in-class in some fields but certainly not all, Amazon's fans insist profitability could surge if it decides to sacrifice growth. Recent weakness shows the market is finally holding management's feet to the fire.

Huawei says third-quarter smartphone shipments jump 26 percent, strong demand for high-end devices

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd said third-quarter smartphone shipments jumped 26 percent year-on-year, doubling devices shipped to the high-margin premium market dominated by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc.
Shenzhen-based Huawei, the world's third-biggest smartphone supplier after the dominant pair, shipped 16.8 million smartphones globally in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to company data. About a quarter of those were mid- to high-end models, more than twice as many as the same period last year.
"We are breaking our bottlenecks of mid- to high-end models step by step, especially in overseas markets," Huawei consumer business group marketing executive Shao Yang told Reuters in an interview.
Huawei, like Chinese rivals Lenovo Group Ltd and ZTE Corp, is better known for selling low- and mid-priced handsets in emerging markets than high-end models in developed countries.
Industry watchers say that although Huawei's premium devices are cutting-edge, the company has struggled to break into the high-end sector markets like the United States due to a lack of brand recognition and security concerns. Huawei had 6.7 percent of the global smartphone market in the second quarter, a distant third behind Samsung Electronics and Apple, according to analysis firm IDC.
As if to prove a point, Huawei unveiled a smartphone with an advanced sapphire glass display just days before Apple released its highly anticipated iPhone 6 in September.
"We have never questioned our ability to make products, but sometimes we are worried if we could occupy a place emotionally in consumers' hearts. So we will try to achieve that next year," Shao said.
Huawei's global marketing budget would leap at least 30 percent in 2015, compared with $440 million this year, he said.
The company has shipped 51 million smartphones globally in the first three quarters of 2014 - about 63.8 percent of its annual shipment target of 80 million, according to Reuters' calculations, based on figures provided by Huawei.
Shao said he expected quarter-on-quarter shipments growth of up to 80 percent in the fourth quarter, a peak holiday season for smartphone vendors.
A little more than half of Huawei's smartphone shipments went to China in the third quarter. Elsewhere, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific recorded the strongest growth.

(Adds context, details of Cook's visit)
BEIJING, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company is planning to open 25 retail stores in China within the next two years, according to a Chinese transcript of an interview posted by web portal Sina.com.
Apple, which currently earns about 15 percent of its revenue in Greater China, has 15 outlets in the country. The Apple chief executive made similar comments Monday on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.
"We're investing like crazy in the market," Cook said on the call. "When I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are more people graduating into the middle class than any nation on Earth in history."
Cook is visiting China, where he has toured Foxconn Technology Co's iPhone factory in Zhengzhou and looked at local retail operations.
On Wednesday, Cook met with China's Vice Minister Ma Kai, where the two exchanged views on "protection of users' information" as well as "strengthening cooperation," according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
On Friday, Cook will attend meetings at Beijing's Tsinghua University as a member of the School of Economics and Management's advisory council. He will be joined there by Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook Inc founder, and other global business leaders.
The Apple chief also said the company is cooperating with Chinese firms including Baidu Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to today's online transcript.
Cook also said he will meet with Jack Ma, Alibaba's chairman, on Monday. (Reporting by Matthew Miller; Editing by Stephen Coates and Ryan Woo)

Can You Trust That Web Price?

The Web is full of personalized content, whether it's a Netflix recommendation or the results of a Google search.
But consumers have protested when e-commerce companies have extended their behind-the-scenes personalization to prices, charging different sums for the same goods, or pushing some people toward higher-priced offers.
A new study of top e-commerce websites found these practices -- called discriminatory pricing or price steering -- are much more widespread than was previously understood.
The study, by a team of computer scientists at Northeastern University, tracked searches on 16 popular e-commerce sites. Six of those sites used the pricing techniques; none of the sites alerted consumers to that fact.
Among the study's findings: Travel-booking sites Cheaptickets and Orbitz charged some users searching hotel rates an average $12 more per night if they weren't logged into the sites, and Travelocity charged users of Apple Inc.'s iOS mobile operating system $15 less for hotels than other users.
Home Depot Inc. shows mobile-device users products that are roughly $100 more expensive than those offered to desktop-computer users. And Expedia and Hotels.com steer users at random to pricier products, the study said.
"In the real world, there are coupons and loyalty cards, and people are fine with that," said Christo Wilson, an assistant professor at Northeastern who led the research team. "Here, there's a transparency problem. The algorithms change regularly, so you don't know if other people are getting the same results."
Travelocity, a unit of Sabre Corp., didn't respond to a request for comment.
Home Depot didn't dispute the accuracy of the findings, but the home-improvement retailer wasn't "intentionally steering search results," said company spokesman Stephen Holmes.
Many factors could influence what a customer sees on the company's sites, Mr. Holmes said, including prior browsing and purchase history, the location of the store, and whether the customer is on mobile or not.
Home Depot didn't charge users different prices for identical products but showed more-expensive products to people who shopped using a smartphone, the researchers found.
Chris Chiames, vice president of corporate affairs at Orbitz Worldwide Inc., said in an email that the company clearly advertises its loyalty programs and other deals. He said the discounts some members see on the site apply to just a small proportion of hotels -- fewer than 5%. So, it wouldn't make sense, and might even be misleading, to advertise lower prices to all members, he said.
"The Northeastern study states that 'overall, most of the experiments do not reveal evidence of steering or discrimination,' and so we are curious as to why a handful of exceptions to searches on thousands of hotels is the basis of this paper's conclusions, or even worthy of a story," Mr. Chiames added. "Would you be as interested in a Kmart 'blue light special' deal that was made available to shoppers who happen to be in a certain store at a certain time?"
Moreover, some deals are priced by Orbitz's hotel partners, he added. "The hotel might have limited inventory of that price, and so they choose to display the rate on a more-limited basis, akin to the flash sale," he said.
On Orbitz and Cheaptickets, also owned by Orbitz Worldwide, consumers who registered through the websites' free log-in were shown a tab labeled "members only" that offered lower hotel prices. The company didn't advertise that users could receive discounts for logging in.
Orbitz has been accused of price discrimination in the past. A 2012 Wall Street Journal investigation found the company charged Mac users as much as 30% more than PC users for a night's lodging.
The company discontinued the practice, which it characterized as a month-long experiment. The Northeastern researchers confirmed the company no longer discriminates between Mac and PC users.
Expedia and Hotels.com, both units of Expedia Inc., don't show different prices because of users' differing characteristics but because the company constantly refines its pricing strategies using a method called A/B testing, the researchers said. Shoppers are randomly placed in a group that highlights either less or more costly hotels. "Either way, the user has no idea what bucket they've been placed in," said Northeastern's Mr. Wilson.
One group of users, for example, were shown an average hotel listing price of $187 a night. The other group saw prices that were $17, or roughly 10%, less.
"Presenting different booking paths and options to different customers allows us to determine which features customers appreciate most" said Expedia spokesman Dave McNamee, in an email. "Pricing is not manipulated by Expedia.com."
Consumers have long protested price discrimination. In 2000, Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos apologized for an internal research program in which consumers were shown different prices for identical products. He called the experiment a "mistake." (Amazon and eBay Inc. weren't included in the Northeastern study because those companies' services have little power over the prices they charge, the researchers said.)
Staples Inc. varied its online prices based on users' locations, according to a 2012 article in The Wall Street Journal. The researchers didn't examine Staples but pointed out that retailers might vary prices by region because the cost of procuring a given product can differ in different parts of the country. They didn't study geographic variations for that reason.
In their study, the Northeastern researchers devised a statistical method to weed out what they called "noise," or legitimate factors that might cause prices to vary.
The research team recruited 300 beta users, who allowed the researchers to track their experience on different sites.
The team also developed hundreds of fake accounts to see whether historical purchase patterns and clicks through the sites had an impact on price personalization.

In one corner of his workshop in Almagro, Buenos Aires' up-and-coming tango district, skateboard decks stripped of their black grip tape and wheels are piled high.
Filming in fear: Edward Snowden as 'Citizenfour'
U.S. documentary maker Laura Poitras has found herself in many a risky situation in Iraq and Yemen. But she never felt in as much danger as when she was filming Edward Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel while he prepared to blow the whistle on massive secret surveillance programs run by the U.S. government. Those tense eight days form the centerpiece of "Citizenfour," her account of how the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor decided in 2013 to release to the media tens of thousands of classified documents, and the global repercussions of that action.

SEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix Inc said on Thursday its third-quarter operating profit rose 11.7 percent from a year earlier, backed by firm memory chip demand from personal computers as well as the launch of new smartphone products.
The world's second-largest memory chip maker reported 1.3 trillion won ($1.24 billion) in operating profit for the July-September quarter, matching the mean forecast of 1.3 trillion won in a poll of 36 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company had guided for slower sequential shipments growth for both DRAM and NAND chips in the quarter, though it expected market conditions to remain favourable thanks to firm demand for personal computers and servers.
Launch of new smartphones such as Apple Inc's new iPhones were also expected to help sales for SK Hynix. (1 US dollar = 1,052.4100 Korean won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Michael Perry) )

Corporate News: At Sony, Hopes Dim For Its Smartphones

TOKYO -- Sony Corp. is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, as the business struggles in the face of fierce competition -- especially in emerging markets.
The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43 million for the 12 months ending March 2015, those people said. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50 million, which many analysts said at the time was too optimistic.
The expected revision stems from Sony's plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets.
Sony disappointed investors in September when it announced it would write down 180 billion yen ($1.68 billion) of the smartphone segment's business value and forecast a 230 billion yen net loss for the current business year -- almost five times what it previously expected.
For Sony watchers, the latest plan won't come as much of a surprise, as company executives, including Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, have signaled a downsizing of the smartphone business in some countries after concluding that introducing entry-level models for emerging markets was a mistake. Sony plans to hold a meeting with investors in November, and Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said details of how it will update the smartphone business plan would be unveiled there.
Sony's Xperia smartphone business was once a star player for the company, but is now experiencing trouble. It has been hit by the emergence of Chinese makers of cheap handsets, while it continues to struggle in competition against market leaders Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.
The Xperia will remain a core business for the company along with image sensors and the gaming business, but Mr. Yoshida has said at news conferences that the smartphone segment will focus on high-end models and won't seek a major share of the global market.
Mr. Hirai said in September that Sony would cut 1,000 jobs, or 15% of its global smartphone business workforce, by March. Some analysts said the cuts weren't enough to turn around the segment.
Sony is to announce its results for the July-September period on Oct. 31. While analysts expect a net loss due to the 180 billion yen smartphone charges, they say it is unlikely the company would again revise its earnings forecast lower for the year.
New York hedge-fund firm Third Point LLC, which unsuccessfully sought a partial spinoff of Sony's entertainment business, said Tuesday said that it had sold its stake in Sony for a return of nearly 20%, saying in a letter to its investors that "more urgency" was necessary to "definitively turn around the company's fortunes."

Samsung Electronics Finds
Strength in Product Family
It is time to stop thinking of Samsung Electronics as a smartphone company.
Samsung's runaway success the past few years in smartphones had investors wondering if the South Korean giant could become the next Apple. That seems increasingly unlikely. But Samsung's leading position in less sexy chips, displays and other parts, plus its cheap valuation, still make it a company worth owning.
Samsung's mobile division, dominated by smartphones, brought in more than two-thirds of the company's operating profit last year, up from just around a quarter in 2010. Yet that era of smartphone dominance was short-lived. The mobile division was likely the main culprit behind the company's forecast for a 60% decline in third-quarter operating profit. Shares are down nearly 20% this year.
There seems little prospect of a smartphone turnaround in the near future, given intense competition at the high end from Apple. At the low end is heat from Chinese handset makers that rely on the same Android operating system Samsung uses.
The outlook is less gloomy for Samsung's components businesses. In memory chips, it is the leader in both technology and in terms of scale in an industry once riven by competition, but now consolidated to just a handful of profitable players.
In logic chips, Samsung lost a major customer when Apple switched over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for its iPhones. But Samsung is ahead of TSMC in the next generation of smaller-transistor chips, and analysts predict it will win back some Apple orders next year. Similarly in displays, Samsung is at the technological forefront with organic light-emitting diode technology.
The stock looks cheap at eight times forward earnings and 1.1 times book value, below the 10-year averages of 10 times earnings and 1.7 times book. Back out $44.4 billion of net cash, and it trades at just six times forward earnings.
Even assuming Samsung's mobile business is worthless, which it isn't, the stock looks undervalued. Putting the chip business at two times book value -- a discount to rivals, which trade at an average of nearly three times -- and adding Samsung's cash and investments, leaves a higher valuation than the current market capitalization, notes Mark Newman of Bernstein Research.
In fact, Samsung has been cheap, at around eight times earnings or below, since the middle of 2012, even before the smartphone business peaked. What is missing is a catalyst to unlock value.
Investors have agitated for the company to return more of its massive cash reserves to boost the stock. Samsung had hinted for months that it would unveil a detailed plan to send more cash to shareholders with its first-half results, only to backtrack in July, saying it needed more time.
This foot-dragging is partially explained by the stock's true problem: the convoluted structure through which the Lee family controls the broader Samsung empire. Since family patriarch Lee Kun-hee was hospitalized with a heart attack earlier this year, his children appear to have started work on an opaque plan to rearrange assets.
One likely objective is to consolidate control over crown jewel Samsung Electronics, in which Lee family members hold only a small direct stake. This means they would benefit little from a distribution of cash to shareholders before the reshuffle.
Similarly, Mr. Lee's heirs face a 50% inheritance tax on his stake in Samsung Electronics. There is little incentive for them to boost the share price beforehand.
Samsung's smartphone woes look set to continue. But bright prospects for its other business aren't reflected in the share price. For now, investors will have to wait for that value to be unlocked by the Lee family.

The Clock Ticks as Yahoo
Searches for Some Answers
Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has bought herself some time. But the clock is still ticking.
Yahoo reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday. Revenue rose 1% versus a year earlier. That is paltry for a tech company but still better than year-over-year declines seen in some recent quarters.
Notably, the company broke out its mobile revenue for the first time, saying it came in at $200 million in the quarter. It also forecast gross mobile revenue of $1.2 billion this year.
That is a major shift. And Yahoo said mobile, social, native and video ads rose a combined 80% year over year. The gains appear to be helping offset declines in Yahoo's traditional display-ad business.
Yet they also may raise eyebrows. Yahoo offered few details on how it accomplished such a sizable swing. The company previously had declined to break out mobile revenue, saying it wasn't material to results.
As well, Yahoo's $1.2 billion forecast amounts to nearly 28% of analysts' consensus estimates for 2014 revenue. That seems to require Yahoo to shift revenue to mobile at an even faster pace in the fourth quarter.
Perhaps more important, Yahoo gave few answers on how it planned to use the net $6.3 billion in cash it got from selling shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding when that company went public last month. Instead, Ms. Mayer defended her acquisition track record and highlighted the $7.7 billion in shares Yahoo has bought back during her tenure.
Yahoo also kicked the can down the road on its strategy for reducing the tax bill on the stakes of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan it continues to own.
Things at Yahoo don't seem to be getting worse. But it is too soon to call them better.

When the cat's away, the mice will trade.
Recent years haven't been kind to stock analysts. Fair-disclosure rules led investors to see less value in Wall Street research. Regulatory scrutiny gave firms more reason to rethink research. From 2000 to 2008, 43 brokers closed research departments. But for chief executives and other corporate insiders looking to trade their companies' shares, this was a boon, suggests research from Wei Wu, a graduate student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Mr. Wu looked at trading behavior of insiders at companies with five or fewer analysts when, as a result of research-department closures, coverage was reduced. He found for each analyst a company lost, returns reaped by insiders increased. Mr. Wu's favored explanation: Important information that would otherwise have been transmitted to investors was lost, increasing trading opportunities for insiders.
Another possibility is that with fewer analysts monitoring the company, insiders felt they had a freer hand to trade.

Asian Pacific Stocks: Nikkei Gains 2.6%; Hong Kong Climbs

Japanese stocks surged for a second time this week, rebounding from a drop Tuesday, while Hong Kong shares gained for a fourth straight day after the government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks for the first time Tuesday.
Asian markets got a boost from a sharp rise in Wall Street shares overnight, driven by strong quarterly results from Apple and news that the European Central Bank is considering further stimulus.
The Nikkei Stock Average led gains in the region, jumping 2.6% to 15195.77, as the dollar moved back above 107 yen.
The latest read on Japanese exports showed a rise of 6.9% from a year earlier in September, helped by a weaker yen and a surge in output among suppliers of components for Apple's new smartphones. Still, Japan's trade deficit edged up 1.6% from a year earlier to 958.3 billion yen ($8.96 billion), the first increase in three months.
Stocks in Japan have had a rough run lately, with big declines last week sending the Nikkei into correction territory, down more than 10% from a late-September peak. On Tuesday the Nikkei lost 2%, after it gained 4% Monday.
The Nikkei tends to rise when the yen falls, because a weaker yen is generally positive for earnings at Japan's exporters. The dollar has backtracked against the yen in October after gaining earlier in the year. Midday Wednesday in New York, the greenback was at 107.28 yen, up from 107 yen late Tuesday.
Shares of Japanese shippers were strong, as the Baltic Dry Index of freight rates rose for a third straight session to a one-month high. Nippon Yusen added 4.3% and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines gained 5.4%.
Sony rose 3.4% after reports it will exit its low-end, emerging-market-oriented smartphone business and on news that activist investor Third Point had sold its Sony stock.
Fujifilm Holdings gained 4.1% after a Nikkei report that the company is likely to book a 20% on-year rise in group operating profit for the April-September fiscal half, to around 70 billion yen, as its digital camera business moved out of the red. The firm is also enjoying positive exposure as the developer of Avigan, currently in demand as an Ebola treatment.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to 23403.97, pushing it to a month-to-date gain of 2.05% despite protests that have hurt the city's retailers and other businesses.
The government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks Tuesday, but there was no agreement over how the city's chief executive should be elected.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.1% to 5385.90, its seventh consecutive rise, putting the index back in positive territory for the year.
BHP Billiton was up 1.5% after the company reported strong petroleum and metallurgical-coal production and solid iron-ore output figures for the September quarter. Rio Tinto gained 2.1%, while fellow iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals added 3.1%.
Australia's largest banks all advanced, climbing between 0.5% and 1.3%. The earnings season for the lenders kicks off next week with National Australia Bank's full-year results.
South Korea's Kospi climbed 1.1% to 1936.97. Hyundai Motor fell 4.2% ahead of its third-quarter report. The firm is expected to post a net profit of 1.87 trillion won ($1.77 billion), down 17% from a year earlier, according to a Wall Street Journal poll.
In India, the S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.8% to 26787.23, its fourth straight rise.

World News: Hong Kong: Hong Kong Media Diverge Over Coverage of Protests

HONG KONG -- As Hong Kong lumbers through its fourth week of pro-democracy protests, the variety of coverage in the local media has laid bare differences in visions for the city's future.
Hong Kong has free-speech protections not available on the mainland, and the territory's 18 daily newspapers and multiple television and radio channels have given the student-led protests wall-to-wall coverage, airing multiple -- often clashing -- viewpoints.
On one side are pro-Beijing newspapers like Ta Kung Pao, which portrays the protests as illegal and unruly. On the other is Apple Daily, which is known for a strident anti-Beijing stance and has long backed calls for a democratic procedure to select the city's politicians.
"You have a spectrum," said Yuen-Ying Chan, director of the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong. "Between them, you try to find the truth."
The split has been clear in the coverage of events. Last week, the beating of a demonstrator by Hong Kong police was caught on video and led to the suspension of the officers allegedly involved. The incident led to diverging news reports.
Apple Daily splashed "Seven Demon Police Surround and Beat Protester for Four Minutes" across its front page, accompanied by photos of the demonstrator's bruised back and face.
Ta Kung Pao focused on what it called the violent behavior of protesters, whom police had been trying to clear from a tunnel before the beating. "Police Assaulted," one of the headlines read, while another labeled protesters "Roadside Despots."
The student-led protesters want anyone to be able to stand for the city's first democratic elections, slated for 2017. China's government ruled this summer that candidates must first be screened by a nominating committee largely loyal to Beijing.
Students took to the streets in late September, blocking major intersections. They gained support from some residents and condemnation from others. There have been few surveys on support for the protests, leaving media outlets as a battleground for public opinion.
While battle lines have long been drawn between papers like Ta Kung Pao and Apple Daily, free-speech advocates say they are uneasy about the dominance of other mainstream newspapers by tycoons with business interests in China. "The temptation, of course, is to not offend mainland China," Ms. Chan said.
Ming Pao is owned by Malaysian timber tycoon Tiong Hiew King; the English-language South China Morning Post is owned by Malaysia's Kuok family, whose interests include agribusiness and hotels; while Richard Li, son of Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, owns the Hong Kong Economic Journal and a pay-TV channel.
Alice Kwok, the chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal, said she didn't feel any pressure from Beijing on how to cover the protests. Ming Pao and the South China Morning Post declined to comment. Ta Kung Pao didn't respond to requests to comment.
Apple Daily -- whose owner, Jimmy Lai, says he has no business dealings in mainland China -- perhaps has faced the most difficulties during the protests.
The newspaper has experienced attacks on its website and demonstrations by pro-Beijing groups outside a complex containing its headquarters and printing plant, delaying the distribution of newspapers.
Officials at Next Media, Apple Daily's parent company, said sales of print copies have increased during the protests. Mr. Lai, a businessman who founded the newspaper in the 1990s, has shrugged off the attacks. "We don't feel any threat," Mr. Lai said. "They are just nuisances."

World News: Hong Kong: Occupy Students Settle Into a Routine

HONG KONG -- When saxophone player Kenny G showed up at the main protest site in Hong Kong on Wednesday, it was an amusing break in the daily routine that has emerged as students settle in for what they say will be a long stay on the streets.
At the main occupation site outside the city's government headquarters, a colorful sea of 1,500 tents has expanded to cover a highway, overpasses, sidewalks and a park, surrounded at nearly every entrance with piles of metal and bamboo barricades designed to keep police out.
In contrast to clashes with police as recently as this weekend in one of the two smaller protest areas, the largest site has been peaceful for a week and has taken on the air of a campground. Protesters read and sleep during the day and are joined by office workers who eat their lunches in a rare open, quiet space in the densely populated city.
The government and students held their first talks in the three-and-a-half-week dispute on Tuesday with neither side budging from their positions. The students are calling for Hong Kong to freely elect its next leader in 2017. The government insists that is impossible under a constitution established with Beijing. No new talks are scheduled.
"The government is not willing to listen, so we will stay here," said 27-year-old theater-worker Harry Pang, sitting beside two yellow and blue tents he pitched in a shady area by Tamar Park, next to the government offices. He has been sleeping at the site for two weeks.
The protest site in the city's Admiralty district, a maze of central government offices, bus stops and the upscale Pacific Place shopping mall, draws crowds after work on warm evenings. Student leaders appear nightly on a rudimentary stage, giving speeches and rallying supporters of a movement that until last week had been waning.
The first public-opinion poll released since the protest began showed increasing support for the students and less support for their opponents. The poll by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that 38% of respondents supported the protesters in October, up from 31.5% in September. More significantly, the portion of the population that doesn't support the protesters dropped to 36% from 46% in September.
The poll of 802 people was taken Oct. 8-15, just over a week after the occupation began on Sept. 28 when police fired tear gas at protesters. In the week since the polling ended, support may have declined as the inconveniences of blocked roads weigh on the public. The poll also said that 53.6% of respondents considered the use of tear gas by the police not appropriate, while 22% said it was appropriate.
Kenny G's appearance isn't the only one by a celebrity, but it was the only one to draw comment from the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing. The saxophonist, who is popular in China, tweeted a photo of himself from the site wishing "everyone a peaceful and positive conclusion to this situation."
Asked about the appearance of the American musician, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, "I don't have a specific grasp of the situation regarding the American citizen you raise who is in Hong Kong participating in the illegal Occupy Central."
At the main protest site, banners hang from bridges and walls are covered with colored Post-it Notes offering support. Some of the tents have names that mock Hong Kong luxury developments and one has a sign appealing to passersby: "If something happens, please wake me up." Young couples take advantage of the freedom from crowded family apartments for romance.
Hong Kong media executive Jimmy Lai, founder of pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, spends many days at the protest sites and said he thinks the protests could last for as long a year. "People just won't go away if there's no solution from the government," he said.
Teenage members of the Scholarism student group, led by 18-year-old Joshua Wong and one of the three main protest organizers, can often be found at tents pitched directly across from Hong Kong's legislative headquarters known as LegCo. Study tables set up next to the Scholarism tents on Wednesday were littered with cookies and reams of statistics homework.
"The future of Hong Kong affects me," said 19-year-old final-year student Calvin Chau, who said he has been going back to class the past few days at the urging of his father. "The movement is more important than studying at the moment."
A group of the teenagers happily accepted ice cream offered by a passerby on Wednesday morning, and people often bring them rice and noodles. A McDonald's and KFC next to the site are often packed, though protesters complain they are getting sick of the food.
The main protest site has calmed considerably after a night of clashes last week when police allegedly dragged a handcuffed protester around a corner and beat him. The officers have been suspended and after that protest leaders and the victim called for calm.
The scene contrasts with the more riotous Mong Kok protest site across Victoria Harbour, which police cleared last week only to see protesters reoccupy during a weekend of violent confrontations.
Unlike most campgrounds, the bathrooms at the main site are remarkably well-stocked and clean. On Wednesday, a ladies' bathroom in the center of the site was crammed with toothpaste and body wash.

iPad Air 2 Review: The Best Tablet Needs to Work Harder; It Has a Quality Screen and Build but It Needs to Go Beyond One-App-at-a-Time Functionality
By Joanna Stern

When Steve Jobs plopped down on the couch, minutes after showing off the iPad for the first time, he said, ¡§It¡¦s so much more intimate than a laptop and so much more capable than a smartphone.¡¨
Four years later, as I watch the YouTube video of the iPad¡¦s debut keynote on the incredibly thin iPad Air 2, that sentence makes my brain ache. Laptops now have touch screens, smartphones are huge and powerful, and tablets now have keyboards. At least, those tablets made by the competition.
Apple¡¦s newest tablet, which goes on sale this week starting at $499, remains true to Jobs¡¦s tablet ideals. It¡¦s the best tablet you can buy¡Xespecially if you want to read headlines on the morning commute, watch ¡§Frozen¡¨ in the back seat and create intricate ¡§Minecraft¡¨ metropolises after dark. If you¡¦ve been waiting to replace an older iPad, now¡¦s the time.
But as I hold the thin piece of glass that would have been unimaginable five years ago, I look over at the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and feel like I am missing something. How this iPad stacks up depends entirely on where you plan to take it¡Xand what you want to do with it.
Home Alone
There¡¦s still no tablet I¡¦d rather cozy up with in bed or on the couch. In those situations, the 6.1mm Air 2 really lives up to its name.
No, we aren¡¦t at the point where it feels like you¡¦re holding a feather, but there is a substantial difference between grasping the 0.96-pound Air 2 and any of the earlier iPads with one hand. I even noticed a difference between it and last year¡¦s original Air. Apple has squeezed down the svelte case so much that it feels as if you¡¦re holding nothing but a screen.
The iPad Air 2 is also far more manageable than Samsung¡¦s Galaxy Tab S 10.5, and its premium aluminum build and soft curved edges top Samsung¡¦s slimy, dimpled plastic cover.
With the lightweight Air 2, you¡¦re more likely to avoid that always painful iPad-on-the-face-fall when you nod off to sleep on the couch. Still, in most situations the smaller iPad Mini is less cumbersome to hold up.
For the things I do when I¡¦ve got my feet up (read long articles I¡¦ve saved in Pocket, sift through Twitter, watch back-to-back episodes of ¡§How I Met Your Mother¡¨), the iPad still beats the competition. The apps are better and more numerous, and they look great on the Retina display.
And shopping online can only get better with the iPad Air 2¡¦s new Touch ID sensor, as soon as more places allow you to use a finger scan instead of a password or credit-card number. And why hasn¡¦t Apple used Touch ID to create multiple iPad user accounts, since the tablet is so often shared among family members?
The Great Outdoors
The new Air¡¦s display addresses one of my biggest complaints about previous iPads: You can finally see the screen outdoors. A thinner display with an anti-reflective layer means unless the sun is really beating down, there¡¦s no need to pitch a towel tent over the screen while sitting by the pool. (Unfortunately, the new iPad Mini 3 doesn¡¦t have the improved screen.)
In my outdoor test, the Air 2 beat last year¡¦s Air, Samsung¡¦s Tab S and Amazon¡¦s previous Fire HDX, displaying a more even balance under both sunlight and shade. Outdoors, it only loses to a bona fide e-reader like the Kindle Paperwhite. But you¡¦ll still have to crank the brightness all the way up to see the screen in the sun, which will run down the battery faster.
That anti-reflective screen also makes a great, though admittedly ginormous, viewfinder for snapping nature shots with the revamped 8-megapixel camera. It takes much crisper shots than before, and in many cases, ones as good as those I can take with my iPhone 6. But I won¡¦t bring my iPad to some mountain peak, as some Apple promo shots suggest. My phone¡¦s camera is the fastest one for me to grab. And it has a flash for low-light situations and took clearer photos of a speedy pig I met in a New York City park. (Relax, it was on a leash.)
Besides, when I set the iPad Air 2 down for a second on a bench, it slid off and hit concrete, shattering the screen. Sure, I¡¦m to blame, but if Apple wants me to climb every mountain armed with nothing but an iPad, ruggedness should be as important as anti-reflectivity.
Planes, Trains and Automobiles
For commuters and travelers, the good news is the Air 2, despite being 18% thinner than the previous Air, still manages to deliver 10 hours of battery life. I didn¡¦t even take the charger out of the box until after I used the tablet for an entire cross-country flight and then a nonstop morning of checking email and writing.
Battery-wise, when it comes to streaming video, the Air 2 and its greatest Samsung rival are pretty evenly matched. At max brightness¡Xwhere the Air 2¡¦s screen is brighter than the 10.5-inch Galaxy Tab S¡Xthe Samsung lasted nine hours where the iPad ran only six. However, when I set the brightness to 50%, the iPad pulled ahead of the Galaxy. (I recommend using auto brightness unless you really need to step it up.)
Improved wireless connectivity is another boon for road warriors. The Air 2 has a faster wireless chip, which, in my testing, loaded Web pages a hair quicker than its predecessor. The cellular model (which, as usual, costs $130 more than its Wi-Fi counterpart, but has dramatically improved 4G LTE) is pre-installed with an Apple SIM that makes it easier to switch service providers, both domestically and abroad. It should be easier for you to use T-Mobile here in the U.S., then buy some gigabytes on the U.K. wireless carrier EE if you happen to be visiting London.
Career Opportunities
If you¡¦re like me, though, you¡¦ll still lug your laptop on business trips. Even as a basic work companion, the Air 2 doesn¡¦t do nearly enough to keep up with the latest competition.
The new A8X processor provides a performance boost, so the iOS 8 operating system and immersive full-screen apps respond to taps and swipes faster. And while iPad apps in general are superior to the stretched phone apps you too often see on Android tablets, I wish I could see more apps on the screen at the same time, the way I can with a Surface or Galaxy Tab.
I constantly yearned for that functionality while responding to emails about potential meeting times, tapping the home button frenetically to switch to the calendar. I yearned for it as I wrote this column, jumping to the messaging app to update my editor on my progress. I even yearned for it when I wasn¡¦t anywhere near my desk, surfing the Web and attempting to tweet an article.
I¡¦d also really love a better way to type. While I¡¦ve gotten faster on Apple¡¦s latest software keyboard (predictive QuickType helps), I¡¦m far more productive typing on real keys. Microsoft¡¦s $80 Universal Mobile Keyboard is one of the best you can buy, but it won¡¦t prop up the screen well enough¡Xand doesn¡¦t double as a cover.
The iPad Air 2 pushes forward in all the ways you¡¦d expect Apple¡¦s tablet to. The blend of screen, build and app quality make it the best full-size tablet you can buy.
But it doesn¡¦t move ahead in one area where some of us have been waiting (desperately) for evolution: true multi-tasking, going beyond the one-app-at-a-time functionality. Perhaps that¡¦s the big surprise that Apple will bring when it introduces a 12.9-inch iPad next year.
It would be nice to see the iPad get beyond the lean-back experience that¡¦s been the focus since Steve Jobs first sat down on the couch.

I love using a desktop computer to write, surf and create, but I¡¦ve had a nagging suspicion that they¡¦re going away. Who needs a desktop in a world with laptops, tablets and even phones that are just as capable?
Last week Apple introduced a new kind of desktop iMac that changed my mind. The new computer is similar in shape and capability to last year¡¦s iMac, except for one amazing feature: It packs four times the resolution into its 27-inch Retina screen. Because it has so many pixels¡X14.7 million, in fact¡Xyou¡¦ll never need to think about pixels again.
Priced at $2,500 and up, you don¡¦t need this new iMac¡Xstandard 27-inch iMacs start at $700 less. But oh boy will you want one, particularly if you spend time working with digital photos or videos. Using the Retina iMac lets you see, for the first time, every pixel you¡¦ve captured all at once.
And even if you¡¦re just buried in spreadsheets and Web pages, it feels like putting on a new pair of glasses. The Retina iMac makes type, icons and images look like they¡¦ve been printed on the screen, while suffering few performance problems for that herculean effort.
Apple is evolving the idea of a desktop computer, and the reason we make space for one in our offices, kitchens and family rooms. We¡¦re used to thinking about desktop computers as workhorse processors and hubs for all our devices. But as our devices go mobile and our content goes online, desktops serve a different purpose, as workhorse screens. No other form of computer lets you so comfortably peer for hours at a time into a big, immersive window on your digital world. The new iMac is the best, clearest window on your digital world that you can buy.
There¡¦s good reason to be suspicious of claims about increased resolution from tech companies trying to give us a reason to upgrade. TV makers and Hollywood first touted HD (1 million pixels), then full HD (2 million pixels). Today, they¡¦re trying to push us to Ultra HD or 4K (8 million pixels). The Retina iMac has 67% more pixels than even 4K, with a 5120x2880-pixel resolution known as 5K.
The truth is, there¡¦s a point at which the human eye just can¡¦t see these ever-shrinking pixels, and naturally it varies depending on how far away you¡¦re sitting from the screen. This superhigh resolution makes sense on a desktop computer, where you typically sit about two feet away. It isn¡¦t as necessary on a TV that¡¦s 10 feet from your eyes.
Looking at that distance onto a regular iMac, I can clearly see the gray mesh of pixels that makes up words and icons on the screen. On a Retina iMac, which has twice as many pixels per inch, the screen is equally bright. But I only see shapes and colors¡Xno pixels. You do have to sit close, though: Step back another foot or two and the regular and Retina displays look about the same.
You may ask, why not just plug a laptop into a giant 5K monitor? So far, at least, there¡¦s no way to do that. Dell announced its UltraSharp 27 Ultra HD 5K in September, but standard laptops today can¡¦t drive it. Besides, when it ships in December, it will cost $2,500. Apple¡¦s 5K display is available today, and for the same price includes the best personal computer Apple has ever made. Apple¡¦s 15- and 13-inch MacBook Pro laptops also have Retina screens with a similar density of pixels, but the iMac¡¦s screen is much, much larger.
What¡¦s this rarefied display really good for? Can you get it instead of a 4K TV for next-generation 4K movies, TV shows and games? At the moment, no. Netflix doesn¡¦t stream 4K content to the iMac like it does to the most recent Ultra HD TVs, and other sources of 4K video are pretty limited.
When using the Retina iMac for Web browsing and office tasks, menus and type are sharper and brighter. The extra resolution isn¡¦t about packing in more lines of text¡Xmost things remain the same size as they appear on other Macs. However, parts of websites that haven¡¦t been designed for these higher resolutions¡Xlike buttons made out of graphics instead of text¡Xcan look correctly sized but a bit fuzzy.
The Retina iMac is a game-changer for creative types¡Xnot just professionals, but anyone with a fancy digital SLR camera or GoPro video rig. These folks need to see every detail in their shots, and this lets you. It¡¦s got nearly as many pixels as the popular Canon 5D Mark III, and shows an entire 4K video, like the one I made on a GoPro Hero 4, with room to spare.
The moment the Retina iMac became valuable to me was when I opened one of my favorite photos of Rome and realized, for the first time, it¡¦s actually out of focus! Maybe I¡¦m not as good a photographer as I¡¦d thought. But at least now I have the tools to sharpen things up.
On the Retina iMac, using Adobe Photoshop is like editing a printed picture. In fact, I tried that: I loaded a panoramic photo on a regular iMac and a Retina iMac next to a 360-dot-per-inch photo from an Epson Stylus Photo R3000 printer. The colors matched across all three. The old and new iMac screens have the same color profile. But only on the hard copy and the Retina iMac could I make out faraway faces and other rich details that make the shot interesting.
My biggest worry was that the computer would choke while trying to drive all those millions of pixels. But performance wasn¡¦t a problem in my tests loading giant images in Photoshop, flicking through a field of previews in Adobe Lightroom or editing 4K video in Final Cut Pro. I tested the $2,499 base configuration, which has a speedy 3.5Ghz Intel Core i5 processor, Radeon graphics chip and ultrafast Fusion Drive. At this price point, Apple skimps on the memory, just 8 GB, but that can be upgraded to 16 for $200, and 32 for $600.
The most conspicuous thing Apple didn¡¦t build into its latest iMac screens is touch control. The company made touch screens go mainstream with the iPhone and iPad, so why not with personal computers? Microsoft does for devices running Windows 8. For one, Apple¡¦s Yosemite operating system is still designed for control with a precision instrument like a mouse or trackpad. In the past, Apple executives have argued that it would cause ¡§gorilla-arm¡¨ fatigue to control a vertical display with your hands, not to mention leave 27 inches of grubby fingerprints for you to worry about cleaning off.
But a touch screen wouldn¡¦t be a reason to buy a Retina iMac, anyway. You¡¦d get one because it will usher you into the post-pixel computing experience where you¡¦ll see things you¡¦ve never seen before. For an amateur¡Xand sometimes blurry¡Xphotographer like me, the advantages of the display justify the price.

Nikkei Leads Rally in Asian Markets; Shares Jump Following Strong Gains on Wall Street

Japanese stocks surged for a second time this week, rebounding from a big drop Tuesday, while Hong Kong shares gained for a fourth straight day after the government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks for the first time Tuesday.
Asian markets got a boost from a sharp rise in Wall Street shares overnight, driven by strong quarterly results from Apple and news that the European Central Bank is considering further stimulus.
The Nikkei Stock Average led gains in the region, jumping 2.6% to 15195.77, as the dollar moved back above ?107.
The latest read on Japanese exports showed a rise of 6.9% from a year earlier in September, helped by a weaker yen and a surge in output among suppliers of components for Apple¡¦s new smartphones. Still, Japan¡¦s trade deficit edged up 1.6% from a year earlier to ?958.3 billion ($8.96 billion), the first increase in three months.
Stocks in Japan have had a rough run lately, with big declines last week sending the Nikkei into correction territory, down more than 10% from a late-September peak. On Tuesday the Nikkei lost 2%, after it gained 4% Monday.
The Nikkei tends to rise when the yen falls, because a weaker yen is generally positive for earnings at Japan¡¦s exporters. The dollar has backtracked against the yen in October after gaining earlier in the year. Midday Wednesday in New York, the greenback was at ?107.28, up from ?107 late Tuesday.
Shares of Japanese shippers were strong, as the Baltic Dry Index of freight rates rose for a third straight session to a one-month high. Nippon Yusen added 4.3% and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines gained 5.4%.
Sony rose 3.4% following reports it will exit its low-end, emerging-market-oriented smartphone business and on news that activist investor Third Point had sold its Sony stock.
Fujifilm Holdings gained 4.1% after a Nikkei report that the company is likely to book a 20% on-year rise in group operating profit for the April-September fiscal half, to around ?70 billion, as its digital camera business moved out of the red. The firm is also enjoying positive exposure as the developer of Avigan, currently in demand as an Ebola treatment.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to 23403.97, pushing it to a month-to-date gain of 2.05% despite protests that have hurt the city¡¦s retailers and other businesses.
The government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks Tuesday, but there was no agreement over how the city¡¦s chief executive should be elected.
Australia¡¦s S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.1% to 5385.90, its seventh consecutive rise, putting the index back in positive territory for the year.
BHP Billiton was up 1.5% after the company reported strong petroleum and metallurgical-coal production and solid iron-ore output figures for the September quarter. Rio Tinto gained 2.1%, while fellow iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals added 3.1%.
Australia¡¦s largest banks all advanced, climbing between 0.5% and 1.3%. The earnings season for the lenders kicks off next week with National Australia Bank¡¦s full-year results.
South Korea¡¦s Kospi climbed 1.1% to 1936.97.
Hyundai Motor fell 4.2% ahead of its third-quarter report. The firm is expected to post a net profit of 1.87 trillion won ($1.77 billion), down 17% from a year earlier, while sales likely fell 12% to 20.57 trillion won, according to a Wall Street Journal poll.
In India, the S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.8% to 26787.23, its fourth straight rise.

Samsung Finds Strength in Family of Products; Electronics Company Leads in Areas Such as Chips and Displays; Valuation Is Inexpensive
By Aaron Back

It is time to stop thinking of Samsung Electronics as a smartphone company.
Samsung¡¦s runaway success the past few years in smartphones had investors wondering if the South Korean giant could become the next Apple. That seems increasingly unlikely. But Samsung¡¦s leading position in less sexy chips, displays and other parts, plus its cheap valuation, still make it a company worth owning.
Samsung¡¦s mobile division, dominated by smartphones, brought in more than two-thirds of the company¡¦s operating profit last year, up from just around a quarter in 2010. Yet that era of smartphone dominance was short lived. The mobile division was likely the main culprit behind the company¡¦s forecast for a 60% decline in third-quarter operating profit. Shares are down nearly 20% this year.
There seems little prospect of a smartphone turnaround in the near future, given intense competition at the high end from Apple. At the low end is heat from Chinese handset makers who rely on the same Android operating system Samsung uses.
The outlook is less gloomy for Samsung¡¦s components businesses. In memory chips, it is the leader in both technology and in terms of scale in an industry once riven by competition, but now consolidated to just a handful of profitable players.
In logic chips, Samsung lost a major customer when Apple switched over to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for its iPhones. But Samsung is ahead of TSMC in the next generation of smaller-transistor chips, and analysts predict it will win back some Apple orders next year. Similarly in displays, Samsung is at the technological forefront with organic light-emitting diode technology.
The stock looks cheap at eight times forward earnings and 1.1 times book value, below the 10-year averages of 10 times earnings and 1.7 times book. Back out $44.4 billion of net cash, and it trades at just six times forward earnings.
Even assuming Samsung¡¦s mobile business is worthless, which it isn¡¦t, the stock looks undervalued. Putting the chip business at two times book value¡Xa discount to rivals, who trade at an average of nearly three times¡Xand adding Samsung¡¦s cash and investments, leaves a higher valuation than the current market capitalization, notes Mark Newman of Bernstein Research.
In fact, Samsung has been cheap, at around eight times earnings or below, since the middle of 2012, even before the smartphone business peaked. What is missing is a catalyst to unlock value.
Investors have agitated for the company to return more of its massive cash reserves to boost the stock. Samsung had hinted for months that it would unveil a detailed plan to send more cash to shareholders with its first-half results, only to backtrack in July, saying it needed more time.
This foot-dragging is partially explained by the stock¡¦s true problem: the convoluted structure through which the Lee family controls the broader Samsung empire. Since family patriarch Lee Kun-hee was hospitalized with a heart attack earlier this year, his children appear to have started work on an opaque plan to rearrange assets.
One likely objective is to consolidate control over crown jewel Samsung Electronics, in which Lee family members hold only a small direct stake. This means they would benefit little from a distribution of cash to shareholders before the reshuffle. Similarly, Mr. Lee¡¦s heirs face a 50% inheritance tax on his stake in Electronics. There is little incentive for them to boost the share price beforehand.
Samsung¡¦s smartphone woes look set to continue. But bright prospects for its other business aren¡¦t reflected in the share price. For now, investors will have to wait for that value to be unlocked by the Lee family.

* Q3 revenue rises 6.4 pct
* Revenue boosted in part by iPhone 6 launch- Analysts
* Laird says expectations for full year unchanged
* Shares rise as much as 4.4 pct (Adds analyst comments, details, share movement)
Oct 22 (Reuters) - Laird Plc, a British electronic components maker, said third-quarter revenue rose 6.4 percent, driven by increased business from customers launching new products, selling more smartphones and investing in 4G LTE networks.
The company's shares rose as much as 4.5 percent to rank among the top percentage gainers on the FTSE 250 index on Wednesday morning.
Laird, whose customers include Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, said trading was in line and its expectations for the full year remained unchanged.
Revenue in the quarter rose to 150 million pounds from 141 million pounds a year earlier.
The revenue boost was mainly due to growth at its performance materials division, which makes products to ward off electromagnetic interference, manage heat dissipation and maintain signal quality in mobile phones and other electronics.
The division gained from Apple's iPhone 6 launch, share gains at Samsung and continued investment in LTE in China, Liberum analysts wrote in a note to clients.
Revenue from the business rose 8 percent to 101 million pounds, while Laird's wireless systems division, which makes antennas and remote control systems, saw a 3 percent rise in revenue.
Laird, which also makes smart chips for GPS and radio systems in cars, said the rise in wireless revenue was in part due to increased demand for its telematics products from the automotive market, particularly in North America.
The smaller signal-integrity business declined from a year earlier when the Xbox gaming console sales peaked, Liberum analysts said.

HitachiMaxell cuts profit forecast, reduces headcount in battery unit

TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Hitachi Maxell Ltd cut its annual operating profit forecast by 40 percent to 5.1 billion yen ($48 million) on Wednesday and said it would reduce headcount in its lithium ion battery business after high-end smartphone sales sagged.               
The Japanese electronics maker, which supplies lithium ion batteries for Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's  smartphones, said it would offer voluntary retirement packages to 130 staff over 40-years old at the end of Feb 2015 and outsource an increased proportion of batteries after that.               
Samsung's July-September profit was the lowest in more than three years and the company said in early October that short-term prospects for its smartphones remained uncertain, as its sales are undercut by Chinese makers at the low end of the market and squeezed at the high end by Apple Inc.               
HitachiMaxell company left its net profit outlook at 6.75 billion yen and said it would pay a dividend of 31.5 yen for the first half after previously leaving the amount unclear. It also cut its full-year forecast by 7.8 percent to 154 billion yen.               
The company's shares closed 2.2 percent higher at 1,726 yen,  a level that was 16.6 percent lower than its offering price when it relisted in March. HitachiMaxell was spun off from Hitachi Ltd after becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2010.

* Q3 operating profit rises 21.8 pct y/y, beats estimates
* Tips Q4 profit to improve sequentially
SEOUL, Oct 22 (Reuters) - LG Display Co Ltd's July-September operating profit rose to its highest level in nearly two years, backed by healthy demand for television panels as well as the release of Apple Inc's new iPhone models.
The world's top liquid crystal display (LCD) maker had tipped both shipments and average selling price for LCDs to pick up sequentially during the third quarter, when analysts believed the company would benefit from a jump in orders as Apple readied the launch of its new larger-screen smartphones.
LG Display, which also counts sister company LG Electronics Inc as a major client, said LCD shipment volume for the third quarter rose from a year earlier though the average selling price for panels fell in annual terms.
For July-September, LG Display reported a 21.8 percent rise in operating profit to 474 billion won ($450.98 million). That compared with a 442 billion won mean estimate of 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S and marked the strongest level since the fourth quarter of 2012. Revenue fell 0.5 percent on year to 6.5 trillion won.
"In the third quarter, panel prices showed an upward trend as a tight supply situation continued due to increased demand for large-size panels," LG Display Chief Financial Officer Don Kim said in a statement.
LG Display said it expects fourth-quarter profit to improve sequentially, forecasting mid single-digit percentage rate panel shipment growth from July-September. Average selling price for panels is likely to remain stable in October-December from the previous quarter, it said.
Researcher WitsView said that August's large-sized panel shipments grew 5.6 percent from the previous month thanks in part to robust TV panel demand and tipped for further growth in September, indicating favourable conditions for panel makers.
Analysts also said that global shipments of ultra-high definition televisions, a premium product with significantly higher picture quality and fatter profit margins, also remain robust, lending support to panel makers such as LG Display.
Market dynamics are expected to remain favourable for LG Display. Analysts said that supply remains tight for TVs partly because of stronger demand for larger-sized panels, which is reducing production supply for certain mid-sized panels.
Orders for Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are expected to ramp up further in the fourth quarter following the launch of the devices in China, the world's largest smartphone market.
Researcher NPD DisplaySearch tips fourth-quarter panel shipments for the two iPhone models to rise to 75 million from 41 million in the July-September quarter.
Shares of LG Display closed 2.9 percent higher before the earnings release, compared with a 1.1 percent rise in the benchmark Kospi share index. (1 US dollar = 1,051.0500 Korean won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Christopher Cushing)

Corporate News: ICloud Hit by Attack in China --- Apple Warns of 'Organized' Efforts Aimed at Obtaining Users' Passwords, Data
673 words

Apple Inc.'s iCloud service for users in mainland China has been hit by an attack that could allow perpetrators to intercept and see usernames, passwords and other personal data, activists and security analysts said.
Though the perpetrator's identity was unclear, the attack came as tensions between the U.S. and Chinese governments have simmered over accusations of cyberespionage and hacking attacks. The online censorship watchdog GreatFire.org claimed Chinese authorities were behind the attack, though other experts said the source couldn't be determined.
A spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry said she was unaware of the matter and reiterated Beijing's position that it opposes cyberattacks.
Apple said in a statement on its website that it is aware of "intermittent organized network attacks" aimed at obtaining user information from iCloud.com. Apple said the attacks don't compromise the company's iCloud servers and don't affect iCloud sign-in on Apple devices running its iOS mobile software or Macs running OS X Yosemite using its Safari browser.
Apple said users should not sign into iCloud.com if they receive a warning from their browser that it is not a trusted site. This suggests that the user has been compromised.
Apple didn't mention China in its statement.
Concerns about the iCloud service in China began to emerge over the weekend when tech-savvy Chinese Internet users -- seeing warning messages on their Internet browsers -- raised suspicions in online discussion groups that the iCloud server's communications with users in China had been compromised.
Taiwan-based Chinese Internet activist Zhou Shuguang tested the service and found that communication channels between iCloud users and the iCloud server had been hijacked by an attacker in what is known as a "man-in-the-middle" tactic, Mr. Zhou said. Separately, Erik Hjelmvik, an analyst with Netresec AB, a network-security-software vendor in Sweden, said Tuesday he reviewed data posted online by Chinese Internet users and arrived at a similar conclusion.
"It's evident that it's quite massive," Mr. Hjelmvik said. He said the perpetrators were able to attack users in different parts of China who used different Internet service providers. "The attack was quite sophisticated in that they apparently have quite a huge system set up in order to be able to intercept on such a large scale."
The attack meant unauthorized parties would be able to decrypt the communication between iCloud users and the server, analysts said. This puts the iCloud users' usernames, passwords, files, pictures and contacts at risk of being seen unencrypted.
Activists like GreatFire.org accused the Chinese government of the attack. But some security analysts raised skepticism that Beijing, with sizable resources at its disposal, would order an attack that is so easily detected.
"This doesn't seem like the sort of attack an adversary with the resources of a government would attempt, since connecting users would see a very obvious security warning from their browser. It's more likely the sort of attack you'd see from someone with limited resources," said Kevin Milner, a researcher working on Internet infrastructure security at Oxford University.
The attack is the latest blow to Apple after a leak of celebrity photos from its iCloud system last month raised concerns about whether the service provides sufficient security.
Analysts pointed out that the reports of the attack surfaced around the time of the launch in China of Apple's latest iPhone, equipped with stronger encryption. In the wake of revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, Apple said it would use encryption on its phones that would prevent law enforcement from retrieving data on them.
Similar attacks have been reported in recent months affecting Chinese-based users accessing Google Inc. through a particular network, as well as Microsoft Corp.'s Hotmail services. Google and Microsoft didn't respond to requests for comment.

GT ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES
Agreement With Apple
allows Sale of Furnaces
GT Advanced Technologies has signed a pact with Apple Inc. for an "amicable parting of the ways," Luc Despins, attorney for the bankrupt supplier to the technology giant, said Tuesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Hampshire.
Apple was involved in a $578 million financing arrangement that set GT Advanced up in the business of making the synthetic sapphire-screen material. Instead of GT Advanced's sapphire, Apple sent the new generation of iPhones out with screens made from a Corning Inc. material.
Mr. Despins said the proposed settlement allows GT Advanced to try to sell the furnaces at the Mesa, Ariz. sapphire-manufacturing facility, and give the money to Apple, which financed the equipment. GT Advanced would surrender its claims against Apple, under the deal, and agree not to disparage the technology giant, he said.
Mr. Despins said GT Advanced and Apple have agreed to file a revised explanation for GT Advanced's surprise bankruptcy filing as part of the pact, and ultimately erase from the public record the court papers that set out what went wrong in the relationship between the two companies.
An Apple representative couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Apple has filed papers under seal in the case.

EMC
Cisco to Sell Portion
Of Stake in VCE Venture
EMC Corp. plans to buy a portion of Cisco Systems Inc.'s stake in a joint venture company called VCE that sells computing gear to corporate customers, people familiar with the matter said.
EMC will pay Cisco a "de minimus" amount for the portion of its stake, one person said. Spokesmen for EMC and Cisco declined to comment.
EMC posted an alert Tuesday stating it would hold a call with news media Wednesday morning to discuss a "new business development."
VCE, an acronym that stands for virtual computing environment, was established in 2009 with investors that also included VMware Inc. and Intel Corp.
Bloomberg reported news of the transaction between EMC and Cisco earlier Tuesday.

Samsung Electronics Co. said the U.S. National Security Agency approved several of its mobile devices for use by government officials to carry classified information, a positive step for the smartphone maker's struggling mobile division.
The development comes as Samsung continues to work slowly but persistently to boost its appeal in the enterprise market by clearing the technological hurdles to ready Galaxy devices for corporate and government customers with high-security needs.
Samsung said on Tuesday that the NSA approved the Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note 3 smartphones and the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, among others, for use. On the same list of approved devices is Boeing Co.'s Boeing Black phone.

Despite the improved retail sales, Harley's profit fell 7.8% in the third quarter to $150.1 million, or 69 cents a share, down from $162.7 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue, including financial services, slipped 3.1% to $1.30 billion.

Careers: Bosses Seek Critical Thinking, but What Is It? --- Employers Stumble When Asked to Describe the Skills They Seek, Leaving Job Hunters Wondering What Employers Want
By Melissa Korn

22 October 2014

Critical thinking is a critical skill for young workers these days.
What that means, though -- and how to measure it -- is less clear. Employers complain that colleges are not producing graduates who can solve problems and connect the dots on complex issues, but bosses stumble when pressed to describe exactly what skills make critical thinkers. That leaves job seekers wondering what employers really want and, once on the job, unsure of whether they're supposed to follow the rules or break them.
Mentions of critical thinking in job postings have doubled since 2009, according to an analysis by career-search site Indeed.com. The site, which combs job ads from several sources, found last week that more than 21,000 health-care and 6,700 management postings contained some reference to the skill.
"It's one of those words -- like diversity was, like big data is -- where everyone talks about it but there are 50 different ways to define it," says Dan Black, Americas director of recruiting at the accounting firm and consultancy EY.
Brittany Holloway, a music-business major who graduated last spring from New York University, says critical thinking appeared in so many postings during her job search that it, along with traits like "detail-oriented" and "organized," was nearly meaningless. Only in interviews could she tell what a company meant when it sought those traits.
Ms. Holloway, who now works as a content-review and fraud specialist at Brooklyn-based digital-music distributor TuneCore, defines the skill as "forming your own opinion from a variety of different sources."
Ms. Holloway, 21 years old, says her current job requires her to think critically when screening music releases before they're sent to digital stores like Apple Inc.'s iTunes.
Behavioral interview prompts, such as "Talk about how you handled working with a difficult person," help EY bosses assess critical-thinking skills, says Mr. Black. (His definition: "The ability to work with data, to accumulate it, analyze it [and] synthesize it, in order to make balanced assessments and smart decisions.")
In late-round interviews, candidates must show how they would tackle business problems, such as whether it makes more sense for a company to make or buy a product, and why.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asks investment-banking and sales-and-trading candidates to assess company valuations and stock pitches and then to explain how they arrived at their conclusions.
By the end of one of those exercises, "the candidates should have displayed whether they possess critical thinking," says Michael Desmarais, global head of recruiting for the bank.
Critical thinking may be similar to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's famous threshold for obscenity: You know it when you see it, says Jerry Houser, associate dean and director of career services at Willamette University in Salem, Ore.
When recruiters tell Mr. Houser they want students with problem-solving skills, "that usually has something to do with critical thinking," he says. His office encourages students to prepare stories to illustrate their critical-thinking prowess, detailing, for example, the steps a club president took to improve attendance at weekly meetings.
Colleges' capacity to mold thinkers has been a topic of heated debate. Richard Arum, co-author of "Academically Adrift" and "Aspiring Adults Adrift" as well as an NYU sociology professor, is a prominent critic of how schools are faring on that front.
"Schools have institutionally supported and encouraged [a] retreat from academic standards and rigor," he says, adding that he thinks colleges have allowed students to focus on their social lives at the expense of academic pursuits.
According to research detailed in those books, students rarely study on their own for more than an hour a day, and most don't write in-depth papers that require sustained analysis.
For their part, students seem to think they are ready for the office. But their future bosses tend to disagree. A Harris Interactive survey of 2,001 U.S. college students and 1,000 hiring managers last fall found that 69% of students felt they were "very or completely prepared" for problem-solving tasks in the workplace, while fewer than half of the employers agreed.
Judy Nagengast, CEO of Continental Inc., an Anderson, Ind., staffing firm, says she has come across young graduates who "can memorize and they can regurgitate" but who struggle to turn book learning into problem solving at work.
Ms. Nagengast says she grew frustrated with young accountants who didn't understand the importance of accuracy on tax forms and filed "B-minus financial statements." She wants and needs to recruit young workers, though, and she is testing the waters with a fresh graduate who's handling the firm's compliance with the Affordable Care Act.
Linda Elder, an educational psychologist and the president of the Foundation for Critical Thinking, which promotes educational reform, says employers really want well-trained problem solvers and not critical thinkers, especially in the lower ranks. Critical thinkers, she says, tend to challenge the status quo, which isn't always what a boss is after.
At Goldman, "we don't expect new hires to propose changes to our chairman or board on a firm-wide strategy level on Day One," says Mr. Desmarais. But the bank's entry-level hires are expected to do more than just fulfill orders, he adds. "We do encourage our junior people to recommend changes."

Technisys Raises Banking Funding
By Lizette Chapman

A startup that powers Latin American banks delivering services to people via mobile, ATMs, and online has secured $13 million in Series B funding from investors including Intel Capital.
Miami-based Technisys SA, founded in 1996, employs 300. It has grown as the region's middle class has exploded, with clients including Citibank, Banco Itau, Banco Estado de Chile and Banco Original seeking to reach customers through multiple channels for services including savings, payments and loans. The company is tracking to do $30 million in revenue this year.
"The banks should be reaching the customer in a holistic way. That means allowing them to connect via the Web, tablet, ATMs, smartphones and new wearable devices," Technisys Chief Executive Miguel Santos said.
Technisys, like legacy players SAP and Oracle Corp., unifies the information siloed within those applications and gives banks a more streamlined way to securely interact with customers.
The role of banks in Latin America, where some 60% of adults don't have accounts, according to a 2012 study by the World Bank, is at an interesting juncture. Along with facing competition from major retailers like Wal-Mart offering in-store banking services, startups such as Boku Inc. and Mopay AG and services Google Wallet and Apple Pay make it easy for consumers to pay for goods and services with their mobile phones.
Intel Capital Vice President and General Manager for Latin America Steve Long said he met Mr. Santos more than a year ago. He said there was a large opportunity in financial services, and he believes Technisys is well positioned to succeed.
"Banks need solutions that enhance [the] banking experience across channels, increasing revenue opportunities and customer loyalty," Mr. Long said. "Digital channel convergence, which represents the main focus for Technisys, is one of the most relevant trends in digital banking today."
Alta Venture, KaSZeK Ventures, Endeavor Catalyst and existing investor Holdinvest also contributed. The company previously raised $1 million from Holdinvest.
Mr. Santos expanded the financing round's $8 million initial target to $13 million to get additional investors.

* Won up on exporters, offshore funds
    * Rupiah eases on importers, traders book profits
 (Adds text, updates prices)
    By Jongwoo Cheon
    SINGAPORE, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Most emerging Asian currencies
edged up on Wednesday as regional stocks advanced and sentiment
improved, with the European Central Bank seen readying to launch
its plan to buy corporate bonds.
    South Korea's won gained on demand from exporters
for month-end settlements and as some offshore funds bought the
currency.
    Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose
nearly 1 percent, tracking higher U.S. stocks after
stronger-than-expected earnings from Apple Inc and
Texas Instruments Inc.
    Risk appetite improved as the ECB is considering buying
corporate bonds on the secondary market and may decide on the
matter as soon as December, several sources told Reuters.
 
    Emerging Asian currencies, however, failed to fully benefit
from strong equity performances and the ECB's stimulus plan as
the dollar broadly rose against a basket of major
currencies.
    "Any rebound in Asian currencies is unlikely to last long,"
said Jeong My-young, Samsung Futures' research head in Seoul.
    "Given differentials in economic fundamentals and interest
rates, the dollar's strong trend will sustain."
    
    RUPIAH
    The rupiah eased on dollar demand from importers for
month-end payments.
    Traders booked profits from gains in the currency, which on
Tuesday hit its strongest in about four weeks.
    The official Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR),
which the central bank launched last year in an effort to manage
exchange rate fluctuations, was fixed at 12,026 rupiah per
dollar, weaker than Tuesday's 11,993.

SYDNEY -  London copper paused for breath on Wednesday after lodging its biggest one-day advance in two months on prospects of fresh easing in Europe and further signs of economic revival in the United States.               
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange  traded flat at $6,668 a tonne by 0038 GMT after a 1.6 percent gain in the previous session, its biggest one-day rise since Aug. 20. Prices are still down more than 9 percent this year.

OIL               
NEW YORK -  Brent crude oil ended up almost 1 percent on Tuesday, helped by data showing stronger-than-expected China demand and some technical price recovery after weeks of almost uninterrupted selling.               
Brent settled up 82 cents at $86.22 a barrel. It rose as much as $1.06, or 1.2 percent, during the session to $86.48. It rose more than 10 cents in post-settlement trade, reacting to the API data.

TOKYO, Oct 22 (IFR) - Japanese government bond prices inched down on Wednesday with the debt market weighed by a bounce in Tokyo stocks and overnight weakening by U.S. Treasuries.               
The benchmark 10-year JGB yield rose half a basis point to 0.480 percent.               
December 10-year JGB futures shed 0.02 point to 146.35.               
The Bank of Japan's regular bond-buying operation, through which it offered to purchase a total of 630 billion yen ($5.89 billion) of JGBs on Wednesday, helped limit the debt market's losses.               
Tokyo's Nikkei climbed 1.5 percent, buoyed after Wall Street rallied overnight on strong corporate results including Apple's.               
Treasuries dipped overnight after stronger-than-expected September home resales data and the Wall Street surge dented demand for safe-haven government bonds.

SYDNEY, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures fell on
Wednesday, edging away from a one-month peak touched in the
previous session as forecasts of favourable weather eased
concerns over harvest delays.
         
    FUNDAMENTALS  
    * Chicago Board of Trade front-month corn fell 0.3
percent to $3.55 a bushel, having gained 2.2 percent in the

a bushel.

a bushel, having firmed 1.8 percent on Wednesday.

marked a one-month high of $5.23-3/4 a bushel.
    * U.S. farmers had harvested 53 percent of their soybean
crop as of Sunday, up from 40 percent a week earlier but below
the five-year average of 66 percent, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said in a weekly crop report on Monday.
 
    * Rainy weather that slowed harvesting in the U.S. Midwest
this month also stalled the planting of winter wheat, a delay
that could threaten crop yields, experts said. 
    * Egypt, the world's top wheat importer, said on Tuesday it
had bought 180,000 tonnes of French, Romanian and Russian wheat
in an international tender.

a Reuters report that the European Central Bank is considering
buying corporate bonds, while recovery in risk appetite
underpinned the dollar against the yen.  
    * Brent crude oil ended up almost 1 percent on Tuesday,
helped by data showing stronger-than-expected China demand and
some technical price recovery after weeks of almost
uninterrupted selling.  
    * U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 notching
a fourth straight session of gains boosted by strong corporate

No Whiplash as China Slows
Don't look for China to derail the global economy just yet.
Official figures show China grew 7.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest rate since the financial crisis, but far from a hard landing.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, it expanded an annualized 7.8%, a slowdown from the previous quarter's 8.2% rate, but still faster than earlier this year. Those looking for a collapse of the Chinese economy will continue to wait.
The all-important property market remains troubled, but has avoided a free fall. Sales declined 10% in September from the year earlier. That isn't as bad as the previous two months, possibly a mild reaction to a number of stimulus measures the government has unveiled such as cheaper mortgages and removal of restrictions on speculators.
Yet any real-estate recovery will likely be tepid, as unsold inventories continue to expand, up 28% from a year earlier, and prices continue to fall.
Other figures show the economy holding up despite property-market problems. Though still among the weakest readings of the past five years, industrial-production growth recovered to 8% in September from 6.9% in August. Retail sales, adjusted for inflation, expanded 10.8% in September, compared with 10.6% in August.
For deflation worriers in the U.S., China's slowdown adds to the hand-wringing, as its exports to the U.S. will stay cheap. Yet there also are benefits from China's industrial-led slowdown. Prime among them is the self-correcting stimulus to the world provided by weak oil prices. That is one kind of deflation that has typically been a benefit to the U.S. economy.
Another silver lining for the U.S. is that China's demand for services -- outside those related to real estate -- remains healthy. Services now account for over one-quarter of what the U.S. sells to China, up from 15% in 2006. While coal miners don't much like China's industrial slowdown, Hollywood, lawyers, consultants and travel-related businesses should continue to find a robust market there.
Beijing has guided the economy with dribs and drabs of stimulus in the past few months, providing just enough support to ensure a gentle descent. It has resisted broad-based interest-rate cuts, wanting to avoid a return to the old debt-fueled growth playbook. With the government's view on labor markets still optimistic, it will take more evidence of the property market infecting the financial system and overall economy for Beijing's approach to change.
Given the fragile situation in Europe and other emerging markets, it is natural for investors to also fret about China. But for now, a stable slowdown hardly makes China the worst of the world's worries.
-- Alex Frangos
The ECB's Shopping List
Doesn't Stop Expanding
It still is all about the central banks.
That much is clear from the reaction to a report Tuesday that the European Central Bank could decide as soon as December to buy corporate bonds. In short order, the euro fell half a cent against the dollar, stocks and Southern European government-bond prices jumped and the cost to insure investment-grade corporate debt fell. The ECB said no decisions had been taken.
The ECB has been careful not to rule out further stimulus measures beyond those already announced. But the market believes the ECB will have trouble lifting its balance sheet back to the size it was in 2012 -- implying an expansion of 650 billion euros to 1 trillion euros ($832 billion to $1.28 trillion) -- by targeting these instruments. Buying eurozone government bonds is clearly a last-resort option, such a move being politically controversial and practically difficult.
Buying corporate bonds could give the ECB a big market to target; there are 710 billion euros of securities in the Markit iBoxx nonfinancial senior corporate bond index, and issuance is plentiful. And such a move, while radical, isn't beyond the pale. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan both have bought corporate debt.
But there clearly are risks. First, the ECB already has its hands full. It only started buying covered bonds on Monday and will be handing out fresh loans to banks in December. To throw corporate bonds into the mix so quickly might show a lack of faith in the existing options, a bad signal to send.
Second, there is the question of what the ECB would hope to achieve with such purchases, beyond a short-term boost to market sentiment. The iBoxx nonfinancial index currently yields just 1.44%, down from 2.41% at the end of 2013.
And investment-grade companies have no trouble at all raising money. The bigger issue is whether they are willing to spend it. The ECB could make a difference by buying high-yield bonds, which could boost access to markets for smaller companies. But that is likely a step too far; the ECB already has been stung by criticism that asset-backed-bond purchases will load its balance sheet with junk.
Third, even with a large market, it isn't clear the ECB could expand its balance sheet quickly. Investors may not be willing to sell, as they would face a reinvestment headache. Indeed, that is one reason for the resilience of Europe's corporate-bond market in the current turmoil.
J.P. Morgan Chase economists suggest purchases could reach 50 billion euros over one year, extending to 100 billion euros if market turnover rises. Given a 2 trillion-plus euro balance sheet, that is relatively small.
Despite this, such actions, even if small, ultimately could crowd investors into riskier assets such as stocks. The aim would be to lift prices elsewhere, sparking some confidence that leads to renewed investing and lending. But that may be less effective in Europe than in the U.S., as the continent relies on the banking system to provide financing more than capital markets.
Still, the ECB is facing a clamor for market action that is only getting louder and economic data that is getting worse. Absent unified thinking and action on Europe's fiscal front, the central bank may have little choice but to stay at the center of the action.
-- Richard Barley
Apple's Big Screen Shot
Apple's newest iPhones may not bend easily, but they have tweaked the company's business enough to merit attention -- in a good way.
The company Monday delivered strong results for its fiscal fourth quarter, fueled mainly by better-than-expected sales of the iPhone. Apple launched two new models in the final weeks of the quarter ending in September, enough to boost unit sales by 16%, year over year.
Notably, the average selling price for the smartphone rose to an estimated $603, up more than 4% year over year.
This shouldn't be ignored. Apple is famous for keeping its product offerings simple. Yet its transformation into one to the world's largest tech companies has demanded a more complex approach.
Launching one new smartphone a year wasn't cutting it, as customers were demanding more variety in screen sizes and design. Adding the megasize iPhone 6 Plus this year gave Apple a needed offering in the so-called phablet category that has proved a draw for many consumers.
Another gambit appears to have paid off as well: Apple dropped 32-gigabyte iPhones from its newest offerings, offering 64-gigabyte versions at the same price. Some worried that this -- along with the larger screens -- would depress profitability. But the company's overall gross margin came in at 38% for the quarter, a percentage point higher than last year's launch period of the iPhone 5s and 5c models.
The strong results bode well for Apple going into the December period, which will include more markets for the iPhone -- including China. Wall Street is projecting iPhone unit sales to rise 20% year over year for that period. That looks achievable.
The potential for the Apple Watch that goes on sale next year remains a question mark, as does its newly launched payments service, Apple Pay.
Even so, the stock remains valued at about 14 times earnings -- a bargain given Apple's ability to upsell its flagship product.
