SHANGHAI, Nov 7 (Reuters) - China shares rose on Friday, buoyed by strength in brokerages as investors regained confidence after the Chinese central bank pumped liquidity into the financial system to help the economy.               
The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.6 percent to a 20-month high of 2,440.3 points by midday, while the CSI300  of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings gained 0.8 percent, to touch its highest since early June last year.               
For the week, the mainland indexes are set to climb 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, which would mark a second straight week of gains.               
The central bank said on Thursday that it had pumped 769.5 billion yuan ($125.8 billion) worth of three-month loans into banks via a "medium-term lending facility" (MLF) to keep interest rates low.               
Analysts said the move by the central bank could help to  boost stock investors' confidence as well.               
"I've seen investors are confident to buy into those low-valuation heavyweight stocks," said Du Changchun, analyst at Northeast Securities in Shanghai, adding that strong performance by blue chips would provide key support for the index.               
Brokerage stocks bolstered the main indexes, with Huatai Securities Co Ltd rising 8.3 percent, while Industrial Securities Co Ltd hit its 10 percent daily limit.               
Haitong Securities Co Ltd and CITIC Securities Co Ltd, the country's top two brokerage firms, rose 5.3 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively.               
Other financials also outperformed, with the CSI300 financials sub-index firming 2 percent to hit its best level since Sept. 2013. The SSEC financials sub-index  rose 1.7 percent.               
China Life Insurance Co Ltd and China Citic Bank Corp Ltd both gained 2 percent.                              
HONG KONG MIXED               
Hong Kong shares reversed early losses by midday, as a strong brokerage sector helped temper selling pressure.               
The Hang Seng Index was up 0.1 percent at 23,682.6 points. The China Enterprises Index of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong gained 1.0 percent.               
For the week, the two indexes were down 1.3 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.               
Analyst said investor were taking profits from the market after previous rallies.               
Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai securities in Hong Kong, said the current reporting season posed no surprise as most blue chip companies had reported earnings within market expectations.               
Brokerage shares rose, led by CITIC Securities  which announced solid October net profit on Thursday. Shares of CITIC Securities were up 5.3 percent and Haitong International  rose 4.1 percent.               
The information technology sector was the biggest loser. Lenovo extended losses from Thursday despite reporting a 19 percent jump in net income in the second fiscal quarter, but revenue fell short of analyst expectations.               
Tencent Holdings Ltd shed 0.3 percent after the company signed a commitment to "self-manage" comments on its website together with 28 Chinese video portals.               
Ping An Insurance Group, China's second largest insurer, halted trading on Friday morning.

Nov 6 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc plans to open an office in Hong Kong early next year to serve greater China and tap advertising revenue from Chinese companies, the Wall Street Journal reported.               
The office is set to open in the first quarter of 2015 and will mainly house sales staff, Shailesh Rao, Twitter's vice president for Asia Pacific, the Americas and emerging markets, told The Wall Street Journal. (http://on.wsj.com/1vRPuYi)               
Twitter has been blocked by Chinese censors since 2009.               
Even if it does not establish an official presence in China, Twitter has avenues to make money from China. For instance, Twitter's subsidiary MoPub, which serves up ads inside mobile apps, counts many small Chinese app developers among its customers, while Beijing-based PC-maker Lenovo Group Ltd  is an advertiser on Twitter itself.

Twitter to Open Office in Hong Kong

SINGAPORE¡XTwitter Inc. plans to open an office in Hong Kong early next year to serve greater China and tap advertising revenues from Chinese companies that are quickly expanding, an executive said.
Shailesh Rao, Twitter¡¦s vice president for Asia Pacific, the Americas and emerging markets, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview that the office will mainly house sales staff, though he declined to say how many. The office is set to open in the first quarter of 2015.
¡§The real main focus of the office will be sales,¡¨ Mr. Rao said. ¡§Building sales capability to work with agencies and advertisers domestically in Hong Kong and Taiwan and those Chinese advertisers looking to go global.¡¨
Twitter has been blocked in China since 2009 due to government concerns it could be used to organize protests. Asked if plans for the Hong Kong office signaled Twitter¡¦s eagerness to enter China should the government lift its restriction, Mr. Rao said, ¡§We would love to have Twitter¡¨ reach people ¡§everywhere in the world including China.¡¨ But, he added, ¡§Unfortunately, we can¡¦t. That¡¦s not our choice. We don¡¦t control that decision.¡¨
A year after its initial public offering, Twitter last week said its third-quarter revenue more than doubled to $361 million. But the company¡¦s user growth slowed again after gaining momentum in recent quarters, sparking concern among investors. The company has yet to turn a profit.
While 77% of the San Francisco-based company¡¦s 284 million users are outside the U.S., the company derives just 34% of its revenue internationally, though that percentage has been rising in recent quarters.
The Hong Kong office will be headed by Peter Greenberger, Twitter¡¦s Singapore-based director of sales for emerging markets. Mr. Greenberger earlier led Twitter¡¦s Washington, D.C. sales team focusing on political campaigns.
Twitter in August said it would open an office in Jakarta to work more closely with advertisers and marketers in Indonesia, which analysts say is one of its biggest markets. That office has yet to open.
The company has an office in Singapore, which opened last year, and elsewhere in the Asian-Pacific region maintains offices in Seoul, Tokyo and Sydney.
Meanwhile, Google Inc. has an office in Hong Kong, as does Facebook Inc., whose co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, last month visited Beijing and delivered a speech in Chinese. Like Twitter, both Google and Facebook offer services that are also blocked in China.
Mr. Rao called the blockbuster $25 billion initial public offering in September by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., China¡¦s largest e-commerce company, significant because it signals Chinese companies¡¦ desire to become global players. That could be good news for Twitter, which derives most of its revenue from advertising.
Mr. Rao said Chinese smartphone makers Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Inc., as well as computer and phone maker Lenovo Group Ltd., are ¡§poised for global expansion¡¨ along with Alibaba. He also highlighted Taiwanese personal-computer makers Acer Inc. and Asustek Computer Inc., known to many consumers as Asus.

China¡¦s  Lenovo  Readies Phone Push Abroad; Computer Maker to Use Motorola Mobility Deal as Springboard; Profit Climbs 19%

Lenovo Group Ltd., the world¡¦s biggest computer maker by shipments and a rising power in smartphones, said it is hoping to expand its handset business rapidly abroad, now that its purchase of handset maker Motorola Mobility has closed.
The Chinese technology company, which officially took over Motorola from previous owner Google Inc. last week, said Thursday that growing sales of computers and smartphones already were responsible for a 19% rise in net profit to $262 million and a 7% rise in revenue to $10.48 billion during the quarter ended in September. Smartphone shipments rose 38% compared with a year earlier.
Those results didn¡¦t include the performances at Motorola or International Business Machines Corp.¡¦s server unit, which also became a Lenovo subsidiary last month.
With the addition of Motorola¡¦s operations, Lenovo- and Motorola-branded smartphones have a combined 7.8% share of global shipments, boosting Lenovo to No. 3 behind Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc., from No. 4, Lenovo said. In the U.S., where Lenovo hasn¡¦t sold phones under its own brand, Motorola¡¦s share of the smartphone market more than doubled in the latest quarter to propel the Chinese company to No. 4, close behind LG Electronics Inc., Lenovo said. Lenovo¡¦s immediate goal in the U.S. is to jump to No. 3 and threaten the leadership of Samsung and Apple, the company said. Samsung and LG are based in South Korea.
Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo¡¦s chief executive, has said that he wants the company to become the No. 1 smartphone maker in the world.
Lenovo¡¦s global mobile ambitions are another sign of the shifting power balance in the cutthroat smartphone industry, where market leaders Samsung and Apple are facing new challenges from low-cost competitors, mostly Chinese. Lenovo has a thriving global personal-computer business, but in handsets it has largely grown share at home, selling inexpensive but good-quality phones in the booming Chinese market along with domestic rivals such as Xiaomi Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co.
Now growth in China is slowing, and the Chinese companies are looking abroad.
¡§China¡¦s [smartphone] market is saturated,¡¨ and growth is likely to slow, Mr. Yang said Thursday. ¡§To win, you have to become a global player.¡¨
The Motorola acquisition gives Lenovo a leg up not only in the U.S. but in other mature markets, where the U.S. handset maker has strong relationships with carriers and its intellectual property can help defend it against patent lawsuits. Motorola¡¦s handsets¡Xwhich are positioned as higher-end phones than Lenovo¡¦s¡Xalso have a higher gross margin, or profit after deducting the cost of goods sold, Mr. Yang said.
Despite that higher margin, Motorola¡¦s handsets aren¡¦t profitable, in part because the company¡¦s costs are high, analysts say. But Mr. Yang repeated his forecast that Motorola would be back in the black in six months, after it combines forces with Lenovo to make its phones more cost-effectively.
Lenovo¡¦s mobile engineers are spending a lot of time with their Motorola counterparts to exchange ideas on new products and technologies, some of which might be unveiled next spring, said Mr. Yang, without disclosing details.
Motorola is discussing whether and how to use Lenovo¡¦s factories to manufacture some of its phones, which would raise the factories¡¦ utilization rate and help reduce costs, Motorola President Rick Osterloh said in a recent interview. By sharing Lenovo¡¦s vast supply chain for smartphones, tablet computers and PCs, Motorola could win better deals for components such as screens and camera modules that could help differentiate its smartphones¡¦ features without raising their prices¡Xsomething that wasn¡¦t possible when its market share was tiny, analysts say.
¡§Lenovo can help us expand in ways that Google cannot,¡¨ said Mr. Osterloh. ¡§The major difference is that we are going to be part of a company that really understands hardware.¡¨
Lenovo is also preparing to reintroduce Motorola handsets to China, where the U.S. company hasn¡¦t sold phones since 2012. Mr. Yang said Motorola has a significant opportunity in China, because it can position itself as one of a handful of high-end brands.
¡§In the premium segment, there are only two players, Apple and Samsung,¡¨ and Motorola can be another one, Mr. Yang said in an interview. ¡§Many people in China still remember the Motorola brand¡Kwe can reintroduce that brand,¡¨ he said.
Still, analysts say success for Lenovo and Motorola is far from guaranteed, and they will face tougher competition from market leader Samsung, which will likely become more aggressive in its attempt to regain lost ground.
¡§Samsung is not going to let Lenovo and Motorola continue to steal its market share,¡¨ said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Alberto Moel. The South Korean smartphone company will likely launch more affordable models in emerging markets to better compete against Lenovo, he said.

 Lenovo ¡¦s Quarterly Profit Jumps 19%; Growth in Europe Helps the PC Maker Shrug Off Declining Revenue in China

HONG KONG¡XLenovo Group Ltd. said Thursday its net profit for the quarter through September rose 19% thanks to growing sales of both personal computers and smartphones.
The world¡¦s largest PC maker by shipments said net profit rose to $262 million from $220 million a year earlier, largely in line with analysts¡¦ expectations. Revenue, however, came in below analysts¡¦ projections, rising 7% to $10.48 billion from $9.77 billion.
Lenovo said revenue in China, its biggest market, decreased 2% in the quarter from a year earlier. But revenue in Europe rose 33%, making up for the slowdown in China.
The company¡¦s smartphone shipments rose 38% from a year earlier. But revenue from its mobile devices division, which also includes tablets, fell 6%.
Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said the decline in mobile device revenue, despite shipment growth, was partly because many of the phones shipped near the end of the quarter hadn¡¦t yet contributed to revenue.
Lenovo has a challenge integrating two businesses it bought recently. A week ago, the company said it completed its $2.91 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility from Google Inc., while earlier in October it closed a $2.1 billion deal to buy International Business Machines Corp.¡¦s low-end server business.
Analysts say Lenovo¡¦s earnings may be hurt in the coming quarters by costs associated with the integration of the two businesses. Mr. Yang Yuanqing has also warned that the acquisitions will likely weigh on the company¡¦s bottom line in the near term. Mr. Yang has said he aims to turn loss-making Motorola profitable within six quarters of completing the deal.
Lenovo, which was founded in China, bought IBM¡¦s PC business in 2005. The company, now based in both China and the U.S., overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. to become the world¡¦s No. 1 PC maker by shipments last year. As the global PC market has become saturated, Lenovo is seeking new sources of growth by expanding its smartphone and server businesses.
Separately, Lenovo said Thursday that it has appointed Yahoo Inc. co-founder Jerry Yang as an independent board director. Of Lenovo¡¦s 11-member board, eight are independent directors, including former Sony Corp. Chief Executive Nobuyuki Idei and Tudor Brown, a co-founder of U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings PLC.

Acer Reports Narrow Third-Quarter Profit on Cost Cuts; Revenue Continues to Fall Amid Global PC Slump

TAIPEI¡XTaiwanese personal-computer maker Acer Inc. reported a narrow profit for a third consecutive quarter after cost cuts, though revenue continued to fall as the global market for personal computers contracts.
Acer, the world¡¦s fourth-largest PC maker by shipments, has steadied its business this year with a new management team after three years of losses. The company was hit particularly hard as consumers shifted to mobile devices.
Acer posted a net profit of 651 million New Taiwan dollars (US$21.3 million) in the third quarter, versus a record NT$13.1 billion net loss a year ago. Revenue slid to NT$85.7 billion from NT$92.1 billion a year earlier.
Its operating margin was 1.3%, compared with 0.8% in the second quarter and negative 2.8% a year earlier.
Acer Chief Executive Jason Chen was recruited from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. at the beginning of the year, and has since cut costs, partly via layoffs and slashing executive salaries, to return the company to profit. He joined after Acer¡¦s top two executives resigned after taking responsibility for continued losses.
In the third quarter, Acer and other major PC players benefited from market consolidation as smaller competitors retreated from the market, according to market-research firm International Data Corp. Shipments grew for Acer and its larger rivals Lenovo Group Ltd., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. even as the total market shrank by 1.7%. Acer¡¦s market share grew to 8.4% from 7.4% a year earlier.
Steven Tseng, an analyst at Taiwanese brokerage Daiwa, said Acer has sold more low-cost Chromebooks this year than in the past, in an effort to boost volume and gain scale.
Acer¡¦s founder has said the company is developing cloud-computing services, and will begin selling at least one product next year. Analysts remain skeptical about its potential as an earnings contributor in the near future.
Acer also announced Thursday it promoted Jerry Kao to president of its core notebook business group, where he was a general manager. The notebook business had been overseen by Jackson Lin, chief technology officer and president of Acer¡¦s design center, who will now focus on research and development.

Xiaomi Makes a Profit on Its Cheap Smartphones; Chinese Tech Firm¡¦s Earnings Rose 84% Last Year

HONG KONG¡XChinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc., which was founded just four years ago, already is among the world¡¦s largest smartphone makers.
Now a confidential document viewed by The Wall Street Journal shows that Xiaomi¡¦s net profit nearly doubled last year, making it a lucrative business in an industry where most players selling cheap handsets struggle to break even.
Xiaomi, which a few months ago surpassed Samsung Electronics Co. as the biggest smartphone vendor in China by shipments, presented the document to banks in its recent pitch to raise $1 billion in loans for overseas expansion or acquisition.
A table in the document showed that Xiaomi¡¦s net profit last year rose 84% to 3.46 billion yuan ($566 million) from 1.88 billion yuan in 2012. Its revenue more than doubled to 27 billion yuan. Another table included a forecast of a 75% net profit increase this year.
A Xiaomi spokeswoman declined to comment.
Xiaomi¡¦s rapid growth and strong earnings are also part of broader changes in the smartphone market where Chinese players are greatly increasing their presence, challenging the dominance of Samsung and Apple Inc.
Over the past year, some of China¡¦s top smartphone vendors, such as Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co., have been expanding overseas, posing a threat to Samsung in Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets.
Xiaomi¡¦s profit flies in the face of many analysts¡¦ belief that the Chinese company¡¦s rock-bottom pricing for its phones to increase market share has come at the expense of profit.
Its cheapest phone, the Redmi 1S, starts at 699 yuan ($114), and its latest flagship model, the Mi4, starts at 1,999 yuan ($327).
A possible explanation for Xiaomi¡¦s ability to squeeze out so much profit while selling affordable phones is its inexpensive but efficient marketing tactics.
While established competitors spend heavily on TV commercials and other traditional forms of advertising, Xiaomi¡¦s marketing has centered on social media and Internet forums where many users post comments, complaints and requests.
In China, Xiaomi has expanded rapidly over the past few years by selling its phones online, relying on word-of-mouth among China¡¦s more than 600 million Internet users.
By interacting with users online and often tweaking its software and features based on their input, Xiaomi has built a loyal fan base in China. This strategy hasn¡¦t only proven effective in retaining users, but has also helped the company save on marketing cost, analysts say.
According to the document, Xiaomi spent 876 million yuan, or 3.2% of its revenue, on sales and marketing expenses last year. Its spending in 2012 was 416 million yuan, or 3.9% of its revenue.
After seeing the success of Xiaomi¡¦s marketing strategy, many other Chinese handset makers have started focusing more on online marketing, using social media as a way to engage with consumers.
The document also provided some details on how Xiaomi earns its revenue. Even though the company sells smartphone applications, other software and services, 94% of its revenue came from handset sales last year, according to the document. Sales of services such as mobile games accounted for only 1% of its revenue.
¡§Xiaomi has done a great job of growing smartphone shipments and profits simultaneously,¡¨ said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston. Still, analysts say it is unclear whether Xiaomi can sustain its profit margin, as China¡¦s smartphone market is becoming crowded and saturated.
As competition intensifies at home, Xiaomi has expanded overseas in Asian emerging markets such as India.
Despite its growth, Xiaomi will likely face many hurdles in its international expansion. In mature markets such as the U.S., where it is critical for smartphone makers to secure access to intellectual property to defend themselves from patent lawsuits, Xiaomi will likely have difficulties expanding unless it finds ways to boost its patent portfolio, analysts say.
To finance its expansion outside China, Xiaomi is currently seeking another round of equity fundraising, according to people familiar with the situation. The next round will likely give Xiaomi a much higher valuation than the previous rounds. In August 2013, Xiaomi said it raised a fourth round of funding that valued the firm at $10 billion, more than double its June 2012 valuation of $4 billion.
Xiaomi¡Xpronounced ¡§sheow-me¡¨¡Xwas founded in 2010 by Lei Jun, an entrepreneur who has been compared by Chinese media to Steve Jobs. Just a year into its existence, the company was already successful in creating a buzz around its products, starting with its social networking app called MiTalk, which attracted seven million users in two months.
When Xiaomi launched its first smartphone, the Mi1, in late 2011, the first batch of shipments¡X100,000 units¡Xsold out in less than three hours.
Xiaomi also runs its own mobile-app store, called the Mi Market, and offers a host of smartphone services such as games, social networking and cloud storage. It offers entertainment such as movies. Through its online store, the company sells accessories such as phone cases and dolls of its rabbit mascot.
Xiaomi¡¦s share of the global smartphone market rose to 5.3% in the third quarter, making it the third-largest smartphone maker after Samsung and Apple, according to a market-research firm IDC. In the coming quarters, Lenovo, whose market share in the quarter was almost the same as Xiaomi¡¦s, is expected to become the third-largest player, as it recently completed its acquisition of Motorola Mobility.

Nov 4 (Reuters) - Motorola Solutions Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as it slashed costs, and the maker of walkie-talkies and radio systems raised its share buyback authorization by $5 billion.
Motorola Solutions has about $600 million remaining from its earlier $7 billion buyback program, and the new authorization takes the total to $12 billion since July 2011.
The company's total operating expenses from continuing operations fell 9 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 27, Chief Financial Officer Gino A. Bonanotte said on a conference call.
Motorola said it expected to cut costs by more than $200 million in 2014 and was on track to save $300 million by the end of 2015.
The company's shares rose 2.8 percent to $66.50 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
Motorola, which completed the sale of its enterprise business to Zebra Technologies Corp for $3.45 billion in October, forecast a 1-3 percent fall in fourth-quarter sales due to weak government spending.
Sales to government agencies such as fire and police departments accounted for 69 percent of Motorola Solutions' sales in 2013.
The rest came from its enterprise business, which makes rugged mobile computers, tablets and barcode scanners.
Motorola Solutions' net income fell to $147 million, or 59 cents per share, in the quarter 27 from $307 million, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 62 cents per share
Revenue fell 5.3 percent to $1.44 billion.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 41 cents per share on revenue of $1.39 billion.
Motorola Solutions is not related to smartphone maker Motorola Mobility, which is now owned by China's Lenovo Group Ltd.
Up to Monday's close, the company's stock had fallen about 4 pct this year. (Reporting By Arathy S Nair and Anya George Tharakan in Bangalore; Editing by Ted KerrEditing by Robin Paxton)

LCD Suit to Test Global Reach Of U.S. Antitrust Law; Motorola Mobility¡¦s Suit Involves Alleged Price Fixing of Parts Sold and Assembled Abroad

A federal appeals court this month will take up a case involving mobile-phone screens that could test the reach of U.S. antitrust law in the global economy.
Chicago-based phone maker Motorola Mobility has brought a lawsuit alleging Samsung Electronics Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and other Asian companies colluded for nearly a decade to fix prices on liquid-crystal-display panels. The device maker says the allegedly cozy pricing agreements caused it to pay too much for the flat screens installed in its products.
Some of the companies have pleaded guilty to criminal price-fixing charges, but they dispute many of Motorola¡¦s claims and generally deny their conduct adversely affected the company. Motorola and the LCD makers are clashing over whether damage claims on the foreign-sold panels belong in the U.S. legal system at all.
The civil case, scheduled for arguments on Nov. 13, is being watched by U.S. and foreign governments because it could affect how U.S. antitrust law applies to the manufacturing of high-tech products with many components that are sold and assembled abroad before arriving in the U.S. market.
The case focuses on LCD panels made in Asia and primarily delivered to Asian subsidiaries of Motorola that built phones later shipped to the U.S. and other locations.
The outcome could have broad ramifications because most manufacturing takes place offshore and price-fixing investigations often focus on the component parts of complex products instead of the final products themselves, John Terzaken of law firm Allen & Overy LLP said.
¡§Given that framework, the decision is likely to be really significant,¡¨ said Mr. Terzaken, who isn¡¦t involved in the case.
Motorola says it purchased more than $5 billion worth of LCD panels for its Razr phones and other devices during the alleged industry price fixing, claiming it paid on average about 22% more for the panels on account of the conspiracy. A trial judge threw out nearly all of Motorola¡¦s claims in January, saying the company could sue over the 1% of LCD panels delivered directly to Motorola in the U.S., but not over the 99% of LCD panels bought by Motorola¡¦s foreign affiliates.
The Chicago-based Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals then issued a short-lived decision in March that also went against Motorola, but with broader reasoning that said the phone maker couldn¡¦t proceed with most claims because the alleged price fixing didn¡¦t have a direct effect on U.S. commerce.
That ruling prompted the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to weigh in with concerns. The agencies warned the decision could have the collateral effect of crimping the government¡¦s power to combat overseas price fixing. In recent years, the Justice Department brought many criminal cases over LCD price fixing, as well as dozens of prosecutions against Asian companies and executives for price fixing in the auto-parts industry.
The Justice Department and the FTC don¡¦t embrace all of Motorola¡¦s claims. But they joined the company in persuading the Seventh Circuit to withdraw the ruling. The court now is reconsidering the case, this time giving all sides more time to make their arguments.
The appeals court¡¦s earlier reasoning ¡§threatens the ability of government law-enforcement and private actions to prevent and redress massive harm to U.S. consumers,¡¨ the government said in a legal brief.
Businesses around the globe are fearful of U.S. antitrust lawsuits like Motorola¡¦s because winning plaintiffs can collect three times the amount of damages caused by anticompetitive conduct. Those concerns are prominent in legal submissions from foreign governments, including Japan and South Korea, which object to Motorola¡¦s case and are worried about its effect on their companies.
¡§Giving private U.S. attorneys, which do not bear responsibility in international diplomacy and cooperation, the right to interfere with Japanese governmental regulation of the Japanese market is troublesome,¡¨ Japan¡¦s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said in a court brief.
The case requires the appeals court to sort out of the meaning of the 1982 Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, which says the Sherman Act, the primary U.S. antitrust statute, doesn¡¦t apply to offshore business that doesn¡¦t have a direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on U.S. commerce.
Motorola argues U.S. antitrust law must apply fully to its manufacturing arrangements, which it said were common for American companies. It alleges the LCD makers targeted Motorola and worked hard to have their panels included in U.S.-bound phones. ¡§The cartel is thus obviously subject to U.S. antitrust law, which exists for one reason: to protect U.S. businesses, markets and consumers from anticompetitive conduct,¡¨ it said in a court brief.
Motorola declined to comment beyond court briefs. China¡¦s Lenovo Group Ltd. recently acquired Motorola from Google Inc.
The LCD makers say nearly all of Motorola¡¦s case should be thrown out. ¡§It makes no difference that some of the panels eventually reached the United States as components of phones because the underlying injuries arose in foreign markets,¡¨ the companies said in court papers.
The defendants also say Motorola¡¦s legal claims can be rejected without limiting the Justice Department¡¦s right to prosecute foreign conduct that has direct effects in the U.S.
LG Display and Samsung declined to comment. Sharp didn¡¦t respond to requests for comment.
Motorola¡¦s lawsuit is separate from U.S. criminal proceedings against many top LCD makers that resulted in criminal fines totaling more than $1 billion.
Sharp pleaded guilty in 2008 and was sentenced to pay a $120 million fine for fixing prices on LCD panels sold to Motorola and other companies. That same year LG Display pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $400 million for LCD price fixing. The criminal charges in LG¡¦s case made no mention of Motorola. The Justice Department has said Samsung was a co-conspirator in LCD price fixing, but the company cooperated early on with U.S. investigators and wasn¡¦t charged.

HTC Sees Brighter Fourth-Quarter Sales; Smartphone Maker HTC Faces Competition From China, Apple but Expects to Stay Profitable

TAIPEI¡XHTC Corp. on Friday predicted sales would at least stay flat in the fourth quarter after three years of decline.
The Taiwanese smartphone maker expects revenue of 43 billion New Taiwan dollars to NT$47 billion (US$1.41 billion to US$1.55 billion) for the current quarter ending Dec. 31. The target range represents a growth of 2.7% to 12% from NT$41.86 billion in the third quarter, and as much as 9.6% higher than the NT$42.90 billion it fetched in the same period in 2013.
HTC also expects to remain profitable for the third straight quarter. In the three months ended Sept. 30, HTC reported a net profit of NT$640 million, compared with a net loss of NT$2.97 billion a year earlier.
We are forecasting a pretty material increase in handset shipment volume [for the fourth quarter],¡¨ Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang told investors during a conference call. Mr. Chang declined to disclose the company¡¦s shipment forecast.
¡§I hope the momentum will extend into the first quarter of next year,¡¨ Mr. Chang said.
But analysts say HTC still faces headwinds in a market dominated by Apple Inc. and fast-growing Chinese players.
A challenge HTC and most Android handset makers face in this quarter is the stronger-than-expected demand for the new iPhones. Apple recently launched two iPhones, one with a bigger 5? inch screen. Both offer one of the biggest revamps to the iPhone in two years and are well-timed for the year-end holiday season.
HTC, once the world¡¦s top smartphone maker by volume, dropped out of the top 10 largest handset vendors by shipments last year. Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. have been grabbing HTC¡¦s share in the high-end market, while low-cost Chinese makers have been squeezing the Taiwanese company in the mid- and low-end markets.
HTC is hoping to reverse years of shrinking sales by beefing up its midrange product lines and expanding into non-smartphone businesses.
The company has recently added a selfie-focused smartphone to its midprice Desire line. It has also unveiled the Nexus 9 tablet with Google Inc., a waterproof action camera and software for taking selfie photos.
Mr. Chang said HTC has plans to launch new smartphones over the next two quarters, but declined to give more details.
He also said the project with Google doesn¡¦t mean HTC is returning to contract manufacturing of phones and tablets for other brands.
¡§We are open to, and will also consider, co-branding opportunities with partners,¡¨ he added.
But the midtier market is getting crowded, which complicates HTC¡¦s reliance on that segment as a solution, analysts say.
Samsung said Thursday it would seek to compete head-on against low-priced Chinese rivals amid falling sales in China. Chinese brands like Xiaomi Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. are already dominating the that market.
¡§Apparently HTC is trying to stay away from the competition from Apple in the high-end segment. But the smartphone market, especially the mid- and low-end segments, is still very tough,¡¨ said KGI Securities analyst Richard Ko.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Samsung looks stuck in a dynastic value trap

HONG KONG, Oct 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Samsung Electronics looks stuck in a dynastic value trap. After a miserable year, the South Korean conglomerate's shares are trading at a rock-bottom earnings multiple. Though the pessimism is probably overdone, increased competition in smartphones and the Lee family's succession plans could delay any revival.
By its own admission, Samsung has been slow to respond to rapidly changing competition in the smartphone business. Although phone shipments grew slightly, cheaper Chinese rivals like Lenovo and Xiaomi squeezed Samsung's margins. The group's operating profit in the third quarter was 60 percent lower than in the same period of last year, and it's worst quarterly result in three years.
The Samsung sell-off may already have priced in a lot of bad news. After a 13 percent decline this year, Samsung shares trade at a multiple of less than 8 times its earnings for the last twelve months. That's the lowest of any its peers. Rival Apple , which is also sitting on a large pile of cash, trades on a multiple of more than 16 times. Samsung's valuation implies that the operating profit margin for its IT & Mobile Communications division will fall to 3.1 percent in 2015, according to Bernstein. The unit reported a 7.1 percent margin in the latest quarter.
Mobile accounts for less than half of Samsung's operating profit, with the rest coming from televisions, semiconductors, and display panels. Yet smartphones have been the main driver of the conglomerate's earnings in recent years. Samsung doesn't seem to have a compelling strategy to differentiate itself from its equally ambitious peers. It's too early to say whether the innovative curvy screens and wearable devices will make up for the slowdown.
Meanwhile, inheritance issues may interfere with hopes that Samsung might share some of its $50 billion net cash pile with shareholders. The Samsung Group has been busy restructuring in light of the ill-health of patriarch Lee Kun-hee. A higher payout which would raise Samsung's valuation is not in the interests of Lee's children until they secure a firmer grip on the electronics business, in which the family owns just a 4.7 percent direct stake.
Though Samsung may be trading at rock-bottom multiples it's likely to ring flat for a while.

Has Samsung Lost Its Grip to Chinese Smartphones?; Makers of Low-Price Cellphones Force South Korean Firm to Scale Back Ambitions

SEOUL¡XThe rapid deterioration of Samsung Electronics Co.¡¦s mobile-phone business raises the question: Will Chinese companies soon rule the smartphone market?
The world¡¦s biggest smartphone maker by sales said Thursday that its third-quarter net profit dropped 49% as less-expensive handsets, chiefly from China, ate away at its business. A trio of market-tracking firms confirmed that the South Korean technology company is losing ground even faster than many analysts had predicted.
Although Chinese handset makers have been pushing into smartphones for several years, the pace of their rise¡Xand Samsung¡¦s decline¡Xover the last half-year has been stunning.
Since the beginning of this year, global smartphone shipments have ballooned for Chinese smartphone makers including Xiaomi Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. Handsets from Chinese companies now account for 38% of the global market, more than Samsung and Apple Inc. combined, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Xiaomi jumped to third place in the global market, behind Samsung and Apple, with 5.6% in the third quarter. It had 3.9% in the first quarter.
Samsung¡¦s smartphone market share tumbled to 25% in the third quarter from 31% in the first, Strategy Analytics said. The tech company¡¦s mobile-phone profit margin dropped to 7% from 20%. Samsung blamed that decline in part on increased marketing costs to clear a glut of unsold smartphones that piled up in China and elsewhere.
Apple¡¦s iPhone had 12% of the market in the third quarter, down from 15% in the first.
Samsung isn¡¦t the only South Korean company struggling as low-cost Chinese rivals catch up. The Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade forecast recently that Chinese manufacturers will likely catch up with or surpass their Korean rivals within five years in areas including ships, petrochemicals, steel and textiles. In mid- to low-price smartphones, the government research group predicted that China would outstrip Korea within two years.
To be sure, gaining market share doesn¡¦t guarantee profit growth and can erode earnings for everyone. It isn¡¦t clear how much of a profit closely held Xiaomi or Huawei make on smartphones, if any.
But Samsung says it is determined to fight back. Samsung executives said Thursday that they would seek to compete more directly with rivals in mid- and low-price phones, where Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo sell smartphones for about $300. An equivalent model from Samsung can cost twice as much.
Kim Hyun-joon, a senior vice president in Samsung¡¦s mobile-communications business, said the company would tweak the design and user interface of its lower-end devices to set itself apart from its rivals.
Samsung also will seek to produce devices more economically. ¡§The key is efficiency, to increase the number of components shared across mid- to low-end models, so that we can further leverage economies of scale,¡¨ Mr. Kim said.
Samsung also is expected to shuffle executives, as the company typically does toward year-end, in its mobile division.
¡§Helped in part by management changes, we expect Samsung to work aggressively to retake business lost to Xiaomi and others in China,¡¨ Jefferies analyst Sundeep Bajikar wrote in a note to clients.
Following poor earnings earlier this year, hundreds of senior managers in Samsung¡¦s mobile division took a 25% cut in their first-half bonuses, people familiar with the matter said. Executives and senior managers are bracing for more cost cuts, a person familiar with the situation said recently.
Even with Samsung¡¦s new strategy for dealing with its low-cost rivals, the company suggested the best days for its smartphone business may be behind it. Samsung¡¦s third-quarter profit margin of 7% for its mobile business was the lowest since the beginning of 2009. It followed 10 straight quarters in which the division¡¦s margin exceeded 15%. Mr. Kim said the mobile division¡¦s new goal is simply to maintain a double-digit margin.
Samsung still is going strong in semiconductors, a steady source of profit since before its smartphone successes of the past several years. The chip and components business contributed 57% of the company¡¦s third-quarter profit¡Xa contrast to just six months ago, when the mobile division represented 76% of Samsung¡¦s earnings.
Samsung¡¦s memory-chip business is riding strong demand, and the company is hoping that sales of processors will accelerate with the opening of a high-tech factory that is on schedule to start mass production by year-end.
Investors appear optimistic. Samsung¡¦s shares rose 4.5% Thursday in Seoul, their biggest one-day gain in more than a year. Even so, that left the stock down 14% for the year, sliding sharply since early June.

Samsung, Apple Lose Ground to China Smartphone Makers; Market Share for Industry Leader Samsung and Apple Decline as Chinese Smartphones Gain Popularity

The erosion of Samsung Electronics Co.¡¦s and Apple Inc.¡¦s dominance of the global smartphone market accelerated during the third quarter, as Chinese makers of low-cost phones continued to undercut the industry leaders, according to data from three market-share trackers released Thursday.
Samsung, the world¡¦s largest smartphone maker by shipments, saw its market share fall to 24.7% from 35% during the three months ended Sept. 30, its steepest decline since it became the industry leader in the third quarter of 2011, according to data provider Strategy Analytics. Upstart Chinese phone maker Xiaomi Inc. rose to third place with a 5.6% share, up from 2.1%, as its global handset shipments more than tripled.
Apple remained No. 2, with a 12.3% share, but its market share fell from 13.4% as supply problems held back the shipment of its latest-model iPhones, which went on sale in mid-September.
Market-share data released by IDC and Counterpoint Research Thursday showed similar results.
The latest data came after Samsung posted Thursday a sharply lower third-quarter net profit as intensified competition from Chinese smartphone makers hurt the South Korean technology giant¡¦s mobile business.
Linda Sui of Strategy Analytics estimated that Xiaomi was the fourth-most profitable handset maker in the third quarter, trailing Apple, Samsung and LG Electronics Inc. Xiaomi¡¦s preference for low-cost online distribution channels instead of bricks-and-mortar shops helped its profitability, she said.
Xiaomi, which means ¡§Little Rice¡¨ in Chinese, is known for its marketing savvy. The Beijing-based smartphone maker, founded in 2010, has been growing quickly across Asia by selling low-cost handsets that don¡¦t skimp on features, and has created a cultlike fan base among early adopters of new gadgets.
The company has also used social media in growing its popularity. Chairman Lei Jun, who has often been compared with Apple¡¦s late founder Steve Jobs for his presentation style at product launches, has more than 11 million followers on China¡¦s Twitter-like platform, Sina Weibo.
Looking to expand its business overseas, Xiaomi last year hired Hugo Barra, who was an executive at Google¡¦s Android business. The company has expanded into Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and India.
During the second quarter, Xiaomi overtook Samsung as the top smartphone maker in China, the world¡¦s largest smartphone market by shipments, according to market research firm Canalys.
Xiaomi has been expanding into other markets outside China, including Singapore, Malaysia, India and Indonesia and has been borrowing money to fund the expansion.
But industry observers say that despite Xiaomi¡¦s popularity on its home turf, it will face challenges getting consumers familiar with its brand overseas, where it remains relatively unknown.
Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co., meanwhile, have been expanding aggressively outside China. Lenovo¡¦s smartphone sales have been growing fast in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, while Huawei has been increasing its presence in the Middle East and Africa as well as Latin America. In emerging markets, both Huawei and Lenovo are challenging Samsung¡¦s dominance by selling inexpensive models with competitive technological features.
IDC said Samsung¡¦s third-quarter market share dropped 8.7 percentage points to 23.8% as its shipments fell 8.2% from a year earlier. Apple¡¦s market share fell to 12% from 12.9%, while Xiaomi came in third with a market share of 5.3%, up from 2.1% a year earlier. Lenovo ranked fourth with a market share of 5.2%, up from 4.7%, followed by LG¡¦s 5.1%.
Lenovo¡¦s market share is expected to rise after it completes the acquisition of U.S. handset maker Motorola Mobility later this year.
Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah said Samsung has been losing market share at every price point: in the premium segment to Apple; in the middle tier to Xiaomi, and Huawei; and in the bottom tier to Lenovo and a number of local brands such as Micromax in India and Mito in Indonesia.

 Lenovo  Completes Motorola Acquisition; World¡¦s Largest PC Maker Expands in the Smartphone Market

Lenovo Group Ltd. said Thursday it has completed its $2.91 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility, as the world¡¦s largest personal-computer maker continues its expansion in the global smartphone market.
The deal with Lenovo opens a new chapter for Motorola, which has been unprofitable as a unit of Google Inc. Lenovo, which makes the ThinkPad line of PCs and Yoga line of tablet-PC convertibles, first announced its plans to buy Motorola from Google in January.
Motorola plans to turn around its business by taking advantage of Lenovo¡¦s efficient supply chain and distribution networks as well as economies of scale that could bring down material-procurement costs. Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing has said several times this year that he expects to turn Motorola profitable within four to six quarters after completing the deal.
Lenovo will operate Motorola as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Motorola¡¦s headquarters will stay in Chicago and current President Rick Osterloh will continue to head the business, while Liu Jun, the head of Lenovo¡¦s mobile business, will become Motorola¡¦s chairman, Lenovo said.
Founded in China, Lenovo bought International Business Machines Corp.¡¦s PC business in 2005. The company, now headquartered in both China and the U.S., overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. to become the No. 1 PC maker by shipments last year.
As the global PC market has become saturated over the years, Lenovo is seeking new sources of growth by expanding its smartphone business, trying to take on Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. in the global market. Lenovo, one of the largest smartphone vendors in China, has been increasing its presence in Southeast Asia, Russia and other emerging markets. In the third quarter, Lenovo was the world¡¦s fourth-largest smartphone vendor with a 5.2% share, behind Samsung, Apple and China¡¦s Xiaomi Inc., according to research firm IDC.
While Motorola¡¦s global smartphone market share is much smaller than Lenovo¡¦s, Mr. Yang has said that Lenovo can gain footholds in the U.S. and other mature markets by taking advantage of Motorola¡¦s strong relationship with telecommunication carriers and its intellectual properties that can help fend off patent lawsuits. In the U.S., Lenovo plans to keep selling Motorola-branded smartphones instead of phones with Lenovo logos.
In the U.S., Motorola was the fifth-largest smartphone vendor in the second quarter, with a 4.1% market share, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.

BEIJING, Oct 30 (Reuters) - China's Xiaomi Inc has become the world's third-largest smartphone vendor just three years after first hitting the market, trailing only Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc, according to a new industry study.
Strategy Analytics said Xiaomi accounted for 6 percent of all 320 million smartphones shipped during July-September. Samsung made up 25 percent, down from 35 percent a year earlier due to rising competition from several directions.
Apple's share also fell slightly to 12 percent.
"Xiaomi was the star performer," Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston said in a statement.
"Samsung continues to face tough competition from Apple at the higher-end of the smartphone market, from Xiaomi and Huawei in the middle-tiers, and from Lenovo and others at the entry-level."
Xiaomi has been the top seller in its home market of China and recently entered India, where it sells phones exclusively through e-commerce site Flipkart.
Vice President Hugo Barra told Reuters in Bangalore last month that the company aimed to sell 100,000 phones a week in India in October when the country celebrates Diwali. (Reporting by Gerry Shih)

SEOUL, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Thursday said it would revamp its smartphone line-up to take on competitors in the rapidly growing mid-to-low range segment, after third-quarter earnings set it on course for its worst year since 2011.
The global smartphone leader's market share declined in annual terms for the third straight quarter in July-September, lagging Apple Inc in the premium market and overtaken by rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd and Xiaomi Inc at the bottom end, research firm Strategy Analytics said.
Executives said the South Korean giant would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart, after it announced its worst third-quarter profit in more than three years.
"The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth," Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon said during a conference call with analysts.
Samsung said its third-quarter operating profit fell by an annual 60.1 percent to 4.1 trillion won ($3.9 billion), matching its guidance issued earlier this month.
While the company expects profits to pick up in the fourth quarter on strong demand for televisions and memory chips, analysts still expect Samsung to record its worst annual operating profit in three years.
Profit for the mobile division fell 73.9 percent to 1.75 trillion won in the third quarter, its worst performance since the second quarter of 2011.
Samsung spent most of the quarter without launching a new flagship device, and continued to struggle in the mid-to-low tier markets against cheaper and value-packed offerings like Xiaomi's Redmi 1S.
Robert Yi, Samsung's head of investor relations, said the firm would launch new mid-tier models in the fourth quarter, although he didn't specify what features they would have.
Samsung expects average selling prices for handsets will rise in the fourth quarter due to an increase in premium smartphone sales, namely of the Galaxy Note 4, and as demand picks up in the holiday shopping season.
Analysts say Samsung will likely have to sacrifice margins to protect its market share. Cheaper phones are expected to drive global smartphone market growth in coming years, meaning a general trend of lower average selling prices.
Samsung's chips division was a bright spot, recording a 2.26 trillion operating profit for the July-September quarter to mark the highest earnings since the third quarter of 2010.

Huawei¡¦s Chen: Advanced Tech Can Help Us Enter the U.S. Market; Chinese Hardware Maker Is Looking to 5G, Cloud and Big Data; Security Accusations Have ¡¥No Facts¡¦

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.¡XHuawei Technologies Co., which has been effectively shut out of the U.S. telecommunications-equipment market on security concerns, hopes that investments in advanced technology will help the Chinese company eventually break through.
¡§It will take a longer time than it took in Europe and Asia for entering the U.S. market,¡¨ Huawei Senior Vice President Chen Lifang said at the WSJD Live global technology conference Wednesday. ¡§My confidence comes from advanced technologies¡¨ like fifth generation, or 5G, mobile technology, optical networking, cloud computing and big data, she added.
Since 2012, Huawei, the world¡¦s second-largest telecom-equipment maker after Sweden¡¦s Ericsson, has been the subject of concerns in the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom that the Shenzhen-based company might have ties to the Chinese government. A U.S. congressional report in 2012 recommended that the U.S. government avoid using equipment from the firm, encouraging U.S. companies to seek alternative vendors for their network gear.
Ms. Chen said the claims are ¡§accusations with no facts substantiating the claims.¡¨
¡§We will continue to work on improving security and make investments,¡¨ she said, noting Huawei¡¦s work on smartphone security and data centers.
Huawei competes with the likes of Cisco Systems Inc. and Juniper Networks Inc. in networking equipment. Responding to a question about Cisco¡¦s struggles in China and claims of an unfair playing field for foreign players, Ms. Chen said most of the backbone telecom-network equipment used by the Chinese government, the financial industry and telecom carriers in the country is provided by Cisco and not Huawei
Boosted by strong sales in its home market, Huawei¡¦s earnings have climbed steadily in recent years despite concerns about security.
The company has forecast 2018 revenue of 435.7 billion yuan, or roughly $71 billion, up from 239.03 billion yuan in 2013. Huawei¡¦s revenue in China rose 14% last year as smartphone sales increased. Revenue from the company¡¦s enterprise business, which helps corporate clients build their internal communication networks, increased roughly 30%, Huawei has said.
Ms. Chen said Huawei aims to sell 80 million mobile phones, up 54% from last year. Huawei¡¦s smartphones have little presence in the U.S., but the company has been growing rapidly in other parts of the world, especially in emerging markets.
In the second quarter, Huawei was the third-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Apple Inc., with its market share jumping to 6.9% from 4.3% a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. No. 1 Samsung Electronics Co. saw its market share drop to 25% from 32% a year earlier.
For smartphones, Ms. Chen said that Huawei expects Chinese and European markets to contribute further to its growth. China, the world¡¦s biggest smartphone market, is transitioning to 4G mobile technology, while the European market is a ¡§high value market,¡¨ she said.
While there has been some consolidation in the global handset market with rival Lenovo Group Ltd. acquiring Google Inc.¡¦s Motorola handset unit, Ms. Chen said Huawei isn¡¦t interested in acquisitions to grow in the space.

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Corning Inc, the supplier of Gorilla glass to Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics , reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings, helped by launches of new smartphone models.
Shares of the company, which also supplies LCD panels to consumer electronics companies such as Sony Corp, LG and Lenovo Group, rose 1.6 percent in early trading.
Smartphones such as Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and Samsung's Galaxy Alpha were launched in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Corning said it would launch a new version of Gorilla glass on Nov. 20.
The company, however, said fourth-quarter core sales in its speciality materials business, which makes Gorilla glass, were expected to decline by low- to mid-teen digits percent from the third quarter due to the absence of any major new launches.
"What happens after a new launch is at some point, they take enough glass to continue to build out their products and that's why we think that in the fourth quarter, we'll see sales down," Senior Vice President Tony Tripeny told Reuters.
Its LCD panel volumes in the current quarter are expected to be flat or fall slightly from the previous quarter as most of the holiday season orders had been shipped in the third quarter, Tripeny said.
Corning had been hurt by falling LCD glass prices in the past few quarters, but the company said the pace of the price decline was moderating.
The company's core net sales rose to $2.65 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.1 billion, a year earlier.
Net income rose to $1.01 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $408 million, or 28 cents per share.
The company reported core earnings of 40 cents per share.
Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of 37 cents per share and revenue of $2.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Corning shares were up 1 percent at $19.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by Kirti Pandey)

Samsung¡¦s Primacy Is Tested in China; South Korean Giant to Roll Out Cheaper Line of Smartphones to Fend Off Competition From Xiaomi, Others

SHANGHAI¡XSamsung Electronics Co.¡¦s attempt to stay on top of the fast-changing smartphone business will depend on winning back people like He Wenzong.
The 30-year-old apparel-company employee and Shanghai resident last year traded his Galaxy S3 phone, one of Samsung¡¦s most successful products, for a handset made by Beijing-based upstart Xiaomi Inc., which a few months ago displaced Samsung as China¡¦s No. 1 smartphone seller.
Xiaomi¡¦s phone offers better software and services, Mr. He says, at a fraction of a new Samsung¡¦s price. ¡§To me, it looks like it¡¦s the same quality, but one costs 2,000 yuan ($327) and the other is 3,500 yuan,¡¨ says Mr. He. ¡§So why would I pick Samsung?¡¨
Across China¡Xand around the globe¡Xother people are starting to feel the same way. Samsung has lost its top position for mobile-phone sales in India, and research firms that track smartphone shipments say it is in danger of being toppled in Thailand and the Philippines. Though Samsung is still the No. 1 smartphone maker globally, it has been losing market share in recent quarters.
In China, where Samsung gets 18% of its total sales, more than half of which is from the mobile-phone division, the company is parachuting in executives and outside consultants to assess the problem and figure out how to fix it, according to people with knowledge of the moves. The company is lowering prices for its existing handsets by up to 20%, considering a new marketing strategy in the country, and preparing to roll out a new, cheaper line of smartphones for emerging markets, the people said.
The steps are part of a larger attempt to shore up the mobile-phone division, which accounts for around 60% of Samsung¡¦s operating profit.
On Thursday, the company is expected to report that operating profit for the quarter ended in September has fallen by about 60% from a year earlier, following a 20% decline in the quarter before, largely because of what the company acknowledged was ¡§increased competition¡¨ in China.
Analysts expect the operating-profit margin of the mobile-phone division to fall to 8.1% in the third quarter, down from 19.8% in the first quarter, the thinnest margin since early 2010.
After leading sales in the Chinese smartphone market every quarter for the past two-and-a-half years, Samsung dropped behind Xiaomi during the quarter ended June, tying for second place with Lenovo Group Ltd. and Coolpad Group Ltd., according to data tracker Canalys.
Samsung¡¦s stock price has plunged 26% since early June, and last week fell to a nearly three-year low.
Samsung has cut the bonuses of hundreds of managers in its mobile division, according to people familiar with the matter. In an attempt to streamline operations, Samsung is combining many of its main business divisions in the U.S. under one chief, say people with direct knowledge of the move. That could foreshadow a similar consolidation of leadership at headquarters, where the company is run by three co-chief executives, said one of these people.
In an attempt to bring down its manufacturing costs, Samsung opened a $2 billion mobile-phone factory in Vietnam last year, and in July won approval from Vietnamese authorities for another factory to produce smartphone and tablet displays.
A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment on its China strategy or personnel moves.
Samsung became the biggest seller of smartphones globally by offering a full range of handsets¡Xfrom cheap models to high-end rivals to Apple Inc.¡¦s iPhone. Samsung manufactured its own displays, memory chips and batteries, and backed its devices with billions of dollars in marketing.
For years, that strategy worked in China too, where Samsung was an early player¡Xentering in 1992, the same year that South Korea established diplomatic relations there.
Samsung began building up extensive distribution networks to sell its televisions and mobile phones in the 1990s, giving it a sizable head start versus Apple when it began roll out high-end smartphones. Since most Chinese consumers buy their phones at mobile-phone or consumer-electronics retail outlets rather than through carriers, Samsung¡¦s network of stores let it reach consumers from small villages to big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
Recently, however, more Chinese consumers are buying phones online, and many of Samsung¡¦s Chinese rivals, like Xiaomi, sell primarily that way, which also lowers their overhead. Xiaomi sells its handsets at close to cost, aiming to make money on software and services sold over the phones instead¡Xa tactic that lets it undercut Samsung prices.
Samsung¡¦s Chinese rivals run Google Inc.¡¦s Android operating system¡Xlike the vast majority of Samsung¡¦s smartphones. But they have been more efficient at pre-loading sales-generating apps on their phones and promoting their own app stores.
Samsung, by its own admission, has been slow to respond. The company kept its prices high, even on lower-tier smartphones, leading to a glut of unsold devices.
Samsung is focusing executive firepower on the problem, sending its top marketing and financial officers to scope out conditions on the ground, and forming an internal China strategy team as well as hiring consultants from McKinsey & Co. Inc. and Boston Consulting Group, according to a person with direct knowledge of the moves.
To unload excess inventory, Samsung has lowered some smartphone prices in China by between 10% and 20%, a tactic that could help it recapture some market share in the second half of the year, Canalys says.
The company is also preparing to release¡Xinitially in China¡Xa new line of smartphones dubbed Galaxy A, a midrange phone that offers many of the features of a high-end Galaxy S device but is priced more competitively with Chinese phones, according to people familiar with the plans.
Such price cuts could steepen the decline in operating-profit margin for mobile phones. Samsung worries it could also damage a premium-brand image it has spent years building, says Chang Sea-jin, a professor of management at South Korea¡¦s KAIST College of Business.
¡§Last year, Samsung knew that Chinese brands were coming,¡¨ Mr. Chang says, but didn¡¦t slash prices since it was ¡§trying to maintain its premium segment brand.¡¨

Apple¡¦s Surprising Growth Driver: the Mac; After Almost 30 Years, the Brand Is Giving Tech Giant Solid Footing With Strong Sales

During a quarter marked by frenzied demand for the latest iPhones, Apple Inc. logged its biggest sales gains with a product heading into middle-age: the Mac.
On the 30th anniversary of the first Macintosh, a 21% jump in unit sales helped Apple¡¦s computer line leapfrog the sagging iPad to become the company¡¦s second biggest-selling product line in revenue terms, just behind the iPhone.
The Mac line generated revenue of $6.625 billion in the quarter, more than iPad revenue of $5.316 billion.
Demand for Macs rose amid falling sales of Windows PCs, giving Apple more than 6% of the global PC market, according to the research firm IDC. That percentage is Apple¡¦s highest market share since 1995, when Microsoft Corp. established its dominance over the computer market with Windows 95. The Mac gained market share in 33 of the last 34 quarters, lifting its share from 2.1% in 2006, according to IDC.
Several factors have contributed to the Mac¡¦s steady rise in the last eight years: a halo effect conferred by popular Apple devices like the iPhone and iPad; a decision to stop charging for updates of Mac operating software; high visibility through the company¡¦s own retail stores; and Apple¡¦s introduction of innovative designs like the MacBook Air at lower prices than the company usually charges.
Apple also has benefited recently from its relatively greater popularity in developed markets like the U.S. and Western Europe, where consumer demand for PCs has been relatively steady.
Macs, of course, cost considerably more than tablets, so in unit terms tablets still outsell Macs. For the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, Apple sold 39.27 million iPhones, 12.32 million iPads, and 5.52 million Macs.
Macs remain niche products. Apple laptops, even after price cuts to two models this year, on average sell for nearly three times the price of a Windows-based notebook, according to retail-store data from market-research firm NPD Group.
Some customers find Apple¡¦s products worth the extra expense. Ali Mirza, a 21-year-old law student at the University of Edinburgh, said he bought a Lenovo Y500 laptop last year after years of owning a Mac. He thought the Lenovo would provide better value because it had higher specifications at a cheaper price. But as problems with his computer piled up, Mr. Mirza decided to go back to a Mac. He purchased a 13-inch MacBook Pro last week.
¡§A computer is more than the sum of its parts,¡¨ said Mr. Mirza. ¡§I could get a cheaper computer, but I probably wouldn¡¦t get the same value out of it as I would out of a Mac.¡¨
Apple¡¦s popularity in other sorts of devices has given the Mac a boost. The iPhone, in particular, has breathed new life into the Mac by serving as a gateway for customers who wouldn¡¦t otherwise have considered buying an Apple computer.
¡§If somebody has a great experience with an Apple product the first time, they are much more likely to buy another Apple product,¡¨ said Phil Schiller, Apple¡¦s senior vice president of marketing, noting that ¡§a very large number¡¨ of first-time Mac owners purchased the computer after buying an iPhone.
Apple is trying to lure more iPhone users to the Mac by linking smartphone features to the computer. The company recently added so-called continuity features that help Apple devices to work better together. For example, a user can start writing an email on an iPhone and continue writing it on a Mac, switching freely between the two devices.
IPhones generated $23.7 billion in revenue for the quarter.
Apple started to gain market share in 2006 with its launch of MacBook laptops, which had a starting price that was more affordable than its earlier laptops.
Apple also had a hit with its MacBook Air laptop, which went on sale in 2008 and introduced a new category of computers with slim profiles and improved battery life that Windows PC makers have sought to copy.
Price cuts have reduced the MacBook Air¡¦s starting price to $899, more within reach of Windows buyers. Computers in the MacBook Air¡¦s category are the only part of the PC market expected to grow this year and in 2015, according to research firm Gartner Inc.
The company also benefits from heavy traffic in Apple stores where prospective customers can try new Macs.
Last year, Apple stopped charging for updates of its Mac OS X operating system, a change that may prod shoppers wondering whether to buy immediately or wait for fresh features in the next version.
For the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, Apple sold 39.27 million iPhones, 12.32 million iPads, and 5.52 million Macs.
Gaining further market share won¡¦t be easy for Macs, particularly now that Microsoft and its PC allies have begun to regain their footing after a historically awful 2013, when total PC sales (including Macs) fell 10%. World-wide sales were down only 1.7% in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with a year earlier, IDC said.
Moreover, the biggest Windows PC vendors are making sales that, in prior years, might have gone to tablets, including iPads. In the past year, the PC market has gotten a helping hand from new types of Windows computing devices such as so-called convertibles that work as both laptop and tablet.
Convertibles may be tempting people who wouldn¡¦t have bought a PC at all. In surveys of thousands of people who bought higher-end convertible PCs, 48% said they chose the new device over a tablet, according to the research backed by Intel Corp., which makes the computer chips used in nearly all PCs as well as Macs.
In the PC market, ¡§It¡¦s not as boring as it was a couple of years ago,¡¨ said NPD Group analyst Stephen Baker. ¡§There¡¦s a little more choice.¡¨
Apple¡¦s competitors also have opened new fronts in pricing. Microsoft last spring started charging PC makers a cut-rate price for a type of Windows software, making it possible for manufacturers to offer PCs for less than $200.
Such rock-bottom prices helped expand the pool of PC buyers who might otherwise have purchased either a tablet, a Chromebook (a stripped-down laptop powered by operating software from Google Inc.), or no computing device at all, according to analysts and industry executives.

H-P Seeks Local Buyer for Networking Business in China; Tech Firm Plans to Sell Majority Stake in Unit Amid U.S.-China Tension

Hewlett-Packard Co.¡¦s effort to sell a majority stake in its networking business in China to a local buyer is the latest example of tension between the U.S. and China affecting the ability of technology firms from both countries to do business in each others¡¦ markets.
H-P has begun sounding out private-equity firms in China on their interest in buying H3C Technologies Co., the U.S. company¡¦s corporate-networking unit in the country, people familiar with the matter said Friday. The process is in the early stages and H-P may sell only 51% of H3C, assuming a deal is reached at all, the people said. In a full sale, the business could be worth roughly $5 billion, one of them said.
Over the past few years, tension has risen between the U.S. and China because of mutual suspicion of potential hacking into each other¡¦s telecommunications and Internet networks through equipment supplied by their respective technology companies. U.S. lawmakers compiled a report in 2012 alleging that telecom equipment from Huawei Technologies Co. could be used by Beijing to spy on Americans. The report recommended that U.S. telecom carriers avoid Huawei¡¦s gear. Huawei has rebutted security concerns regarding its equipment.
In China, U.S. providers of technology infrastructure, including H-P and International Business Machines Corp., have faced challenges in part because government agencies and sensitive industries like financial services increasingly turned to domestic vendors like Huawei, according to component suppliers working with both Huawei and its U.S. competitors.
Traditional providers of corporate-networking gear also have been buffeted by low-cost alternatives competitors are offering via the Internet. Earlier this month, IBM completed a deal to sell its x86 server business to Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. for $2.1 billion.
¡§In China, all the foreign companies have had trouble in the last several years¡¨ in the market for computer servers, said Adalio Sanchez, who headed IBM¡¦s x86 server business and will continue to lead the business under Lenovo, in a recent interview. ¡§But now, under the Lenovo umbrella, we think we have the flexibility to become Chinese, to be more palatable to the China government and China customer base,¡¨ he said.
People familiar with the matter said that in order for a deal for H3C to win Chinese government approval, the buyer likely needs to be locally based.
In an interview in September, Eric Xu, Huawei¡¦s acting chief executive, said the company wants China to be an open market. ¡§If China becomes a closed market, that would be a tragedy for Chinese companies,¡¨ because lack of competition makes them less motivated to keep improving their products, he said.
Mr. Xu declined to comment at that time on whether government policies are giving Huawei advantages against U.S. rivals in China.
H3C is a major supplier of corporate data-networking gear in China. The unit, which H-P inherited when it bought 3Com Corp. for $2.7 billion in 2010, has 5,000 employees world-wide, according to its website.
H-P doesn¡¦t break out results for the unit, which sells products such as routers, software and switches, but the company¡¦s networking business overall generated $2.53 billion in sales last year, up from $2.48 billion in 2012, according to its annual report.
The Palo Alto, Calif., company may retain a sizable minority stake in H3C in any deal, the people said. H-P also wants to continue using H3C¡¦s low-cost manufacturing, one of the people said.
H3C was formed in November 2003 as a joint venture between Huawei and 3Com. It grew quickly into a force in the mainland telecommunications market before 3Com bought out Huawei in 2006. That paved the way for H-P to acquire the business when it took over 3Com.
Another Chinese technology company could buy H3C, though it is more likely to be sold to a private-equity group, according to the people familiar with the matter.
It¡¦s not clear whether Huawei is a possible buyer, but the company has said it won¡¦t engage in any big deals in coming years and instead will focus on its own operations on research and development.
H-P is in the midst of a dramatic reordering. The Silicon Valley pioneer this month announced a plan to split into two pieces¡Xone focused on corporate buyers of hardware and services and the other on selling personal computers and printers, each with more than $50 billion in annual revenue. H-P has indicated that it could augment the corporate business through acquisitions, and a sale of H3C could give it cash to bolster that effort.
Before it announced the split, H-P for months was engaged in talks to combine with data-storage giant EMC Corp., in a deal that would create a technology-industry giant valued at more than $120 billion at current market values. Those talks ended, people familiar with the matter have said.

Foxconn in Talks for China Display Plant; Foxconn and Government of Zhengzhou Discussing Investment That Could Reach Up to $5.7 Billion

HONG KONG¡XFoxconn, the company that assembles the bulk of the world¡¦s iPhones, is in preliminary talks to build a factory in northern China that would make high-end screens for the phones as well, in a sign of the company¡¦s ambition to move up the electronics food chain.
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is discussing a possible investment with the government of Zhengzhou, about 750 kilometers south of Beijing, according to people familiar with the talks. The two sides are discussing terms such as how to divide the investment, which could reach as much as 35 billion yuan ($5.7 billion), the people said.
The two sides haven¡¦t yet formulated a concrete investment proposal, they said. If an agreement is reached, it could be Foxconn¡¦s biggest direct investment to date in high-end parts manufacturing.
It remains unclear whether Apple Inc.¡Xwhich relies on Foxconn to make the majority of its iPhones¡Xor other investors are being approached to invest in the display plant. Currently, Apple uses screens made by suppliers in South Korea and Japan.
The development highlights Foxconn¡¦s ambition to supply more expensive components to key customers like Apple. While Foxconn, with revenue of $130 billion last year, has been manufacturing some iPhone components already, like metal casings and cables, mobile displays are much more difficult to make and have higher margins.
That is important to Foxconn, whose sales grew only 1% last year on an annual basis, compared with 53% five years ago, while operating profit margin growth slowed to 2.8% in 2013 from 4.4% in 2009.
Foxconn also is looking for more sources of revenue since Apple, whose business comprises nearly half of its sales, is starting to outsource production of some of its iPhones and iPads to rivals including Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp.
With $19 billion in cash as of the end of June, Foxconn has the hefty amount of capital needed for an investment in advanced manufacturing facilities.
For Apple, buying displays from Foxconn would help the company diversify its screen suppliers beyond Japan¡¦s Sharp Corp. and Japan Display Inc. and South Korea¡¦s LG Display Co.
¡§Foxconn hopes to capture the growing demand for high-resolution, energy-efficient displays and supply Apple and other smartphone makers in the next few years,¡¨ said a person familiar with the situation.
Apple declined to comment.
To be sure, Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou is known for making ambitious statements and floating investment ideas that sometimes don¡¦t materialize.
In 2012, Mr. Gou acquired a 50% stake in a Sharp Corp. display factory in Sakai, Japan, and at the same time Foxconn agreed to take a 10% stake in the Japanese company for ?66.9 billion, or $819 million at that time. Foxconn pulled out of the deal after Sharp¡¦s share price fell sharply. In January, speaking at the company¡¦s 40th anniversary gathering, Mr. Gou said Foxconn is studying the feasibility of building an advanced-panel manufacturing plant in the U.S., though no details have emerged since.
Foxconn also has floated the idea of building a manufacturing plant for components and handsets in Indonesia, and Mr. Gou said he would consider investing at least $1 billion during a February visit to Jakarta. Last month, Foxconn said it is still reviewing the potential investment, while Indonesia¡¦s Finance Minister Chatib Basri told The Wall Street Journal that the plan is stalled over unrealistic demands from Foxconn, including free land and import protections.
¡§The chairman always has lots of new business and investment ideas and he is also approached by many government officials,¡¨ said a Foxconn official, who declined to be named. ¡§Only a few of them materialize as the chairman wants favorable terms that most governments can¡¦t accommodate.¡¨
Foxconn has had more success in China, where it has more than 10 manufacturing sites that employ more than one million workers.
The company already has a factory in Zhengzhou that mainly assembles the latest iPhones and makes components such as metal casings. Thanks to strong demand for bigger-screen iPhones, Foxconn has been heavily recruiting workers in Zhengzhou, where it has been producing about a half million iPhones a day, people familiar with the matter said.
According to the people, Mr. Gou visited Zhengzhou in August, where he met government officials to discuss the investment proposal. Foxconn General Manager Wu Yi-Wei, who leads the display operation, also went to Zhengzhou with a team to survey the site last month, the person said.
Mr. Gou has said he wants Foxconn to be a major player in the display industry.
Besides the stake in the Sharp factory, Foxconn owns an 11% stake in Taiwan-based Innolux Corp., and an undisclosed stake in a $1.5 billion joint venture with the Shenzhen city government called Century Technology (Shenzhen) Co. Innolux and Century Technology make displays for phones, laptops and monitors and supply to Hewlett-Packard Co., Dell Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd. People familiar with the matter say the proposed new plant would use more advanced panel-manufacturing technology, capable of making screens with thinner frames that consume less power.
¡§It makes sense for Foxconn to build the display plant near its major iPhone production site in Zhengzhou. The supply chain is already established there and it would save the transportation cost of displays,¡¨ said CIMB analyst Wanli Wang.
But Alberto Moel, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said Innolux hasn¡¦t been a competitive player in the display industry, and Foxconn¡¦s potential investment would be a big gamble given hefty capital expenditures required to build an advanced liquid-crystal-display facility.

Huawei says third-quarter smartphone shipments jump 26 percent, strong demand for high-end devices

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd said third-quarter smartphone shipments jumped 26 percent year-on-year, doubling devices shipped to the high-margin premium market dominated by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc.
Shenzhen-based Huawei, the world's third-biggest smartphone supplier after the dominant pair, shipped 16.8 million smartphones globally in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to company data. About a quarter of those were mid- to high-end models, more than twice as many as the same period last year.
"We are breaking our bottlenecks of mid- to high-end models step by step, especially in overseas markets," Huawei consumer business group marketing executive Shao Yang told Reuters in an interview.
Huawei, like Chinese rivals Lenovo Group Ltd and ZTE Corp, is better known for selling low- and mid-priced handsets in emerging markets than high-end models in developed countries.
Industry watchers say that although Huawei's premium devices are cutting-edge, the company has struggled to break into the high-end sector markets like the United States due to a lack of brand recognition and security concerns. Huawei had 6.7 percent of the global smartphone market in the second quarter, a distant third behind Samsung Electronics and Apple, according to analysis firm IDC.
As if to prove a point, Huawei unveiled a smartphone with an advanced sapphire glass display just days before Apple released its highly anticipated iPhone 6 in September.
"We have never questioned our ability to make products, but sometimes we are worried if we could occupy a place emotionally in consumers' hearts. So we will try to achieve that next year," Shao said.
Huawei's global marketing budget would leap at least 30 percent in 2015, compared with $440 million this year, he said.
The company has shipped 51 million smartphones globally in the first three quarters of 2014 - about 63.8 percent of its annual shipment target of 80 million, according to Reuters' calculations, based on figures provided by Huawei.
Shao said he expected quarter-on-quarter shipments growth of up to 80 percent in the fourth quarter, a peak holiday season for smartphone vendors.
A little more than half of Huawei's smartphone shipments went to China in the third quarter. Elsewhere, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific recorded the strongest growth.

ANALYSIS-IBM struggles to reinvent itself in an age of cloud

WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - When IBM Corp CEO Ginni Rometty was asked recently for her tips on how to transform companies, she spoke of "relentless reinvention" and not protecting the past.
Applying those precepts to IBM is proving particularly tricky as many of the company's old-line businesses have already been shut down or sold, while the units that are supposed to push future growth, such as cloud and security, face stiff competition.
Earlier on Monday, IBM reported a marked slowdown in business in September and abandoned its 2015 operating earnings target. The company also announced it will hive off its loss-making semiconductor unit to contract chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc.
Analysts and investors agree that relentless reinvention is something to strive for at Big Blue, but some of the moves tried by other old line technology companies - such as a split or a spinoff of weaker businesses - might not be tenable for IBM, which successfully reinvented itself into a services provider in the early 2000s.
"I don't expect to see anything of that magnitude coming from IBM in part because they have systematically divested some of the businesses that were a drag on earnings in the last decade," said Charles King, principal analyst at research firm Pund-It in California.
Rometty, who took over as CEO nearly three years ago, has accelerated divestitures with the sale of IBM's low-end server business to Lenovo Group Inc and its chip-making business to Globalfoundries Inc. Those moves eliminated two areas that were a drag on profits, but other problems remain.
Its storage and server hardware and enterprise software sectors are slumping and the company faces growing competition in cloud computing from companies such as Amazon.com Inc .
"They're on the wrong side of the IT spending food chain. All the growth is in the cloud," said Dan Ives, analyst at FBR, adding that mature companies have struggled the most with the shift to cloud.
International Business Machines Corp's faster-growing cloud computing, mobile, business analytics, social and security services contribute 25 percent of its revenue
"It is not that they are making a lot of bad choices," said Scott Kessler at S&P Capital IQ.
"It is just that they are so big and so far along one path, that even if they make some good decisions in terms of investments and acquisitions, it seems like it is too little too late in many contexts."
Future spin-offs will likely be centered on its storage unit, analysts said.
The company is also facing criticism that it pursued buybacks at the expense of investment in new technology. IBM spent $13.5 billion to repurchase stock in the first nine months of the year, more than double its net income.
"The company has been using its cash to repurchase stocks and support its earnings per share, but that has severely weakened its balance sheet, which used to be one of the true strengths of the company," said Kessler.
The disappointing third-quarter results also raise questions about investors' patience with Rometty. The CEO, who joined IBM in 1981, recently dispensed advice such as "never define yourself as a product" and "never protect the past" in a Fortune Magazine video interview.
Making such ideals into reality is proving tricky at IBM.
"When you miss expectations and come in with results the market is unhappy with, then that puts much more pressure on her, but she bought herself more time by selling off the micro-electronics business," said Rob Enderle, chief analyst at Enderle Group in California.
"The market today is different than the market that existed a decade ago. She is struggling to readjust to an ever more mobile and cloud business, which caught most of the industry by surprise," he said.   (Reporting by Marina Lopes. Editing by Andre Grenon)

BlackBerry shares up after unconfirmed report on possible  Lenovo  bid

TORONTO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - BlackBerry shares rose more than 3 percent on Monday after a news website said Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group might offer to buy the Canadian technology company.
Benzinga.com, citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter, said an offer worth $15 a share could come as early as this week.
Lenovo and BlackBerry said their companies did not comment on rumors and speculation.
Rumors of a Lenovo bid for BlackBerry have swirled many times over the last two years. Senior Lenovo executives at different times have indicated an interest in BlackBerry as a means to strengthen their own handset business.
The speculation reached a crescendo in the fall of 2013, when BlackBerry was exploring strategic alternatives.
Sources familiar with the situation however, told Reuters last year that the Canadian government had strongly hinted to BlackBerry that any sale to Lenovo would not win the necessary regulatory approvals due to security concerns.
BlackBerry's secure networks manage the email traffic of thousands of large corporate customers, along with government and military agencies across the globe. Under Canadian law, any foreign takeover of BlackBerry would require government approval under the Industry Canada Act.
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told Reuters in February 2012 that he wanted BlackBerry to grow "as a Canadian company." And in December 2011, then-Industry Minister Christian Paradis referred to the company as a "Canadian jewel."
Analysts also have said any sale to Lenovo would face regulatory obstacles, but they have suggested that a sale of just BlackBerry's handset business and not its core network infrastructure might just pass muster with regulators.
BlackBerry's long-struggling handset business turned a profit before special items in the last quarter, after the Waterloo, Ontario-based company concluded its three-year restructuring program.
However, BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen has said he sees the handset business as core to the company for now, as it will foster sales growth over the next few quarters until the software and services business begins to generate new revenue streams in the first half of 2015.
Shares of BlackBerry were up 3.4 percent at $9.81 in early Nasdaq trading. Its Toronto-listed shares were up 3.1 percent at C$11.03. (Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson and Lisa Von Ahn)

IBM Woes Point to a Fresh Overhaul; CEO Disappointed With Results; Revenue Declines for 10th Straight Quarter

International Business Machines Corp., two decades after successfully shifting its focus to software and computer services from hardware, is showing signs of needing another overhaul.
On Monday, the computing and software giant abandoned a longtime earnings target, reported sharply lower third-quarter profit on a surprising 4% downturn in sales, and said it would divest semiconductor operations that underpin much of its remaining computer business.
The downbeat earnings and revenue picture sent IBM shares 7% lower and added to jitters about demand for high-tech products and services following weak results at heavyweights Oracle Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Cisco Systems Inc.
¡§Our results this quarter were disappointing,¡¨ IBM Chief Executive Virginia Rometty said after disclosing the weakness in services and software and a large write-down to divest the semiconductor unit. ¡§We¡¦ve got to reinvent ourself like we¡¦ve done in prior generations.¡¨
It was IBM¡¦s 10th consecutive quarter of flat or declining sales. The results stood in contrast to Apple Inc., which on Monday posted a 13% profit increase on strong September sales of its larger-screen iPhones.
The Armonk, N.Y., technology giant said it no longer expects to earn at least $20 a share next year, a forecast it has maintained for five years and under two chief executives. IBM didn¡¦t offer an estimate for next year, saying it would offer a new outlook in January.
Its shares fell to a three-year intraday low before recovering a bit to finish down $12.95 at $169.19.
Ms. Rometty and other executives insist the focus on services remains the right one, saying IBM must make its software and services offerings more competitive.
¡§We continue to evolve services, the same way we continue to evolve what our clients want in software,¡¨ said Martin Schroeter, IBM¡¦s chief financial officer, in an interview.
Analysts and customers say IBM¡¦s cloud push and efforts to use its depth and breadth to sell big projects that can help change a customer¡¦s business is running out of runway.
The massive overhauls are giving way to lower-cost services built in the ¡§cloud,¡¨ using data centers assembled for that approach by Amazon.com Inc., Google Inc. and others.
Behrooz Najafi, vice president of information technology at Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc., said he hasn¡¦t used any IBM technology in quite a while. He said IBM is an ¡§old technology company¡¨ that is going through a rapid move away from its fading hardware and manufacturing businesses and into cloud computing and software.
IBM has raised its cloud-services profile by acquiring SoftLayer for $2 billion in 2013 and announcing plans to spend $1.2 billion on additional cloud data centers.
Analysts say the effort has been late and impinged on IBM¡¦s efforts to sell its pricier infrastructure services.
In addition to cloud computing, the company has sought to make up for slow growth in services by investing in two promising areas.
One is deriving insights from data generated by customer operations, so-called big-data analytics. The company has invested $16 billion in analytics acquisitions since 2005, and in September it rolled out Watson Analytics, a suite of data-analysis services aimed at small to medium-size businesses.
Another area where IBM is trying to create momentum is artificial intelligence.
Its Watson artificial-intelligence platform made a big splash by winning the television game show Jeopardy in 2011, yet efforts to commercialize that technology have been slow to bear fruit.
IBM has sought to improve profitability by exiting low-margin businesses, such as the recent sale of its commodity server business to Lenovo Group Ltd.
Transferring its semiconductor unit to Globalfoundries Inc. also would reduce the expenses associated with staying abreast of new chip production and design technologies.
IBM agreed to pay the semiconductor company $1.5 billion to take over its chip manufacturing and employees. Under the agreement, Globalfoundries will continue to produce the processors used in IBM systems. IBM also took a $4.7 billion charge to earnings for the divestiture.
IBM¡¦s hopes for a turnaround was based on the assumption that customers would pay it to run their computing operations and help exploit business software. It was a strategy that has served IBM well for nearly two decades.
The move to services, starting in 1993, ¡§was a great move at the time, it saved IBM,¡¨ says Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan¡¦s Ross School of Business. But he makes a play on the title of a book, ¡§Who Says Elephants Can¡¦t Dance?¡¨ by former IBM CEO Louis Gerstner Jr., about its 1990s-era transformation. ¡§It¡¦s time for the elephant to learn a new dance,¡¨ Mr. Gordon says.
Ms. Rometty, who became CEO in January 2012, has tried to modernize the company¡¦s services offerings to emphasize faster-growing parts of the market.
She also dispensed with an unprofitable part of the business, running call centers on behalf of companies.
¡§IBM has great assets in terms of experience in complex enterprises, but the question is: How quickly can they move within the next year to get well positioned? Amazon has everybody on their heels,¡¨ said Vince Kellen, chief information technology officer at the University of Kentucky.
The challenges are apparent in its latest results: IBM posted a 2.9% decline in revenue from services.
While cloud-based revenues grew, the company cited a slowdown in signing contracts to manage large installations of business software, a market with fierce price competition.
Total revenue from IBM¡¦s computers and semiconductor operations fell 15% in the third quarter.
Revenues from mainframes were off 35%, while other computer equipment fell 12%, both over a year earlier.
In all, IBM reported net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 of $18 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with profit in the year-earlier quarter of $4.04 billion, or $3.68 a share.
Revenue fell to $22.4 billion from $23.3 billion a year earlier.
IBM said profit excluding items such as acquisition-related charges and retirement-related costs came to $3.68 a share. Analysts had expected earnings on that basis of $4.31 on revenue of $23.37 billion.

KYOTO, Japan¡XChina¡¦s smartphone boom is being fueled by an unlikely source: Japanese parts makers.
Upstart Chinese phone makers like Xiaomi Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. are increasingly undercutting smartphone giants like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. with high-performance, low-cost handsets.
A significant portion of those handsets¡¦ guts¡Xas much as 50% by value, in some cases¡Xis made by Japanese companies like Murata Manufacturing Co. or TDK Corp. Those parts range from displays and Wi-Fi modules to tiny, energy-storing ceramic capacitors.
¡§Almost all cellphone manufacturers are our customers,¡¨ said Tsuneo Murata, president of Murata, which makes capacitors and other components. ¡§The pie for the component demand is growing.¡¨
The parts sales are a rare bright spot in Japan¡¦s gloomy electronics industry, and China¡¦s smartphone market¡Xthe world¡¦s largest and growing at 19% a year, according to Counterpoint Research¡Xis a big factor. Sales there are being fueled by cutthroat competition among dozens of brands, some of which offer smartphones at less than $100. Lower prices mean smaller budgets for parts, but Japanese suppliers often provide a larger share of components to Chinese brands than to Apple or Samsung, analysts say.
In the second quarter of this year, Xiaomi leapfrogged Apple and Samsung to become the best-selling smartphone provider in China, according to Canalys, a research firm. Counterpoint says Chinese brands will capture about three-quarters of the domestic market this year, in terms of volume, up from one-third in 2010.
Chinese companies are boosting purchases of Japanese parts as they push beyond the domestic market, in order to upgrade their phones. In some Chinese-branded phones, Japanese suppliers provide up to half of the parts by value, said Daiki Takayama, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Another Chinese smartphone maker, ZTE Corp., buys displays from Sharp Corp. of Japan for its high-end phones, along with camera modules from Sony Corp., said Lu Qianhao, head of the company¡¦s handset marketing strategy. He cited technological know-how, manufacturing expertise and quality control as advantages of Japanese suppliers.
By contrast, Japanese suppliers account for about one-third of the bill of materials for the latest iPhones, and less than that for Samsung phones, said Shoji Sato, an analyst at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.
Even phone-screen maker Japan Display Inc., whose shares plunged last week after it predicted a loss this fiscal year because of delays in shipments to Apple, says that it expects sales to Chinese smartphone makers to nearly triple to ?180 billion ($1.68 billion) during the same period.
Japan Display makes liquid-crystal displays for smartphones and tablet computers, one of the most competitive areas in the parts business, in which rivals like LG Display Co. of South Korea have been making inroads. Suppliers like Murata that dominate hard-to-copy niches are doing better.
Murata, which is based in Kyoto, built on a long tradition of ceramics-making in Japan¡¦s former capital to hone its specialization in capacitors and related components.
The company¡¦s latest capacitors are not much bigger than a grain of sand, but they contain about 100 layers of ceramics, and Murata uses proprietary machines and methods to make them.
¡§It¡¦s like making a good mille-feuille,¡¦¡¦ Mr. Takayama said. ¡§You can buy a very high-quality egg, the best vanilla essence or whatever, but nobody else knows how to mix it or how long to bake it.¡¨
Because Murata is the world¡¦s largest supplier of capacitors for phones, with a 35% share, it can assure manufacturers of a reliable supply, analysts say. That is important given the tight schedules of the smartphone business.
Capacitors cost pennies or less, but state-of-the-art handsets contain 700 to 800 of them¡Xthree or four times as many as in previous generations of smartphones, the company says.
Mr. Sato estimated that Murata sells $2 to $3 worth of parts to most Chinese smartphone makers per handset. Given that Xiaomi alone has forecast shipments of 60 million phones in 2014 and 100 million next year, that is a solid source of revenue. Apple, which uses more capacitors, as well as other parts that Chinese makers don¡¦t generally source from Murata, buys about $9 to $10 worth of Murata parts for every iPhone, Mr. Sato estimated.
Murata¡¦s sales of parts to smartphone makers and other suppliers of communications gear rose about 90% over the past five years, to ?430 billion in the year ended March 31, boosting overall sales by about 60%, to ?847 billion.
The Kyoto area, also home to parts makers like Rohm Semiconductor, Nidec Corp. and Kyocera Corp., has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Chinese smartphone boom. TDK, which is based in Tokyo and makes capacitors and other parts, says its sales to Chinese smartphone makers rose 50% in the April-June quarter.
The push to automate smartphone assembly plants in China, including those making phones for non-Chinese brands, is providing a further boost to Japanese suppliers. Fanuc Corp., a maker of industrial robots that is based in the shadow of Mount Fuji, in September sharply upgraded its forecast for sales and earnings in the financial year ending in March by 29% and 26%, respectively.
Katsushi Saito, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said increased orders for plants owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which operates under the trade name Foxconn Technology Group and is a major assembler of Apple and Xiaomi phones, was the likely reason.
A spokesman for Fanuc said he couldn¡¦t disclose the names of the company¡¦s clients. Apple didn¡¦t respond to a request for comment. Xiaomi and Foxconn declined to comment.
Much of the growth in demand for parts this year was linked to China¡¦s rollout of high-speed networks and the handsets that operate on them.
Japanese parts suppliers have also benefited from the recent weakness of the Japanese yen, which reduces a price gap with competitors in South Korea and China.
Like other parts suppliers, Murata is looking beyond the boom in Chinese smartphones to new markets like wearable technology, as well as existing industries with a growing appetite for precision electronics parts, such as the automotive and health-care businesses, Mr. Murata said.

Taiwan Semiconductor¡¦s Chang on the Evolving Chip Industry; Morris Chang Talks About Preparing for the Internet of Things

Morris Chang, the 83-year-old chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., has made bold bets in the past three decades running the world¡¦s biggest contract chip maker.
He founded Taiwan-based TSMC in 1987 when outsourcing production wasn¡¦t a proven business model in the semiconductor industry. Many chip companies at the time, from Intel Corp. to Texas Instruments Inc., invested billions of dollars in their own chip factories. TSMC¡¦s ¡§foundry¡¨ model of manufacturing chips based on others¡¦ designs, however, challenged this conventional business model.
The outsourcing model soon attracted followers including Santa Clara, Calif.-based GlobalFoundries and China¡¦s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co.
TSMC now is the largest contract manufacturer of computing chips in the world. It has hundreds of clients including Qualcomm Inc., ARM Holdings PLC and Apple Inc. Last year, its revenue totaled almost $20 billion, more than four times what Samsung Electronics Co., the world¡¦s biggest memory-chip maker by revenue, made from contract manufacturing.
But Samsung is coming on strong, and Mr. Chang says TSMC will lose some orders to Samsung next year, when the South Korean chip maker launches its next-generation chip technology. The race will remain heated and is becoming more expensive.
Mr. Chang is also preparing to hand over the reins to his two co-chief executives, CC Wei and Mark Liu.
In an interview at the company¡¦s headquarters in Hsinchu City, south of Taipei, Mr. Chang talked about the challenges TSMC faces. Edited excerpts follow:
Keeping Up
WSJ: At 83, you are one of the rare executives in the tech industry still running a company. How do you keep up with the fast-changing technology, products and market demand?
MR. CHANG: Certainly I don¡¦t make decisions alone. I have experts who advise on technical issues. I have a special team, called the business-development group. They basically tell us and the R&D team what products customers want. Their input is very important to my strategy.
We also have a very realistic market-forecasting group. Now, I still get weekly reports on markets, competition and customers from our vice presidents. Every weekend I spend hours reading reports from them. I¡¦m a very good listener; I get more out of a conversation than most people do.
WSJ: What is the biggest challenge you¡¦re faced with now?
MR. CHANG: Over the next three to five years, we will have to prolong Moore¡¦s law. [Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel Corp., said in 1965 that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years.] We know how to sustain this for the next five years, but after that I don¡¦t know what to do at this point.
WSJ: TSMC has the largest market share among contract chip makers and managed to lift revenue to new highs each year since 2010. What¡¦s key to maintaining competitiveness?
MR. CHANG: You have to be a leader and galvanize resources to take maximum advantage of a changing external environment. If you¡¦re behind by one year, two years, that¡¦s not good.
We¡¦ve pretty much tripled our budget on research and development and have more than doubled our staff over the past five years. Our annual capital spending between 2002 and 2009 stayed at $2.5 billion; since then, it has risen to $10 billion. We try to utilize our equipment fully all the time, which also explains our profitability.
Our share of the global foundry market is expected to rise from 45% in 2012 to 55% in 2015.
Internet of Things
WSJ: How do you think the semiconductor industry will evolve in three to five years?
MR. CHANG: The Internet of Things is all about connectivity. It¡¦s our mission to provide the capacity and technology to all of those so-called IoT devices, including sensors. I imagine semiconductors will be more pervasive than cars. I have no doubt that people will make a good living out of it.
WSJ: How do you retain staff when companies in China and South Korea for example are offering more competitive salaries?
MR. CHANG: Our staff turnover is quite low; it¡¦s less than 5%. That certainly helps build the organization and a stable relationship with customers. We have a pretty good profit-sharing scheme. Taiwan still enjoys a good supply of hardworking, young engineers. We¡¦ve actually hired a few experienced people from outside Taiwan as well to work on a more advanced chip-manufacturing process.
WSJ: Will you consider looking for a successor outside TSMC?
MR. CHANG: I don¡¦t think that will work. People inside TSMC wouldn't like that idea.
WSJ: How do you see the competition?
MR. CHANG: Competition is always heated in technological innovation and will remain so at least over the next three to five years.
Earlier this year, we were honest with our customers and told them our schedule to ramp up on 16-nanometer [16 billionths of a meter] technology will be later than Samsung¡¦s comparable 14-nanometer technology. They appreciated our honesty and made plans accordingly.
So in 2015, Samsung¡¦s market share in the latest production process will be higher than ours, but we will regain market leadership in that segment in 2016. Feedback from customers is good, and that¡¦s why I¡¦m so confident.
China Rising
WSJ: Where will the next round of competition come from?
MR. CHANG: China. The country has the manpower, and it is becoming more talented. Many of them have studied abroad, especially in the U.S. As in the semiconductor industry, the government is heavily subsidizing the sector, and its competitiveness is improving very quickly. Electronics brands like Huawei and Lenovo are also growing as smartphones and tablets are becoming more common, while Internet companies such as Alibaba and Tencent are expanding at a very fast pace.
WSJ: So, how can CEOs prepare for that competition?
MR. CHANG: Technology and patents are a company¡¦s biggest and most important assets, and we should protect them. Selling them for short-term gains is very unwise. Intellectual property is a long-term competitive advantage.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Review: The worst of both Mao and markets

(Refiles to add dropped word in paragraph two.) (The author is a guest columnist. The opinions expressed are his own)
By Edward Chancellor
London, Oct 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Has the impetus for economic reform in China ground to a halt? Many China-watchers think so, citing state banks' favouritism of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the continuing monopoly power of state-owned "national champions", and the effects of the massive fiscal and credit stimulus launched after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. Nicholas Lardy will have none of this.
In his new book, "Markets over Mao: The Rise of Private Business in China", Lardy, a veteran China economist at the Peterson Institute, argues that the private sector in China continues to grow at the expense of the state-controlled parts of the economy. The data supports his claims. The trouble is that since Chinese national statistics are generally vague and sometimes downright unreliable, they can be used to justify wildly contrasting views of China's economy.
There is no disagreement that the private sector in China has grown marvellously since economic reforms were initiated in the late 1970s. The markets for labour and the vast majority of inputs have been liberalised. There has been a huge influx of foreign investment. Private firms now account for around two-thirds of China's economic output and an even greater share of industrial and manufacturing production.
Lardy doesn't believe that China's state-owned sector poses much of a threat to this free market paradise. He points out that the SOEs were severely culled in the late 1990s. Many of the sectors which remain under Chinese state control - such as energy, telecoms and utilities - have traditionally been under national ownership in most Western countries. Although the largest banks remain in state hands, their share of financial assets has steadily declined.
Besides, as Lardy observes, private Chinese companies with poor access to bank credit have used retained profits to fund their growth. Most contentiously, he says that state-owned enterprises haven't crowded private firms out of the credit markets. In recent years, the supply of credit to the private sector has actually outpaced the growth in lending to SOEs.
According to Lardy, the evidence suggests that private firms "grow faster, employ capital more efficiently, create more jobs, and increasingly generate more exports than state firms". Just how robust is this "evidence"?
MIT economist Yasheng Huang has claimed that the size of China's private sector is overstated in the national statistics. Many "shareholding" and "limited liability" firms, generally viewed as private, are in fact state-controlled. This makes a huge difference. Adjusting for that, the private sector's share of fixed asset investment in 2012 was not 64 percent but just 29 percent.
Chinese economic statistics can drive just about anyone crazy. But Lardy misses a far more important point. In modern China, the line between "private" and "public" has always been fuzzy and has often shifted. The fast-growing Township and Village Enterprises were generally deemed public in the 1980s. They later morphed into private enterprises, when their bosses no longer felt that they had to escape the opprobrium that was attached to "capitalist roaders."
Today, it's still not clear whether even well-known Chinese companies are truly private or public. Lardy cites Lenovo as a private concern. Yet the computer maker came out of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is categorised in OECD documents as "state-owned." Lenovo was incorporated in Hong Kong, and thus also qualifies as a "foreign invested enterprise." The ownership status of Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment firm, which has been dogged by claims of association with China's military, is even more contentious.
The confusion is a consequence of China remaining an authoritarian single-party state which suffers from endemic corruption. This is crony capitalism, where everything is up for grabs and there is no clear-cut distinction between public and private. Connections with leading Communist Party members and their families appear to be vital to business success. Even Alibaba, the internet giant often praised as a private sector success story, is not exempt. As The New York Times recently pointed out, four companies invested in Alibaba prior to its IPO have had executives who were scions of former Politburo members. But reliance on protection that comes from distributing shares to princelings is hardly a triumph of the market.
China's institutions have not advanced in line with the country's economic development. There is still no rule of law, no judicial independence, no absolute protection of property rights and no impartial enforcement of contracts by the state. Regulation is often arbitrary and fosters rent-seeking. Successful entrepreneurs are vulnerable to expropriation by Party cadres and their cronies.
Even when the private sector is gaining ground, the state's influence is huge. Lardy notes that private outfits are doing well in steel, mining and construction sectors, at the expense of state-owned companies. Private firms have also taken a greater share of credit supplied by the burgeoning shadow banking sector.
Yet all these developments are linked to China's epic property boom. Given that all land in China is ultimately owned by the state, that the government has expropriated land from tens of millions of people for development, that the real estate boom has fostered graft on a legendary scale, and that China's property bubble is in large part a product of artificially low interest rates delivered by the central bank and propelled by the government's post-crisis stimulus, this recent expansion of the private sector is not the product of laissez-faire policies.
Nor is it sustainable. China's economy today resembles not so much Lardy's "markets over Mao" as the worst of both worlds.

Google¡¦s Results Disappoint on Slowdown in Paid Clicks; Search Giant Has Spent Heavily on Hiring, Building Data Centers

Slower growth in advertising, heavy spending and a higher tax bill led to disappointing quarterly results for Google Inc., denting shares of the Internet-search giant.
Google said third-quarter revenue totaled $16.52 billion, up 20% from a year earlier, but shy of the $16.58 billion expected by analysts, according to S&P Capital IQ.
Net income fell 5.3%, to $2.81 billion, or $4.09 a share, from $2.97 billion, or $4.38 a share, in the same period of 2013. Those results include Google¡¦s Motorola Mobility unit, which it is selling to China¡¦s Lenovo Group Ltd., and classifies as a discontinued operation.
Excluding Motorola and certain other expenses, Google reported earnings per share of $6.35. Analysts had expected $6.53 on that basis, according to S&P Capital IQ.
Google is the leading online advertising company because its dominant search engine gives marketers valuable clues on what people want. That has fueled steady growth in revenue and profit in recent years. But the company is spending heavily as it invests in new businesses to maintain growth.
Such spending hurts short-term results and sparks concern among some analysts on Wall Street. While revenue increased 20% in the latest quarter, expenses climbed 28%. Among expenses, research and development costs soared 46%.
Google is also spending to build additional data centers to deliver more Internet content. Capital expenditures totaled $7.4 billion through the first nine months of the year, up 45% from $5.1 billion in the same period last year.
Hiring continues at a rapid clip. Excluding Motorola, the company added 2,980 employees in the third quarter, to 51,564.
¡§There is a gap between expectations on the part of many investors and the reality of Google¡¦s trajectory on expense growth,¡¨ said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.
Google¡¦s search-advertising business remains profitable, but its newer ventures¡Xincluding display advertising, online video site YouTube and longer-term projects like delivering Internet service from high-altitude balloons¡Xhave lower profit margins, Mr. Wieser said.
Google shares fell 2% to $525.90 in after-hours trading Thursday, following the results. In 4 p.m. trading, shares fell $3.81, or 0.7%, to $536.92.
Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Co., highlighted Google¡¦s increased spending on acquisitions and its recent expansion of Google Express, a same-day delivery service, which he described as ¡§very asset intensive.¡¨
¡§Return on investment is very far off, so near-term margins could be impacted,¡¨ Mr. Sinha added.
Google¡¦s third-quarter profit was knocked by a tax bill that climbed by 40% to $859 million. A nondeductible impairment charge related to Motorola patents affected the tax rate, the company said.
Google¡¦s revenue growth also caused concern among some analysts. Excluding currency fluctuations, revenue increased 19% year-over-year. That broke several quarters of revenue growth at or above 20%.
¡§Things were a little bit slower than everyone was expecting,¡¨ said Steve Weinstein, an analyst at ITG Investment Research.
Messrs. Sinha and Weinstein pointed the finger at growth in the number of paid clicks on Google ads.
Google said paid clicks rose 17% in the third quarter, a deceleration from closer to 30% growth in recent quarters. Analysts had expected growth of about 20%.
Google made changes in the third quarter that reduced some paid clicks that were ¡§lower quality,¡¨ Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette told analysts during a conference call. However, those changes also improved the price paid for those clicks on mobile devices, he added. The executive didn¡¦t elaborate on the specific changes.
¡§We continue to be excited about the growth in our advertising and emerging businesses,¡¨ Mr. Pichette said.
Clicks on the sites Google owns, like Google.com, continued to grow nicely, at a rate of 24%. But clicks on Google ads on other sites rose only 2% from the prior year.
Google has been de-emphasizing clicks on other sites as these are sometimes seen by advertisers as being less valuable.
On the other hand, the revenue Google collects from each click, which typically declines, fell at a slower rate. The so-called cost per click fell just 2% from the same period a year ago, and has stayed roughly flat the past three quarters.

Google Unveils Nexus 6 Phone to Rival iPhone 6; New $649 Smartphone Has 5.9-Inch Screen; Google Also Unveils Tablet, Set-Top Box

Google Inc. unveiled threeNexus-branded devices on Wednesday, signaling plans to compete with Apple Inc. for high-end consumers.
Google¡¦s new Nexus 6 smartphone, Nexus 9 tablet and Nexus Player set-top box are priced slightly below, or in line with, competing devices from Apple. In the past, Google has priced new models significantly below Apple products. That is a departure for Google, which in the past has priced new models significantly below Apple products.
Google also said it would introduce a new version of its Android operating system, dubbed Android L, for Lollipop, next month.
Unlike Apple, Google licenses its operating system to other phone makers. With the new releases, Google aims to compete more with Apple at the premium end of the mobile-device market and help partners churn out cheap handsets for developing markets.
¡§We deeply respect what Apple is doing, but we take a very different approach,¡¨ said Sundar Pichai, who runs Google¡¦s Android, Chrome and Apps businesses. ¡§With Android L, we wanted to show the entire spectrum.¡¨
Android powered 85% of smartphones shipped globally in the second quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. But in developed markets, such as the U.S., Apple devices remain popular with more affluent customers. That gives Apple an advantage because its users spend more on applications, encouraging developers to work on its platform first.
Google¡¦s three new devices can be preordered online later this week. The phone will be sold in 27 countries and will be in stores in November.
At 5.9 inches diagonally, the Nexus 6 is larger than Apple¡¦s new iPhone 6 Plus, which measures 5.5 inches. It will sell for $649, compared with $749 for the iPhone 6 Plus. Last year, Google introduced the Nexus 5 at $349.
Mr. Pichai said the goal of Nexus products isn¡¦t to sell lots of devices, but to provide a ¡§road map¡¨ to help other Android device makers, such as Samsung Electronics Co., develop similar products.
The Nexus 6 will be available through the four major U.S. wireless carriers and sold in their stores, with two-year contracts and monthly installment plans that reduce the upfront cost of the device, Mr. Pichai said. Verizon Communications Inc. didn¡¦t carry the two most recent Nexus phones.
The Nexus 6 smartphone is made by Motorola Mobility, the handset manufacturer that Google is selling to China¡¦s Lenovo Group.
The Nexus 9 tablet, made by HTC Corp., features an 8.9-inch screen and starts at $399. An optional keyboard cover costs $129. It will be available in 30 countries and in stores next month. Google hopes the Nexus 9 can substitute for laptops in some work situations. Microsoft Corp. has tried that strategy with its Surface tablet, but it has failed to catch on with lots of consumers. Mr. Pichai said many people already use Android tablets, which should help get the Nexus 9 adopted in the office and on business trips.
The Nexus 9¡¦s $399 starting price is also close to what Apple charges for its iPads. The 9.7-inch tablets from Apple start at $399 and the latest iPad Air tablet starts $499. Apple is expected to unveil new iPads Thursday.
The Nexus Player is a small set-top box shaped like a hockey puck that connects to TVs and uses Wi-Fi to stream movies and TV shows. It doubles as a gaming console, letting users play Android games on a larger screen. Asustek Computer Inc. made the gadget.
The set-top box costs $99 and will be sold in the U.S. and Canada through Google¡¦s Play store in early November. That matches Apple¡¦s $99 set-top box, Apple TV. The Nexus Player has an optional game controller that costs $39.99.

Personal-computer and smartphone maker Lenovo Group Ltd. said it would create a new company in China next year that focuses on selling mobile phones online.
The new smartphone company, which will have a different brand name, is part of Lenovo¡¦s efforts to fend off fierce competition in China from Xiaomi Inc., a local smartphone startup that sells its handsets online while cultivating its fan base through its own software, services and entertainment offerings. Xiaomi is also known for being marketing savvy, engaging with consumers through online forums and social networks.
Lenovo said in a statement Wednesday that it will continue to sell Lenovo-branded phones in China through local carriers and retailers.
The new smartphone company, which will start its operation April 1, 2015, won't only sell devices online but will also offer applications and focus on consumer engagement, Lenovo said.
Lenovo, which last year overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. as the world¡¦s largest PC maker, has been quickly expanding its smartphone business for the past year. In the second quarter, Lenovo was the world¡¦s fourth-largest smartphone maker by shipments behind Samsung, Apple and Huawei Technologies Co., according to IDC.
Lenovo and Xiaomi are two of the biggest smartphone makers in China, both selling more phones in the market than Samsung Electronics Co. or Apple Inc.
In recent quarters, Lenovo and Xiaomi have been competing intensely against each other for the number-one position by shipments.
Lenovo¡¦s plans to set up a new mobile phone business comes as the company is in the process of completing a $2.91 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in the U.S.
But Lenovo said that the new smartphone company will be a China-focused company.

* Fed's Tarullo says downside risks to global economy

SHANGHAI, Oct 13 (Reuters) - China and Hong Kong shares dropped on Monday, taking their cues from weakness in global markets as concerns mount over the health of major economies.               
By midday, the Shanghai Composite Index declined 1 percent to 2,351.39 points, set for the biggest percentage fall since Sept. 22, while the CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also dropped 1 percent.               
The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.6 percent to 22,940.82 points. The China Enterprises Index of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong fell 1 percent.               
Analysts said the drop in Hong Kong was due to weakness in overseas markets but further declines were likely to be limited as investors await upcoming Chinese economic data over the next two weeks.               
"Investors are not too bullish or bearish at this moment," said Alex Wong, a director at Ample Finance Group in Hong Kong. "They are cautious and taking a wait-and-see attitude."               
Highlighting worries over the global economy, Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said on Saturday that downside risks to the global economy was a factor that U.S. monetary policy would need to take into account even as the American economy recovers.               
Among top losers in the Hong Kong market, PetroChina  dipped 2.3 percent, Kunlun Energy dropped 3.6 percent, and Lenovo Group fell 3.6 percent.               
Chinese developer Agile Property Holdings Ltd.  resumed trading on Monday after a week-long suspension. Its shares plunged 20.8 percent by midday after the company said on Friday that its chairman had been detained.               
On the mainland, shares were weighed down after 16 companies published initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses over the weekend, analysts said.               
"Investors are locking up money to prepare to buy new shares," said Zhang Yanbin, analyst at Zheshang Securities in Shanghai.

* ChinaSoft thriving on cloud computing boost -CEO
* Profit surged over 40 pct in first half
* All countries want to secure vital IT sectors -CEO
By Matthew Miller
BEIJING, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Although Microsoft Corp is among U.S. technology firms caught up in Chinese security worries and antitrust probes, a local software company in which the Seattle giant is a strategic investor is riding high on the growth of cloud computing.
The chief executive of ChinaSoft International Ltd , 5 percent-owned by Microsoft, says that's more down to native firms latching on to global trends like the cloud, than Beijing policies cutting into orders from state enterprises for foreign players' goods.
A leading Microsoft distributor in China, selling IT systems and outsourcing services, ChinaSoft saw first-half profit jump 43 percent to 115 million yuan ($19 million). Founded as an $81,000 start-up spun out of a government firm, Hong Kong-listed ChinaSoft is now worth more than $600 million.
"The biggest change has been the arrival of the cloud, and the impact of cloud computing," Chen said in an interview with Reuters. China's spending on cloud services rocketed to 80.4 billion yuan ($13 billion) in 2013, according to the China Software Testing Center, and the market is expected to grow at a better than 60 percent clip over the next three years as local firms move away from storing data on in-house servers.
The challenge for foreign tech firms "hasn't been China" per se, the CEO said, referring to a perception that China's government is unique in supporting Chinese IT companies and cloud services providers.
"All countries want (to secure) their most vital sectors with their own systems," said Chen, whose 15 percent stake in the Beijing-based company is worth close to $100 million. "It's the same for the United States."
STATE SPENDING
Foreign companies, particularly U.S. technology firms, have come under increasing scrutiny in China as Beijing pushes hard on information security in the wake of last year's cyber espionage revelations by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Firms from Microsoft to IBM Corp have seen China sales slip as state-run firms have taken their business elsewhere.
Chen attributes ChinaSoft's success to serving rising demand from businesses for social, mobile, application and cloud services requested by their clients. That's taking place against a backdrop of a burgeoning domestic market, where the government is supporting the development of local software and security technology.
With China's state-owned business sector marshalling a huge capital spending budget, companies local and foreign court their business. ChinaSoft, which rolled out various government platforms more than a decade ago, has long-standing relationships with many central government ministries and localities.
It also counts state-owned firms like China Mobile Communications Corp, State Grid Corp of China and China UnionPay as clients. Newly listed e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding is a strategic partner.
About 50 percent of revenue is tied to state-owned firms and the government, while revenue attributed to all Microsoft products and services accounted for about 7 percent of sales in first-half 2014. Revenue attributed to Microsoft goods and services in China alone fell.
Microsoft officials in the United States declined to comment for this story. The company doesn't disclose revenue figures for China, nor say if sales are rising or falling. According to one official company presentation, China revenue exceeded $1 billion in 2013.
OVERSEAS AMBITIONS
Since the start of the year, ChinaSoft has seen its share price gain more than 30 percent. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index is off nearly 1 percent this year.
It has other powerful backers besides Microsoft: Hony Capital, the private equity firm backed by Legend Holdings, now holds a leading 17.85 percent stake. Legend Holdings is the largest investor in fast-growing computer and smartphone maker Lenovo Group Ltd.
Now, even as its China business grows, ChinaSoft is pressing on with international expansion and expanding outsourcing and consulting services.
Last November, it spent a reported $41 million to buy-out Austin, Texas-based consultancy Catapult Systems LLC, to extend its Microsoft integration services globally. Chen said he expects international revenue to increase to 30 percent of sales within the next five years, from 20 percent last year.
ChinaSoft also is growing its distribution through a joint venture with Huawei Technologies Co, the telecom equipment giant, to provide more outsourcing services, including management of Huawei's cloud-based payment system.
ChinaSoft has set its sights on more than doubling its overall revenue to 10 billion yuan by 2015. Despite ChinaSoft's expanding sales, the company only achieved profit margins of 6.2 percent last year - weak for an industry where margins are usually much stronger.
The rapid growth of ChinaSoft's workforce - staff has more than doubled since 2010 alone and now stands at 23,000 - and rising labor costs are part of the problem, Chen said. "Our goal now is to get (margins) back to 10 percent".
The executive said ChinaSoft's success in building a more profitable business will depend on management discipline in competing against overseas services companies, including Accenture Plc and IBM.
"We need to show our customers that we have the same service capabilities as our foreign counterparts," Chen said. (1 US dollar = 6.1308 Chinese yuan)

Larger Apple iPad to Be Delayed; Apple Suppliers Concentrating on Meeting Demand for New iPhones

Apple Inc. suppliers have pushed back plans to mass produce a larger-screen tablet to early next year, people familiar with the matter said, as they struggle to make enough new iPhones to meet strong demand.
Suppliers of the Cupertino, Calif., company had originally planned to produce the larger iPad in mass volume beginning in December, the people said.
¡§The top priority for the supply chain is to meet the overwhelming demand for the larger screen iPhones. The output of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus remains unsatisfactory,¡¨ said a person at a supplier. ¡§It would be challenging for display makers to split resources and spend a few months to ramp up production for a new larger screen iPad now.¡¨
Foxconn Technology Co., a major assembler of Apple¡¦s iPhones and iPads, is also facing the challenge of hiring enough factory workers to assemble the two new iPhones at its largest production site in Zhengzhou, in northern China. At the plant, more than 200,000 workers are dedicated to just making the new iPhones and key components such as metal casings. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is the world¡¦s largest contract manufacturer by revenue and has more than 1 million workers in China assembling electronics for companies including Apple, Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
¡§Everyone is busy with the new iPhones, Foxconn¡¦s bread and butter. Chairman [Terry Gou] has also gone to the Zhengzhou site to monitor the production closely,¡¨ said an official at Foxconn.
Apple said it sold more than 10 million of its new iPhones in its first weekend of availability. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus went on sale in 10 countries on Sept. 19. Apple has expanded to other countries in recent weeks and is expected to start sales of the new handsets in China on Oct. 17. The company is expected to give an update on iPhone sales when it reports results for the quarter ended September, on Oct. 20.
Suppliers in Asia say Apple¡¦s larger tablet will likely have a 12.9-inch liquid-crystal-display screen with resolution that is similar to the current 9.7-inch iPad Air unveiled in October last year.
Apple said on Wednesday it was hosting a media event on Oct. 16. While the media invite didn¡¦t say what will be discussed, it is expected that Apple will unveil new iPads and iMacs. It remains unclear if the company will unveil plans for the larger iPad at the event and Apple declined to comment.
Apple¡¦s plans for a larger iPad come as the company¡¦s tablet business is showing signs of slowing. Unit sales of iPads have fallen for two straight quarters, while revenue from tablets has fallen on a year-to-year basis for four of the past five quarters.
It would be the first time Apple unveils a bigger screen iPad, following its move to launch bigger-screen iPhones last month to counter competition from rivals like Samsung Electronics Co. which popularized the big-screen mobile devices. As early as last year, Apple was testing larger screens for its smartphones and tablets.
Apple introduced a smaller iPad¡Xthe 7.9-inch iPad Mini¡Xin late 2012 as it tried to offer different sizes to compete in the tablet market.
Data from research firm IDC shows Apple¡¦s share of the global tablet market has slipped to 26.9% in the second quarter from 33% a year earlier. Samsung¡¦s share of the tablet market also fell to 17.2% from 18.8% as both companies have been facing rising competition from other Chinese vendors including Lenovo Group Ltd.
Apple has continued to expand its customer base with new products and refinements of current ones.
Suppliers are also preparing for mass production of a 12-inch MacBook Air in December, featuring a higher resolution display, people familiar with the matter said. The current MacBook Air comes in two different sizes: 11-inch and 13-inch models.
Amid a technological sea change from desktop computers to mobile devices, Apple aims to position the iPad as the computing product for a new generation of workers. In July, Apple struck a partnership with International Business Machines Corp. to develop applications targeted at different industries. Under the partnership, IBM also plans to sell iPhones and iPads to its corporate clients.
¡§If Apple were to launch a larger iPad, it would need to make better use of the screen real estate. Introducing better multitasking capabilities would certainly drive interest,¡¨ said Tim Coulling, analyst at Canalys.

About 1,000 workers at a Foxconn Technology Co. plant in southwest China assembling printers and computers for companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. went on strike for several hours this week demanding higher pay.
The Taiwan-based company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., said the workers walked off the job for four hours Wednesday at its production site in Chongqing. About 20 workers went on strike Thursday morning, but further details on that stoppage weren¡¦t available.
Foxconn is working with its labor union and workers to resolve the dispute, the company said Thursday in a statement. The company said the strikes didn¡¦t disrupt production.
Management ¡§continuously increased production volumes, and even required individual workers to take on tasks that used to require two workers to handle. The increase in workload wasn¡¦t compensated,¡¨ said one worker who declined to be named. He said he participated in the strike.
¡§Some workers are not happy because the company [Foxconn] has reduced overtime hours, a key component of their salaries,¡¨ after H-P cut orders, said a Foxconn official who declined to be named. Workers also demanded the resignation of the factory manager, he said. Also, the company had tried to lay off some workers without paying severance, the official added.
Foxconn filed a complaint with the local police, he said. The reason for the complaint wasn¡¦t clear.
On the Weibo social-media service, users distributed images that appeared show hundreds of workers gathered outside the Chongqing facility Wednesday, waving protest banners as police officers looked on. The police presence at the factory continued Thursday, according to the worker.
A Chongqing police spokeswoman, however, said she wasn¡¦t aware of the strike.
Foxconn employs about 30,000 workers at its Chongqing site. The company has more than one million workers in China and is a major supplier to Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp.
The strike came after H-P said earlier this month it planned to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations as it faces intensifying competition from China¡¦s Lenovo Group Ltd.
¡§H-P continuously works to optimize its supply chain in order to maximize production and meet continued customer demand,¡¨ H-P said in a statement. ¡§At times this results in the movement of product lines between supplier factories. When these decisions are made, we work closely with the supplier so they can plan accordingly to minimize the impact to the workers.¡¨

Sony
Company Nearer to Shipping
Videogame Consoles in China
Sony Corp. moved a step closer to shipping videogame consoles in China, as it seeks to join Microsoft Corp. in tapping a market where devices such as PlayStations and Xboxes have long been banned.
According to a filing, a factory in Shanghai¡¦s free-trade zone affiliated with the Japanese electronics company would start packaging consoles in December. The filing said the facility could package 200,000 consoles a year.
A spokesman for Sony said the 200,000 figure doesn¡¦t represent an actual business plan, adding its operation will be based on other factors such as the number of software titles it can sell. He declined to comment further on Sony¡¦s plans.
The filing was an environmental assessment posted by a Sony local partner on the official website of the free-trade zone. It didn¡¦t specify the type of console that would be shipped.
Sony signed a deal earlier this year with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group Co. to make and sell PlayStation game consoles in China. The move came after the Chinese government in September lifted a 14-year ban on the sale of videogame consoles in the country. Microsoft began selling its Xbox One through the free-trade zone late last month. China has long kept a tight leash on the videogame industry out of concern about violent content. The Xbox One titles approved for sale don¡¦t include violent games such as the ¡§Halo¡¨ and ¡§Call of Duty¡¨ titles.
The filing was reported by local media in August and on Thursday by Bloomberg News.

PepsiCo
Company Raises Forecast
PepsiCo Inc. reported better-than-expected third-quarter results despite continued volatility in emerging markets and sluggish consumer demand in developed markets.
Shares of Pepsi, up 18% over the past year, were up 33 cents at $94.27 on Thursday afternoon. The snacks and beverage maker also raised its earnings view for the year, based on its results for the first three quarters. The company now expects core per-share earnings growth of 9%, up from its prior view of 8% growth.
Pepsi has relied on its snack business lately to offset the impact of weaker demand for soda. Sales of diet soda are declining in the U.S., while concerns about soft drink consumption and obesity are rising. U.S. consumption of diet soda fell 6.3% last year while regular soda fell 1.7%, according to Beverage Digest.
Carbonated-soft-drink volume in the key North American market declined 1.5% in the third quarter, Pepsi said.
The company this month is launching its newest soft drink, a mid-calorie soda called Pepsi True, which will be sold exclusively through Amazon.com Inc.
Chairman and Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said the company still faces a challenging macroeconomic environment, including heightened volatility in emerging markets and weak demand in advanced markets.
Pepsi has batted away calls from activist investor Nelson Peltz¡¦s Trian Fund Management LP to break up the company¡¦s snack and beverages businesses, saying it is stronger with both together. PepsiCo has been losing market share to chief drinks rival Coca-Cola Co. for several years in the U.S. and abroad.
For the period ended Sept. 6, Pepsi reported a profit of $2.01 billion, up from $1.92 billion a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to $1.32 from $1.23. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges and other items, earnings were $1.36 a share. Revenue edged up 1.8% to $17.22 billion.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected earnings of $1.29 a share and revenue of $17.07 billion.
Gross margin expanded to 53.6% from 53%.
In its Americas foods business, Frito-Lay North America sales rose 3%. Latin America foods sales climbed 6%, though Quaker Foods North America sales fell 3% on volume declines.
The company¡¦s Americas beverages unit posted flat sales of $5.38 billion, while European revenue fell 1% to $3.76 billion.

Advanced Micro Devices CEO Rory Read Steps Down; Lisa Su Named President, Chief Executive and Board Member

Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a longtime minority player in a key class of computer chips, is shifting leaders as it continues a struggle to bolster its bottom line.
The company said Rory Read has stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer. He will be succeeded by Lisa Su, a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer.
Mr. Read, in a conference call, said the change reflected his regular discussions with AMD¡¦s board about succession issues. ¡§Now is the right time for her to take the reins and continue driving AMD forward,¡¨ he said.
The Sunnyvale, Calif., company since the 1980s has been a distant No. 2 behind Intel Corp. in selling microprocessor chips for personal computers based on a design called x86.
AMD added another major business in 2006 through a $5.4 billion deal to buy ATI Technologies Inc., a specialist in graphics chips that render images in videogames. That transaction saddled the company with a big debt load, a factor in frequent net losses.
Mr. Read, 52 years old, is a former International Business Machines Corp. executive who joined the company from Lenovo Group Ltd., a major chip customer. He pushed to reduce AMD¡¦s debts and diversify its business to reduce its reliance on PC chips and the competition with Intel.
One recent success was convincing Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. to use AMD chips in their latest videogame consoles. Mr. Read also pushed the company to develop chips for server systems based on technology licensed from ARM Holdings PLC that is used in most smartphones and tablets.
But older parts of AMD¡¦s business have been suffering. The company, which once accounted for around a third of the market for x86 chips used in servers, by the second quarter had a share of less than 3% in that market, according to Mercury Research.
Dean McCarron, an analyst at that firm, said AMD¡¦s share of x86 chips for laptops was 9.6%, down from 16.1% in the year-earlier period. AMD¡¦s share price has fallen more than 20% since mid-August. The stock slid 5.5% Wednesday to $3.10 in after-hours trading following news of the management change.
In July, AMD said its second-quarter loss narrowed on improved revenue and lower costs, but the company issued a third-quarter revenue forecast below analysts¡¦ estimates.
Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said Ms. Su is more popular among Wall Street analysts than Mr. Read.
¡§AMD needs growth, and they need it quickly or investors will start to get anxious,¡¨ said Patrick Moorhead, a former AMD executive who now heads the firm Moore Insights & Strategy. ¡§Lisa Su is smart, is respected inside and outside the company and I think projects a look of what people expect as an AMD CEO.¡¨
Ms. Su, another former IBMer, previously worked at Freescale Semiconductor Inc. She is widely credited with deep technical expertise and for helping AMD win deals to place its chips in new gaming consoles, Mr. McCarron said.
She is one of a few female executives at the highest management levels in semiconductors, an industry that relies heavily on electrical engineers. Another exception is Intel President Renee James, who holds the No. 2 spot at that company.
During the conference call, Ms. Su said AMD¡¦s x86 business remains important but indicated she will largely continue Mr. Read¡¦s priorities. ¡§I do very much believe that diversifying our business is critical,¡¨ she said.
Mr. Read said he would support the transition in an advisory role through the end of 2014.

Global PC Shipments Fell in 3rd Quarter; Sales Hurt by Weakness in Emerging Markets; Sales Rose 4% in the U.S.

Sales of personal computers fell in the third quarter as shipments declined in emerging markets and computer upgrades prompted by a Microsoft Corp. policy change slowed.
Growth continued in mature markets, with shipments in the U.S. rising 4%, according to research firms Gartner Inc. and International Data Corp.
Gartner said PC shipments fell 0.5% in the quarter but that positive results in Western Europe and North America could signal a recovery for the industry.
IDC estimated that global shipments declined 1.7%. The firm had forecast a 4.1% decrease.
The third quarter¡Xtypically driven by back-to-school sales and business purchases¡Xbenefited from saturation in the tablet market and increased sales of low-price notebooks. Sales of desktop computers and notebooks have been sluggish in recent years as consumers shifted spending to smartphones and tablets.
Sales comparisons from a year earlier were hurt as companies slowed upgrades they had made in advance of Microsoft ending technical support for Windows XP in April.
Third-quarter shipments increased sharply from year earlier for the top PC makers: Lenovo Group Ltd., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc.
Shipments for market leader Lenovo rose 11%, according to both research firms, increasing the company¡¦s market share to 20%.
Shipments for H-P, which is No. 2 in PC shipments, rose 5%, according to IDC. Gartner said H-P¡¦s shipments rose 4.4%. Dell¡¦s shipments rose 9.7%, both research firms said.
At Acer Inc., which is heavily oriented toward the consumer market, unit sales rose more than 11%, in part because of low volume a year earlier, IDC said. Gartner put Acer¡¦s growth at 9%.
Sales rose 17% for Asustek Computer Inc., according to Gartner, and 8.9% for Apple Inc., according to IDC.
Gartner and IDC have been tracking PC sales since the 1980s.

UPDATE 3-Chipmaker AMD replaces CEO amid loss of market share

Oct 8 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices said Chief Operating Officer Lisa Su would immediately replace Rory Read as chief executive officer as the chipmaker expands beyond its core personal computer market, sending its shares down 6 percent in extended trading.
The transition comes just three years into Read's tenure as CEO and while analysts applauded the leadership change, some of them were surprised at the timing.
"The timing gives pause for concern," said Wedbush analyst Betsy Van Hees. "Earnings are next week and it would have been a much more succinct package to put it all together for us."
AMD, a perennial runner-up to Intel Corp in the business of providing processors for personal computers, has seen its market value nearly halved since Read took over in 2011 as the company lost market share to Intel.
AMD has been expanding into new markets such as game consoles and low-power servers and it aims to obtain half of its revenue from those additional businesses by the end of 2015, but progress has been too slow for many on Wall Street.
"It's hard to point to a near-term catalyst. That's the biggest issue. Every day they get better but it's been a glacial change," said Cody Acree, an analyst at Ascendiant Capital. "Su engenders a lot of confidence and that will resonate nicely with investors and with customers."
Asked repeatedly on a conference call about the unexpected timing of AMD's leadership change, Read said it was the result of a long-term succession strategy.
"This is well planned, well understood," Read said.
Read took over at AMD in 2011 as the explosion of mobile devices slammed PC makers and threatened the survival of one of Silicon Valley's oldest chipmakers.
The former Lenovo executive slashed the company's workforce, hired a new senior management team, including Su, and launched AMD's move into new markets, including ARM-based servers, digital signs and medical devices.
Su, who is 44, said her top focus would be on product development and that she would also simplify AMD and sharpen its focus. She joined AMD in 2012 and is widely seen as one of AMD's most valuable executives.
AMD promoted Su to chief operating officer in June, increasing expectations among investors that she might eventually replace Read.
AMD said its board was discussing with Su the terms of her employment. She is currently paid an annual base salary of $650,000, the company said.
Read, 52, will remain with the company in an advisory role until the end of the year.
AMD's shares were trading at $3.06 after the bell. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had fallen 15 percent this year. (Reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco and Soham Chatterjee in Bangalore; Editing by Kirti Pandey and Lisa Shumaker)

SEATTLE, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Personal computer shipments fell
1.7 percent in the July to September period from a year ago,
tech research firm IDC said on Wednesday, marking the 10th
straight quarter of declines but beating IDC's forecast of a 4.1
percent drop. 
    Gartner, a rival research firm, put the decline at 0.5
percent.
    IDC's 1.7 percent decrease matches the April to June
quarter, equaling the smallest decline since PC shipments
started tumbling in early 2012 as sales of netbooks collapsed in
the face of new competition from tablets. 
    U.S. and European shipments increased, boosted by companies
buying PCs in bulk, which helped the top three PC makers Lenovo
, Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell make market share
gains. But shipments in Asia, the world's biggest computer
market, continued to decline, offsetting the gains in other
areas.

BREAKINGVIEWS-HP closing in on valuation problem, not its future

By Robert Cyran
NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Hewlett-Packard's plan to split in two leaves it just 10 percent undervalued and looking for a future. Over the past three years, Chief Executive Meg Whitman has boosted the tech conglomerate and its stock by refraining from acquisitions, paying off debt and firing employees. Spinning off its PC and printer business should close the firm's stubborn conglomerate discount. But the harder part - avoiding obsolescence - still awaits resolution.
Though the company's PC and printing businesses are cash cows, their future is bleak. PC sales have stabilized after years of decline, but tablets may renew their assault on the market, and computer prices will continue to fall. Meanwhile, the growth of mobile devices and internet services give consumers fewer reasons to print stuff out. HP sold about $32 billion of computers last year and $24 billion of printers and ink. Put these on the sales multiples of Lenovo and Lexmark, and the two are worth almost $9 billion and $15 billion respectively.
HP's remaining operations are more promising. Its enterprise group sold about $28 billion of storage and servers. Put that on the same multiple as rival NetApp, and it would be worth about $41 billion. The enterprise software business, with $4 billion of revenue, has a value of perhaps $12 billion based on the valuations achieved by peers. And HP's troubled services business is worth maybe $6 billion based on rival Unisys . Add it all up, subtract $5 billion of net debt, and HP should be worth about $78 billion - or more than 10 percent higher than its current market cap.
That's encouraging, but financial engineering and Whitman's other efforts don't address HP's more existential problem. It has missed big technological shifts, such as mobile, hardware virtualization, and cloud computing. Sales should shrink again this year, both across the company and in most divisions. Cutting costs has delivered profits, but their size and durability must be taken with a grain of salt - HP has had exceptional charges for at least 20 quarters in a row.
Splitting the company should create two more nimble operators who are less prone to squander the next big opportunities that come along. That's the company's biggest hope. Unfortunately for shareholders, few companies - big or small - ever leap to the edge of new technologies once they've fallen far behind.

Hewlett-Packard: Will Slimmer Make Stronger?; CEO Meg Whitman Says Breakup Makes Firm Nimbler, but the Same Pricing, Competition Problems Persist

Large companies can benefit by breaking up into smaller pieces, but Hewlett-Packard Co.¡¦s split exposes an uncomfortable reality for Chief Executive Meg Whitman: Her new, slimmed-down company will be on no steadier footing than the current H-P.
H-P said Monday it will cleave itself in half. The new HP Inc. will carry on H-P¡¦s personal computer and printing operations while milking them for cash.
The other part, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, will sell H-P¡¦s products and services for large companies, including computer servers, data-storage equipment, software and consulting.
In a conference call announcing the breakup, the company billed Hewlett-Packard Enterprise as a growth engine. However, that side of H-P, which Ms. Whitman is slated to run, is stalled. Revenue in the enterprise portions of H-P slipped 3.2% in the nine months ended July 31, compared with a year earlier. Earnings before taxes fell 6%.
Ms. Whitman said the breakup would make the new company more nimble and enable it to invest in products and acquisitions to better address its market.
In an interview Monday, Ms. Whitman said the breakup would sharpen executives¡¦ ability to attack the enterprise company¡¦s challenges. ¡§I believe that this focus will actually help us,¡¨ she said.
The new company¡Xlike the current H-P businesses it absorbs¡Xwill be squeezed by price-chopping hardware vendors such as Lenovo Group Ltd. on one side and high-end software specialists like Oracle Corp. and VMware Inc. on the other.
H-P¡¦s bright spots are in areas like so-called converged systems, or hardware platforms that unite storage, networking and computing. And H-P is a promising new entrant in networking gear that funnels Internet traffic, putting pressure on market leader Cisco Systems Inc., said Neil MacDonald, vice president at Gartner.
The catch, he said, is Ms. Whitman¡¦s enterprise company will need more money to invest in or buy its way into other emerging areas of business technology. She no longer will have the steady flow of cash generated by the PC and printing group.
¡§H-P on the enterprise side, they¡¦ve been behind the eight ball. The jury is still out as to what this strategic move does for their growth,¡¨ said Daniel Ives, a technology analyst with FBR Capital Markets.
Wall Street reacted warmly to H-P¡¦s breakup, as it did to eBay Inc.¡¦s announcement last week to split its auction business from the PayPalpayments business. H-P shares rose 4.7% Monday to $36.87.
However, where PayPal gained opportunities by separating from eBay, dividing H-P confers few such advantages and may create problems. Without the PC-and-printing operation under the same roof, H-P can¡¦t as easily sell packages of computing gear, servers, consulting services and software to corporate-technology departments.
The slimmer companies that result also may lose clout and pricing power with suppliers of computer chips and other hardware parts.
The breakup of the 75-year-old Silicon Valley pioneer is the latest in a series of dramatic steps taken by some of the world¡¦s biggest sellers of corporate technology. The current market leaders achieved dominance by displacing formerly entrenched rivals. Now, however, they are threatened by younger competitors as they struggle to adjust to tectonic shifts in how companies buy and use technology.
Larry Ellison stepped down last month from the CEO role at Oracle after 37 years, as his company navigates tumult in its product lines. Michael Dell last fall grew frustrated with investors and led a $25 billion deal to return Dell Inc. to his control. Both Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. in the past 18 months turned to a new generation of leaders for a fresh eye on their challenges.
H-P may not be standing pat after the breakup, either. H-P and data-storage company EMC Corp. recently discussed a potential merger, and a separation of H-P¡¦s PC-and-printer operation was a part of those talks, according to people familiar with the matter.
H-P and EMC could continue to explore a tie-up, though the odds of such a deal ultimately occurring aren¡¦t high, people familiar with the matter said.
Ms. Whitman on Monday declined to address discussions with EMC or other potential merger candidates.
Executives said Monday that H-P was restricted from repurchasing shares of the company¡¦s stock, because it had ¡§material, nonpublic information¡¨¡Xa sign H-P has been discussing acquisitions or sales. People familiar with the matter said the statement referred to possible deals, including with EMC.
If Ms. Whitman keeps the hand she was dealt, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will inherit a tough competitive position.
H-P has been slower than most other corporate-technology sellers in pushing into emerging areas such as cloud computing, mobile technology and services to help organizations modernize.
H-P is the world¡¦s largest seller of the most popular type of computer servers, according to research firm Gartner Inc., but that business is facing lower margins and greater competition.
The H-P division anchored by servers, storage gear and other corporate hardware reported a 7.4% decline in earnings before taxes during the nine months ended July 31.
That division will be Hewlett-Packard Enterprise¡¦s biggest revenue contributor. At the same time, Lenovo and Dell have pledged to win market share in servers.
H-P has introduced software tools to help companies manage their sprawling data centers and link them into clouds.
The company¡¦s high-margin software business remains small and troubled. Software has accounted for less than 4% of H-P¡¦s total revenue, and sales in that business fell during the most recent quarter from a year earlier.
H-P also has acknowledged hiccups in its outsourcing and support operations, which mostly consist of the EDS business H-P bought for $13 billion in 2008. H-P faces a squeeze there, as well, between high-end consulting operations like IBM¡¦s and software exporters such as Wipro Ltd. H-P said revenue from services fell 6.9% over the past nine months.

Hewlett-Packard Set to Break Up 75-Year-Old Company; H-P Would Separate PC, Printer Business from Corporate Hardware, Services; More Layoffs Ahead

Hewlett-Packard Co. confirmed Monday that it planned to split the company into two parts, a move executives said was driven by the need to stay nimble to keep up with rapidly changing technology.
H-P, which Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard famously started in their Palo Alto, Calif., garage in 1939, now will be carved up: One part, HP Inc., will consist of the company¡¦s personal-computer and printer businesses. The other, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, will sell computer servers, data-storage gear, software, consulting operations and other services for corporate-technology departments.
Each of the companies will be about the same size, with more than $50 billion in annual revenue.
H-P Chief Executive Meg Whitman said Monday that the two companies will be on very different courses. The new HP Inc. will be milked for cash, which will be earmarked for returns to stockholders. The enterprise company, which Ms. Whitman will run, will be operated for growth through a faster pace of investment in new products and through acquisitions, executives said on a conference call with analysts.
Investors seemed pleased with the move, as shares of Hewlett-Packard were up 5.9% at $37.28 in afternoon trading Monday. The stock has risen sharply since the beginning of last year, but shares remain well below their highs in recent years¡Xand the even-loftier levels they reached during the 1990s technology boom.
Separately, H-P also boosted Monday the number of expected layoffs it has planned by 5,000 to 55,000, after identifying ¡§incremental opportunities for reductions.¡¨ H-P had previously projected its job cuts to be between 45,000 and 50,000, and it already has shed 36,000 employees under the restructuring program as of the end of the most recent quarter.
Ms. Whitman acknowledged the decision to split the company apart was a reversal for her. Three years ago, when she took over as chief executive, Ms. Whitman nixed a potential spinoff of H-P¡¦s personal-computer business. ¡§Together we are stronger,¡¨ she said in October 2011.
On Monday, Ms. Whitman said it was the right move then for H-P to stay together, in part because the company was too weak financially to go through with a breakup. But she said the company became healthier under her watch, and technology has shifted to favor companies that can move quickly. ¡§Being nimble is the only path to winning,¡¨ Ms. Whitman said on the call.
She also credited H-P for three years of hard work rebuilding its cash stockpile, paying back debt, improving its executive-leadership lineup and introducing new product lines in fast-growing areas such as so-called cloud computing.
¡§Three years ago, you will recall this company was in a fairly difficult position,¡¨ Ms. Whitman said.
Ms. Whitman said H-P¡¦s board started talking in earnest a few months ago about a breakup as part of directors¡¦ annual strategy review. Until very recently, she said, H-P and the board had focused nearly all of their energies on repairing the company¡¦s financial health, restoring the trust of investors and customers, and restocking H-P¡¦s pipeline with new product offerings.
H-P isn¡¦t alone in opting for focus over unity. Auction house eBay Inc. also recently chose to break up for reasons similar to H-P: the belief that corporate operations with different growth outlooks are best managed as separate entities.
H-P said it would make the split through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders by November 2015.
The impending breakup, first reported Sunday by The Wall Street Journal, set off a round of speculation in the industry about whether H-P¡¦s split could lead to more deal-making.
The Journal recently reported that for much of the past year, H-P held talks to merge with data-storage equipment maker EMC Corp., a deal that would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion. Although the talks recently ended, the separation could pave the way for H-P¡¦s corporate hardware and services business to ultimately be combined with EMC, industry observers said.
In a joint interview Monday with The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Whitman and Chief Financial Officer Cathie Lesjak stressed the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise would have the firepower and desire to improve its position through acquisitions. They said any deals would prioritize shareholder returns.
¡§I don¡¦t think it¡¦s binary to say getting smaller is a contradiction to getting bigger,¡¨ Ms. Lesjak said in the interview.
They declined to discuss whether the H-P breakup might be a prelude to renewed deal discussions with data-storage giant EMC.
During a conference call Monday morning, H-P said it needed to hold off on stock repurchases because it was in possession of ¡§material nonpublic information,¡¨ an indication the company was considering acquisitions or sales.
In addition to Ms. Whitman leading Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, she also is slated to be chairman of HP Inc., the personal-computer and printer business. That company¡¦s CEO will be Dion Weisler, a current executive in the PC and printer operation. Current H-P lead independent director Pat Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.
H-P, which affirmed its guidance for the year ending Oct. 31, also said it expects per-share earnings of $3.83 to $4.03 for fiscal 2015. The range doesn¡¦t include one-time charges expected to be connected to the separation. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were projecting $3.95 a share.
In the 2013 fiscal year ended last October, the Printing and Personal Systems Group, as it is known, reported $55.9 billion in revenue, about half of H-P¡¦s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for company revenue as a whole.
Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China¡¦s Lenovo Group Ltd., according to industry research firm IDC.
In response to lower sales and to provide a lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.
Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as cloud software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.
Ms. Whitman and Ms. Lesjak said H-P is working to cut costs and shift sales strategies in its large but struggling tech-consulting business. They said software¡Xwhile a small part of the current H-P¡Xwill be more significant financially and get more attention inside the reformulated Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.
The recent wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world has been fueled by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well received by shareholders¡Xand sometimes actively sought by them.
Last Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay, where Ms. Whitman was once CEO, announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay¡¦s decision, pushing the company¡¦s shares up about 7.5% that day.

Fitch Places Hewlett-Packard's 'A-' IDR on Rating Watch Negative
1,366 words

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the ratings of Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Electronic Data Systems LLC (EDS) on Rating Watch Negative. The placement on Negative Watch follows HP's announced separation into two companies, consisting of HP Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPI). The tax-free spin-off to shareholders is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year (FY) 2015 (Oct. 31). The rating actions affect approximately $26.6 billion of total debt, including the company's undrawn $7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities (RCF). The Rating Watch Negative reflects the loss of business diversity, anticipated greater financial performance volatility at HPE due to lower recurring revenue, risk of dis-synergies, particularly procurement, uncertainty regarding the ultimate liquidity profile and capital structure for HPI and HPE.
 The Negative Watch also reflects minimal strategic rationale for HPI to maintain a strong investment grade rating and greater risk of debt-financed acquisitions at HPE given the loss of considerable FCF generated by HPI. In the latest 12 months (LTM) ended July 31, 2014, Fitch estimates HPI, which will consist of HP's Printing (consumer and commercial hardware, supplies and managed print services) and Personal Systems (consumer and commercial notebooks, desktops, workstations and tablets) segments, generated revenue of $57.2 billion (49% of total HP excluding eliminations), operating profit of $5.4 billion (49% of total HP) and an operating margin of 9.4%. HPE will consist of HP's Enterprise Group (servers, storage, networking and technology services), Enterprise Services (infrastructure technology outsourcing and application and business services), Software, and HPFS segments. In the LTM ended July 31, 2014, Fitch estimates HPE, including corporate investments, generated revenue of $58.6 billion (51% of total HP excluding eliminations), operating profit of $5.8 billion (51% of total HP) and an operating margin of 9.9%. Fitch expects HPI will assume the vast majority of HP's existing core debt, which totaled $9 billion at July 31, 2014. This reflects HPI's lower inorganic growth opportunities and greater and more consistent FCF generation relative to HPE due to lower capital intensity and cash conversion cycle, and greater recurring revenue. At a minimum, HPE will assume all of the debt associated with HP Financial Services (HPFS), which totaled $10.8 billion at July 31, 2014. Fitch believes managing dis-synergies post separation, particularly in procurement, could prove difficult and may place HPI and HPE at a competitive disadvantage relative to larger rivals, such as Lenovo Group (Lenovo) and Dell Inc. (rated 'BB-' with a Stable Outlook). Lenovo became the third largest provider of industry standard servers after it completed the acquisition of IBM's x86 business for $2.1 billion on Oct. 1, 2014. HP expects to offset procurement dis-synergies through joint purchasing agreements and improved nimbleness post separation. Furthermore, HP Financial Services will also continue to provide financing solutions to HPI customers and partners post separation. KEY RATINGS DRIVERS HP's ratings and Outlook reflect: --Significant scale and broad portfolio, which provides purchasing leverage for shared components and strengthens the resiliency of its total revenue; --Solid liquidity provided by nearly $14.5 billion of cash (primarily offshore), $7.5 billion of undrawn committed credit facility capacity and consistent annual FCF (post dividends) in excess of $5 billion for the past four fiscal years; --Significant reduction in core debt. HP's core leverage was 0.7x as of July 31, 2014 compared with 1.1x a year ago; --Strong worldwide market share, including leading unit market share in servers and printers and second largest share in PCs, IT services and networking; --More than 30% of HP's total revenue is recurring, primarily via printer supplies, outsourcing and technology services, and software maintenance; --Geographically diversified revenue base with majority of revenue derived from outside the U.S. Ratings concerns center on: --Sustainability of PC demand as commercial migrations attributable to Microsoft's end of support for Windows XP subsides; --Aggressive industry pricing pressure in PCs and servers that has pressured profitability, mitigated by HP's realization of cost savings from restructuring actions; --Long-term hardware revenue and profitability pressures if commercial customers aggressively adopt cloud computing in lieu of on-premise and the market for cloud services remains highly concentrated; --Event risk in terms of a major acquisition following recent media reports that HP considered merging with EMC in a purportedly all stock transaction valued at $60 billion; --Continued profitability pressures in Enterprise Group (EG), which represented approximately 36% of HP's operating income in the latest 12 months (LTM) ended July 31, 2014, down from 40% the prior year. EG operating income has decreased 8.5% in the LTM compared to the prior year. The lower margin reflects a higher mix of lower margin industry standard servers (ISS), a competitive pricing environment, and continued secular decline in high margin business critical systems (BCS) revenue, which declined 18% in the LTM ended July 31, 2014. HP's technology services revenue and operating margin are also adversely affected as customers gradually migrate to UNIX servers offered by competitors (IBM and Oracle) or x86 servers that have lower attach rates and less profitable support contracts. In addition to its solid cash position and consistent FCF, HP's liquidity is further supported by two undrawn revolving credit facilities, which had aggregate capacity of $7.5 billion as of July 31, 2014, and multiple revolving trade receivables facilities with $986 million of available capacity as of July 31, 2014. HP's revolving credit facilities consist of a $4.5 billion credit facility expiring in April 2019 and a $3 billion facility expiring in March 2017. Minimum interest coverage of 3x is the sole financial covenant. Total debt was $19.8 billion as of July 31, 2014, consisting of short-term debt of $2.7 billion, primarily current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt of $17.1 billion. Fitch estimates approximately $10.8 billion, or 55% of total debt, is attributable to HP's customer-financing business. Fitch has placed the following on Rating Watch Negative: Hewlett-Packard Company --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Senior credit facilities 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'; --Commercial paper (CP) 'F2'. Hewlett-Packard International Bank PLC --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --CP 'F2'. Electronic Data Systems LLC --Long-term IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'. Contact: Primary Analyst John M.

* Samsung Electronics to build chip plant in Pyeongtaek
* Facility could produce logic or memory chips
* Construction to be completed in second half of 2017 (Updates to include move in shares of U.S. chipmakers)
By Se Young Lee
SEOUL, Oct 6 (Reuters) - South Korean IT giant Samsung Electronics plans to spend $14.7 billion on a new chip facility - its biggest investment in a single plant - leaning on its semiconductor business to bolster profits as its smartphone dominance wanes.
Samsung, the world's top memory chip maker, said the plant would be located in Pyeongtaek, roughly 75 kilometres (47 miles) south of Seoul. The company said it would create 150,000 jobs, equal to about a third of the city's population.
The bet on chips comes as its smartphone business is being squeezed by Apple Inc in the premium segment and undercut by Chinese rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd in mid-to-low end. April-June operating profit for Samsung's mobile division fell in annual terms for the second straight quarter, the longest streak since at least 2011.
But with the higher demand for mobile devices come increased orders for mobile chips, and Samsung Electronics' semiconductor division will be key to propping up the company's bottom-line, analysts say.
The plant in Pyeongtaek will make either logic or memory chips, Samsung Electronics said, adding that a final decision had not been made yet.
"Right now the only part of the company that is bringing in steady profits is the semiconductor division, so it looks like the company will keep investing in the business," said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee.
The chip business is likely to be a lone bright spot in what is otherwise expected to be a poor third quarter for the South Korean giant. Samsung will issue its earnings guidance for the period on Tuesday.
The mean forecast from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 42 analysts calls for the firm's July-September operating profit to come in at 5.6 trillion won ($5.24 billion), its weakest performance since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Some analysts forecast that the semiconductor division will report stronger operating profit than the handset division in the third quarter for the first time in more than three years. The chip business recorded a 1.9 trillion won profit in the second quarter, compared with 4.4 trillion won for the mobile business.
The company's global smartphone market share has declined in annual terms in the last two quarters, according to Strategy Analytics, in step with the profit drop at its mobile division.
Shares of Samsung Electronics closed 0.9 percent higher on Monday, compared with a 0.4 percent decline in the broader market. In the United States, chipmakers were hit on the news of Samsung's increased efforts. The PHLX Semiconductor Index fell 1.3 percent, led by a 5.7 percent drop in Micron Technology.
GLUT CONCERNS
Samsung Electronics said its chip production capacity was expected to rise by a "low double-digit percentage." Construction of the new plant is scheduled to be completed by the second half of 2017.
Any capacity increase can be ominous for competitors in a deeply cyclical industry. Shares in domestic rival SK Hynix Inc fell more than 8 percent at one point on Monday after Samsung's announcement.
Market conditions for memory chips have remained favourable this year partly due to stronger-than-anticipated demand from personal computers and servers. Industry players like Samsung Electronics have so far been careful about capacity expansion, keeping supply conditions on a tight leash.
Besides SK Hynix Inc, competitors in the memory industry include Micron Technology Inc and Toshiba Corp.
"While the plant won't enter production until 2017, Samsung's investment plan hurts sentiment because it suggests that Samsung wants to make further market share gains," IM's Lee said.
Some analysts said investors may be over-reacting on SK Hynix shares, given how output from the new Samsung plant won't materialise for several years and it is not yet clear what chips will be made there.
They also noted that the investment will be spread out over three years, keeping spending on the project well within Samsung's typical annual semiconductor-related investments.
"This isn't about Samsung trying to destroy the industry cycle but trying to maximise profits from the semiconductor business," CIMB analyst Lee Do-hoon said.
PYEONGTAEK
The tech giant said it had brought forward its investment plan for Pyeongtaek by more than a year in response to calls from regional governments to help boost economic activity in the area.
"Samsung will continue to balance its domestic and foreign investments to ensure optimal global production structure," the company said.
Analysts said there could be practical benefits to having the new plant in relatively close proximity to other domestic chip plants as opposed to building one overseas. Some said building a new plant near Seoul makes it easier for the company to recruit local engineering talent as well.
"To some extent, this is also a response to the current government's call for big corporations to invest domestically," said Korea Investment Trust Management fund manager Baik Jae-yer.
The government has proposed a tax on excess profits at big corporations in an effort to prod them to spend more on investment, wages and dividends. (1 US dollar = 1,068.7500 Korean won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Edwina Gibbs, Ryan Woo and Gunna Dickson)

UPDATE 4-Silicon Valley giant Hewlett-Packard to split in two - WSJ

(Rewrites, adds background and data on HP)
Oct 5 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard Co , which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, plans to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday.
The move, which could be announced as early as Monday, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.
Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
HP's printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to last quarter's financial results. It is not clear how many of HP's more than 300,000 staff work in each of the planned businesses.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.
HP's market value of $66 billion is dwarfed by Apple Inc's $596 billion and Microsoft Corp's $380 billion.
It has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments. Dell, which is HP's closest U.S. competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.
SPIN-OFF TREND
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses. Last week online auction company eBay Inc said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
HP and some of its investors have long considered such a move, the Journal report noted. As one of the older big computer companies, for several years HP directors have discussed ways to restructure to keep up with technology upstarts.
A source familiar with the matter said HP had held merger talks with storage and cloud-computing firm EMC recently, as a way of moving more forcefully into online services.
Many investors and analysts have called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.
Company executives have said in the past that personal computers underpin and support the company as a whole. HP did consider spinning off its PC division in 2011 under then-CEO Leo Apotheker, but ultimately decided against the idea.
The PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines. Even so, the report of the plan to split off that business surprised some on Wall Street.
"I wonder what would have changed in the board's thinking that previously they thought they needed computers together with services to properly serve large enterprises to now," said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst.
"PCs and printing remain in long-term secular decline, and while HP has managed that business well, the challenges for that portion of the split company will only grow as the demand continues to erode, and commoditization forces prices down further."
The Journal, citing one of its sources, said the plans call for current HP CEO Meg Whitman to become CEO of the new so-called enterprise company and also be chairman of the PC and printer company.
Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo would be chairman of the enterprise company. The CEO of the PC and printer company would be Dion Weisler, who is currently an executive in that division, the report said.

A Chinese Investment on Fracking Fails to Deliver; How a Shanghai Real-Estate Mogul's Bet in Canada's Bakken Shale Went Sour
By Chester Dawson

CALGARY, Alberta¡XAbout a decade ago, a Shanghai-based real-estate mogul began amassing 100,000 acres in southeastern Saskatchewan near the North Dakota border.
Few people expected it at the time, but the surrounding Bakken Shale formation was on the cusp of revolutionizing North America's energy industry, creating oil giants of onetime small companies.
But Ni Zhaoxing's operation¡Xa rare, early foray by Chinese private equity into the North American energy sector¡Xhas little output to show for its bet, the amount of which it hasn't disclosed.
Mr. Ni in 2007 targeted production of 20,000 barrels of oil a day within Canada Capital Energy Corp.'s first five years of business. Yet the company pumped 567 barrels of oil a day last year, according to the Saskatchewan government, and has forecast production in the mid-thousands of barrels of oil and natural-gas liquids by early next year. Crescent Point Energy Corp., a rival of Canada Capital Energy produced 41,132 barrels a day last year in the Canadian Bakken.
China's fondness for North American oil and gas assets has surged recently, with Chinese companies spending $44.2 billion in the five years through 2013 on energy deals, according to Dealogic. Canada Capital Energy's anemic performance stands out as a rare misstep in a region where other companies essentially have been pumping money out of the ground through hydraulic fracturing and other relatively new techniques.
Part of the problem is that the Canadian Bakken is shallower and not as rich as the American side of the formation. It also is smaller.
Canada's share of the Bakken produces about 71,000 barrels of oil a day, compared with 1.1 million barrels a day in the U.S., according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. The Saskatchewan Research Council estimates the Canadian Bakken holds up to 100 billion barrels, but much of that can't be recovered easily or economically.
Canada Capital Energy had other problems, though. Former employees ascribe its weak results to a focus on short-term output, failure to embrace new technology and reluctance to outbid rivals for more lucrative assets. And then there was the property itself.
"The land that they had in the Bakken wasn't that good," said Graeme Bloy, who served as Canada Capital Energy's vice president for exploration from 2009 to 2012.
Canada Capital Energy Chairman Gong Jianxin, who is Mr. Ni's wife, said the company hasn't limited its ambitions to the Canadian Bakken.
The company said its net revenue has averaged 67 Canadian dollars ($60) per barrel of oil equivalent this year. That exceeds C$59 at rival Crescent Point. Crescent said its figure reflects moves into areas outside Saskatchewan, where returns aren't as strong yet.
"CCEC is one of the most profitable producers in Canada," Ms. Gong said in a written statement. "We feel happy to have made the decision to invest in Canada in 2005 and are proud to have endured the steep learning curve of establishing operations in an international jurisdiction¡Xit is the chance you take to establish a successful company."
The closely held company doesn't report earnings publicly.
In 2005 with seed money from Mr. Ni's Zhongrong Group, Canada Capital Energy began hiring a local team to buy up land leases in Saskatchewan. It was just a couple of years before the boom in crude-oil production from Bakken wells.
Ms. Gong, who is also vice chairman of Zhongrong, said Canada Capital Energy was founded on the idea that China was poised for a sharp increase in demand for natural resources and that the company hoped one day to send some output to China.
Former executives said Mr. Ni, who spoke no English but monitored the business closely from Shanghai, was impatient to see a return on investment and annoyed with the hit-or-miss nature of the oil business. Representatives for Mr. Ni deferred comment to Ms. Gong.
The Calgary-based company, which originally had its headquarters in Regina, Saskatchewan, was slow to embrace new techniques that have swept the Bakken and proved crucial to other companies success, such as fracking and horizontal drilling, former executives said.
"We didn't feel comfortable with technology that wasn't well-developed yet. In hindsight, that probably wasn't the right decision," said Mike Monea, who was Canada Capital Energy's vice president of oil and gas until 2009. He is now an executive with Saskatchewan Power Corp.
The Chinese board was composed of businesspeople with little oil-field experience and they quickly grew apprehensive about mixed drilling results and the constant need for capital to drill wells and secure new leases, former company executives said.
Bob Shirkie, Canada Capital Energy's chief geologist from 2006 to 2009, said the company was unwilling to outbid rivals for what turned out to be the best land. "They got in just before the Bakken was recognized as the next big play," he said. "But we missed out."
Funding dried up as Mr. Ni focused on other global investments, said Mr. Bloy, the former vice president for exploration. "We were undercapitalized."
Canada Capital Energy could get a second chance, again with help from China. The company this year gained commitments of about US$450 million from Chinese conglomerates Zhejiang Rongsheng Holding Group Co. and the private-equity arm of Lenovo Group Ltd.
Canada Capital Energy's head of business development, Robert Giles, said the company has shifted its focus but declined to be more specific. "From an operations standpoint, our assets do not expose us to the Bakken and we are pursuing other opportunities," he said by email.
A Canadian Energy subsidiary obtained licenses last year from Canada's National Energy Board to export natural-gas liquids such as butane and propane, but the board said the company hasn't begun shipments.
Ms. Gong said the company is evaluating various strategies, including exports of natural-gas liquids.
Gordon Houston, a Canadian transportation ministry adviser and director at the Canada Capital Energy subsidiary until 2012, said he had heard that the company might seek to export liquefied natural gas to China.
Ms. Gong said there had been "no public discussion" about the company's possible involvement in Canadian LNG facilities or in exporting natural gas.

 Lenovo  Set to Close IBM Deal, Eyes Top Spot in Server Business;  Lenovo  Expects to Close Deal for IBM's Low-End Server Business on Wednesday

Lenovo Group Ltd. is setting an ambitious goal of becoming the world's largest computer-server maker, as it expects to complete its $2.1 billion acquisition of International Business Machines Corp.'s low-end server business this week.
"We want to win more market share from competitors," Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said in an interview. "We will not be satisfied."
Lenovo, which bought IBM's personal-computer business in 2005, is already the world's largest PC maker after overtaking U.S. rivals Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. Now, Lenovo is taking on H-P and Dell in the server market, with the acquisition of IBM's x86 server unit. The deal turns Lenovo, still a relatively minor player globally, into one of the major players in the roughly $50 billion server market.
The company said Monday it had gained all the necessary approvals for its IBM server acquisition and that the deal is expected to close Wednesday.
Lenovo's expansion in the server market is also an attempt to find new engines for growth beyond the saturated PC market. While the company generates about 80% of its revenue from desktop and laptop PCs, it is trying to expand to other businesses such as servers and smartphones. Apart from the IBM server acquisition, Lenovo is in the process of completing another deal to buy the Motorola Mobility handset business from Google Inc. for $2.91 billion. The Motorola deal hasn't closed yet.
"We have a lot of work to do internally," Mr. Yang said.
As soon as it completes the acquisition, Lenovo plans to start integrating IBM's workforce. Adalio Sanchez, an IBM executive who heads the x86 server unit, will continue to lead the business after the acquisition, Lenovo said in a statement Monday.
Since Lenovo announced its plans to buy the IBM server unit in January, concerns among IBM customers about the transition have created opportunities for competitors to take market share from IBM.
Mr. Yang said that the deal's closure will help ease concerns among customers. "No matter how much share competitors have gained from IBM, we will get it back," he said.
Mr. Yang added that IBM's x86 server unit is already a profitable business, and Lenovo will try to make it more profitable.
"IBM has very good technology and very strong engineers¡K.but the industry is changing," Mr. Yang said. As IBM's current cost structure makes it difficult to compete in the fast-changing market, Lenovo will work on making the business more efficient, he said, without disclosing specific restructuring plans.
Mr. Yang said Lenovo expects higher profit margins from servers than those from PCs. In the first year after the acquisition, Lenovo expects combined revenue of $5 billion from its own server business and that formerly of IBM. Lenovo executives declined to provide the current combined revenue figure, but said $5 billion in revenue would represent substantial growth. Lenovo's 2013 revenue was $38.7 billion.
Executive Vice President Gerry Smith, who oversees Lenovo's businesses for corporate clients, said it was still too early to discuss whether Lenovo would reduce the IBM unit's workforce after the acquisition.
Messrs. Yang and Smith, in their combined interview, said the company's long-term goal is to become the No. 1 player in the server market. Mr. Smith said Lenovo aims to achieve that goal in five to seven years, following on its ascent in the PC market.
"Our competitors had better be wary because we are coming at them and coming at them hard," Mr. Smith said.
Lenovo said the IBM server deal has come in at a lower value than the previously announced $2.3 billion in part because of a change in the valuation of the IBM unit's inventories, but the deal's terms haven't changed.
In August, Lenovo said its proposed acquisition of the IBM unit passed the U.S. government panel that screens deals with possible national-security implications.

(Adds Encana, Tibco Software, Amag, Telecom Italia, EnLink Midstream, Club Mediterranee and Cevian)
Sept 29 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2005 GMT on Monday:
** Canada's Encana Corp said it will buy Athlon Energy Inc for $5.93 billion in cash, taking aim at Athlon's oil-rich lands in Texas's Permian Basin and at jump-starting its plan to boost output of lucrative oil and natural-gas liquids.
** Business software maker Tibco Software Inc agreed to be bought by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $4.3 billion, the latest software company to go private after becoming a target for activist investors.
** Amag Pharmaceuticals Inc entered the women's healthcare business by acquiring privately held Lumara Health Inc for $675 million in its biggest deal ever.
** Egyptian tycoon Naguib Sawiris would invest in Telecom Italia as long as the company kept its stake in Brazilian mobile operator TIM Participacoes, he said, as foreign bid interest picks up in the struggling operator.
** EnLink Midstream said it had signed a $235 million deal with Chevron Corp to buy natural gas pipelines in Southern Louisiana, including those linked to the Henry Hub supply point that sets U.S. futures prices.
** Italian tycoon Andrea Bonomi has written to directors of his bid target Club Mediterranee asking for updated financial information, a letter seen by Reuters shows, in a sign he still hopes to win control of the French holiday company.
** Swedish activist investor Cevian has increased its stake in German industrial services and building firm Bilfinger SE to 25.6 percent, Bilfinger said.
** U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc is likely to try to renegotiate the structure and terms of its $42.9 billion deal to buy Ireland's Covidien Plc in response to new U.S. tax rules, people familiar with the situation said on Friday.
** Lockheed Martin Corp said on Friday that it would buy a European-built military communications satellite for South Korea as part of a $7 billion deal to supply Seoul with 40 F-35 fighter jets, in what industry observers call among the most unusual "offset" agreements ever to accompany a major arms sale.
** German utility RWE AG said on Sunday that it still lacked a "comfort letter" from Britain's Department of Energy and Climate Change (DETCC), a prerequisite for closing the sale of its oil and gas unit RWE Dea AG.
** Australia's Treasury Wine Estates Ltd, one of the world's biggest wine companies, rejected takeover offers from private equity firms, saying bids that valued it at $3 billion were insufficient and required it take on too much debt.
** Japan's SoftBank Corp is in talks to acquire DreamWorks Animation SKG, the Hollywood studio behind the "Shrek" and "Madagascar" movies, a person with knowledge of the situation said. The entertainment trade publication said SoftBank had offered $32 per share for DreamWorks, a substantial premium to the stock's Friday closing price of $22.36.
** Lenovo Group Ltd will close its acquisition of International Business Machines Corp's (IBM) x86 server division on Oct. 1 for $2.1 billion, giving the Chinese tech firm the firepower to win business clients from U.S. rivals.

TEL AVIV¡XChinese investors are pouring millions into Israel-focused, tech-investment funds¡Xas well as launching their own funds and investing directly in Israeli startups¡Xamid a frenzy of tech investment and deal making here.
Yongjin Group Inc., a Chinese equity-investment management and financial- services company, has put between $15 million and $20 million into Israeli venture fund Pitango Venture Capital during the past year, according to people familiar with the matter.
Lenovo Group Ltd., the big Chinese computer maker, meanwhile invested around $10 million in Canaan Partners Israel, a venture fund affiliated with American-based Canaan Partners, in late August.
And Ping An Venture, the venture investment arm of Ping An Insurance (Group) Co., one of China's biggest financial conglomerates, in November created a $100 million fund dedicated to U.S. and Israel tech ventures. It has made six investments in Israeli startups so far, said Jiang Zhang, an associate director at Ping An Ventures.
The moves come amid a frenzy of fundraising among Israeli entrepreneurs. Israeli and foreign investors¡Xlured by a drumbeat of stock-market listings and acquisitions among Israeli tech startups¡Xhave rushed in. In the first half of 2014, 335 Israeli high-tech companies raised a record $1.6 billion in capital, according to estimates by consultancy IVC Industry Analytics and KMPG. That was 81% higher than in the year-earlier period.
While Israeli, European and American investors have long trawled Israel for tech opportunities, Chinese investors are relatively new here. Industry insiders say so far they have preferred longer-term bets and looked for technology that is already being used back home, or sought investment possibilities there.
"Most of the investments we're seeing are strategic investments and not purely financial ones," said Yoav Sade, a partner in law firm Meitar Liquornik Geva Leshem Tal and vice chairman of the Israel-China Chamber of Commerce.
"Chinese investors would look for tech companies that already have a product and sales with an added value that has to do with China," said Mr. Sade. "Many times the investment contracts include commercialization licenses for operations in China."
In July, Chinese venture fund SAIF Partners participated in a $15 million funding round in app-monetization company SupersonicAds Ltd. It was SAIF's first investment in an Israeli company, according to Ben Ng, a partner at SAIF Partners, who joined Supersonic's board following the investment.
At the same time, Supersonic announced plans to expand its business in China, Japan and India, saying it intended to open offices in Beijing, Tokyo and Bangalore.
"For the last two years, SAIF has been looking to expand its portfolio with a cross-border view. We're looking at companies in Israel" and Silicon Valley, said Mr. Ng.
Ping An and Chinese venture investor China Broadband Capital Partners LP took part in a $85-million, pre-initial public offering funding round in adware company IronSource Ltd. IronSource launched its Chinese branch with offices in Beijing this week.
Despite these direct investments, much of the early money is being funneled through Israeli funds. Chinese Internet-security company Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. and web search giant Baidu Inc. have both invested in Carmel Ventures, an Israel venture fund, according to people familiar with the matter, with Qihoo putting in about $10 million in early 2014. Qihoo has also invested money with Jerusalem Venture Partners, according to people familiar with the matter.

Chinese Overseas Buying Increasingly Shifts to Private From State; China's Private Sector Is Narrowing the Gap With State Firms on Overseas Acquisitions

China has been Asia's top buyer of overseas assets for years, but inside the country, the pendulum of buyers is shifting. Instead of state firms armed with billions of dollars pursuing assets from oil to mining, China's buyers are increasingly companies led by homegrown entrepreneurs on the lookout for Western brands and technology.
One-off acquisitions by China's big state companies remain bigger, but in the last three years, privately owned firms like computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. and Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. have contributed to the ever-larger volumes of buying abroad. Even Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the Chinese ecommerce giant that just raised US$21.8 billion in a New York initial public offering, has built up stakes in overseas assets, including U.S. mobile messaging service TangoMe Inc. this year.
"The theme of outbound China M&A has changed. State-owned enterprises are no longer the only buyers going overseas, private companies in industries like consumer and technology have started doing high-profile acquisitions on the global stage in recent years," said Stephen Gore, Asian-Pacific head of mergers and acquisitions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
At no time in the past has the gap between private and state buying of overseas assets been so small: This year alone, 188 overseas purchases worth $21 billion have been undertaken by non-state-owned Chinese firms, just $2 billion less than their bigger government counterparts, according to Dealogic data. Four years ago, state purchases, such as the $7.1 billion acquisition of Repsol Brasil SA by China Petrochemical Corp., contributed to a $24 billion gap.
By last year, overseas buying by private companies had reached a record high of $23 billion, almost three times the level in 2010. As single deals, state acquisitions remain bigger, but private firms have been busier. This year's top Chinese outbound deal was the $7 billion acquisition of Peruvian copper mine Las Bambas, followed by Lenovo's $2.9 billion bid for Google Inc.'s Motorola business and its $2.3 billion offer for International Business Machines Corp.'s low-end server operation. Those transactions are expected to close by the end of the year.
Bankers point to three reasons behind the rising comparative heft of private companies: falling resource prices, the small size of their deals, and even Beijing's anti-corruption drive, which has put the focus on overspending by state firms.
"Large SOEs securing natural resources overseas have accounted for a major part of China's outbound acquisitions, but that's been slowing down because of the commodity backdrop and weak prices," said Lian Lian, North Asia co-head of M&A at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. For instance, oil prices have fallen 9% since the US$15.1 billion acquisition by Cnooc Ltd. of Canadian oil explorer Nexen Inc., still the biggest Chinese acquisition overseas.
"Another reason for the slowdown of state buying is that there's been tighter scrutiny of acquisitions under this new [leadership regime] and people have become more cautious," Ms. Lian said.
Bankers say the many foreign purchases by private firms are often also too small to attract regulatory scrutiny. Under new rules, only overseas purchases worth over $1 billion need a full review by the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, though acquisitions in "sensitive" industries like news media and telecommunications will still have to be vetted.
Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Hong Kong-based boutique bank Reorient Group Ltd., said he expects Chinese private companies to continue their overseas purchases, with the West as their main target.
"The U.S. market has a big pool of available assets for sale, and Europe has a lot of distressed assets, which are attractive from a price perspective," Mr. McGonegal said.
Earlier this year, Reorient advised House of Fraser Ltd., a U.K. operator of luxury departments stores, on its ?480 million ($786 million) sale to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower Group Ltd. The deal was the largest investment by a Chinese company in the retail sector overseas. The 165-year-old British department-store chain posted a loss before tax and exceptional items of ?6.9 million for the year to January 26, 2013, its last publicly disclosed financial statements.

Fitch: Sony's USD1.7bn Write-Down Highlights Weakness in Mobiles

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, September 17 (Fitch) Sony's (BB-/Negative) JPY180bn (USD1.65bn) write-down in its mobile communications business comes as no surprise, and is not likely to affect the credit rating, says Fitch Ratings. Our assumptions about Sony's mobile business profitability and cash generation have been consistently lower than those of management, given the competitive nature of the smartphone market and Sony's struggle to achieve the scale required for this business to be a success. Sony's revisions to its forecast cash flow indicate that it now believes that the mobile communication segment's valuation does not support goodwill which has a carrying value of JPY180m. As a result, the company has reviewed its smartphone strategy, and will now target more niche consumer segments.
 We think the revised strategy to focus on premium mobile products in certain markets is more sound than trying to compete strongly in the mid-range smartphone market. However, lack of scale means that it will struggle against the big two, Apple and Samsung (A+/Stable), and will also face competition in the premium market from LG Electronics (BBB-/Stable), HTC and Nokia. In addition, the premium market is under threat from lower-cost Chinese manufacturers such as Lenovo, Huawei and Xiaomi, whose product design, build quality and functionality is improving to a level which may threaten the premium market in the longer term. These businesses will have to invest significantly in their brands before they represent a significant challenge to the big two in the premium market. Nevertheless, their growing strength in the low- and mid-market is leading to a narrowing in margins for all competitors. According to International Data Corporation, Sony's share of the smartphone market declined to 3.1% in the year to June 2014 (June 2013: 4.0%). In contrast Huawei's share rose to 6.7% from 4.3%, Lenovo to 5.2% from 4.7%, and Xiaomi to 4.6% from 1.7%. The write-down supports our long-held view that mobile phones are unlikely to be a key element in Sony's recovery, and our rating assumes continued weak performance in this segment. However, credit markets were surprised by the announcement, with five-year CDS prices spiking up to 142bp from 112bp, according to Bloomberg, despite the positive news for creditors that the company will not be paying a dividend this year. Management's resolve to make difficult decisions will be tested if performance in the mobile business does not improve. Apart from PCs, the company continues to produce the same products as five years ago, and we believe that more aggressive reform to revamp Sony's product and business portfolio is overdue. For example, the company appears committed to turning around its TV business following 10 straight years of losses. We rate Sony's chance of meeting its break-even target for TVs in the year ending March 2015 (FYE15) at no greater than 50%.

Google Unveils $105 Smartphone for Emerging Markets; New Phones Will be First to Use Google's Android One Platform

NEW DELHI¡XGoogle Inc. on Monday unveiled a new line of low-cost smartphones, hoping to persuade more people in India and other emerging markets to upgrade their handsets, and to gain more control over its Android mobile-operating system.
The new phones will cost around $105 and will be the first to use Google's Android One platform, which was designed to give users in developing economies a reliable and affordable way to get online.
"The pace at which users are adopting the Internet is unprecedented," Sundar Pichai, senior vice president at Google who oversees Android, told reporters in India's capital. "Almost all of this growth that is happening in India and the world is due to mobile [phones]."
More than one billion people already use phones that run Google's Android operating system. The new Google platform is an attempt by the company to extend its leading position as it seeks to reach billions more people in emerging markets that historically haven't been able to afford smartphones. Only about 10% of India's more than 900 million cellphone users have smartphones.
Android is the world's dominant smartphone operating system, accounting for 85% of world-wide shipments in the second quarter, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.
But the Android ecosystem can be messy, because the phones are sold by many hardware makers, and users are inconsistent about updating the software. Nearly a year after Google released KitKat, the latest version of the operating system, it is being used on only about one-fourth of Android devices.
With Android One devices, Google will be able to update software remotely, without the help of the handset makers. In theory this should help the company improve the user experience and fix glitches quicker.
Google also is likely trying to protect its brand by having more control over handsets that use its operating system, analysts say. App developers will benefit if more users update the software to the latest version of the operating system.
"For Google, a strong uptake of Android One smartphones should increase the access to the Internet and Google's suite of products," said Bhasker Canagaradjou, associate director at Ipsos SA's business consulting in India.
Google plans to bring Android One smartphones to Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan and other South Asian nations by the end of 2014, and more countries next year.
In India, the Android One smartphones will be made and distributed by Micromax Informatics Ltd., P.S. Associates Private Ltd.'s Karbonn and Spice Retail Ltd. Data plans for the phones will be offered from Bharti Airtel Ltd., the country's largest telecommunications company by subscribers.
The Internet search giant plans to add other handset makers, including Japan's Panasonic Corp., China's Lenovo Group Ltd., and Taiwan's HTC Corp.
Other smartphones are available in India for about $105. But Google is hoping the Android One platform¡Xwhich includes software and hardware designed by Google¡Xwill help it deliver a more consistent performance than some of the low-cost, Android-powered phones that are already being sold.
Last month, Mozilla Corp. started selling its own line of low-cost smartphones through Indian manufacturers for less than $40. The Mozilla devices use a new Firefox operating system for phones.
India is the second-biggest overall telecom market, but is the fourth-largest market for smartphones. The South Asian country offers great growth potential, analysts said.
The new handsets unveiled Monday will allow users to use social networking and messaging services in Hindi. Google plans to add six other Indian languages to Android One phones.
The new smartphones will likely trigger some sort of reaction on pricing and product mix from Indian and Chinese low-cost handset makers as well as global giants such as Samsung Electronics Co., which all already have smartphones at around $100, analysts said.
"The [new] Google Android phone will directly compete with Samsung," said Ipsos's Mr. Canagaradjou.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co is exploring the sale of its web-based photo sharing service Snapfish, and has held discussions with multiple private equity and industry buyers, a person with knowledge of the situation said.
Snapfish, which HP bought for more than $300 million in 2005 and currently sits within its printing and personal systems group, is considered non-core for the company, the person said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.
A spokesman for HP declined to comment.
Last year, HP replaced the printing and personal business' long-time head Todd Bradley with former Lenovoexecutive Dion Weisler. Bradley has since left the technology company, to join Tibco Software Inc as its president.
Some of the parties that have been eyeing Snapfish have also expressed interest in buying another online photo-sharing services provider, Shutterfly Inc, the person said.
Shutterfly hired Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Partners over the summer to find a buyer, and is expected wrap up its process in the next several weeks, people familiar with the matter have said previously.

HONG KONG, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index ended lower for a fifth straight day on Thursday, failing to hold onto slim midday gains after China indexes slid into the red with investors turning cautious ahead of more economic data.
Also weighing on Asian market sentiment was U.S. President Barack Obama's speech vowing to fight Islamic State militants, which increased risk aversion.
The Hang Seng Index was off 0.2 percent at 24,662.64 points, a one-month closing low. The China Enterprises Index of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong lost 0.8 percent.
Top percentage loser on the Hang Seng was Lenovo Group , which sank 4.2 percent after its chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing cut holdings in the company.
Profit-taking continued to hurt major energy names. PetroChina shed 1.6 percent, CNOOC 1.2 percent, and Sinopec Corp 1.4 percent. (Reporting by Grace Li; Editing by Richard Borsuk)

Delayed iPhone Release Highlights Apple's Challenges in China; Decision to Hold Off on World's Largest Smartphone Market Marks Departure From Previous Launch

China is one of Apple Inc.'s biggest markets by sales and a major growth driver. But when it comes to its new iPhones, the country will have to wait, highlighting the difficulties the technology giant faces in getting its China strategy right.
The Cupertino, Calif., company on Tuesday unveiled its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which have larger screens than previous models. But while Apple said its new smartphones would go on sale Sept. 19 in the U.S. and some European and Asian markets, including Hong Kong, it didn't list China as one of countries where they would be immediately available.
It's a change from when Apple launched the iPhone 5S last year and the device was available through major carriers in China at the same time as the U.S.
Apple's Beijing-based spokeswoman declined to comment on the reason for the delay. She said the company sees China as a key market and is trying to get the new iPhones there as soon as possible.
China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which approves among many things the import of mobile devices into the country, didn't list the new smartphones among devices approved for sale as of Wednesday. Officials didn't respond to a request for comment.
A moderate delay won't likely cause lasting damage to Apple's sales in China because of the brand's cachet and because the bigger screens are attractive to Chinese consumers, analysts say. Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, generated $5.94 billion in revenue for Apple during the fiscal third quarter ended June 28, up 28% from a year earlier and making up nearly 16% of its total revenue. That compares with $14.58 billion in the U.S. and $8.09 billion in Europe.
"Apple may face limited supplies initially and could want time to build up the phone's new electronic wallet function there," said Sandy Shen, an analyst at Gartner.
Other analysts speculated that the delay could be due to a recent cut in handset subsidies from Chinese mobile carriers, potentially weakening demand.
Apple has faced increasing competition from rival Samsung Electronics Co., which was faster to offer the larger screens that many Chinese consumers like for streaming TV shows and playing games. It is also facing growing competition from local manufacturers such as Xiaomi Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd., which are offering phones with increasingly competitive hardware at budget prices.
Apple also is under growing scrutiny from labor conditions among its suppliers, and faced criticism in government-run media for its warranty practices and for its location tracking feature, with the official China Central Television labeling it a security threat. Apple has said it closely monitors labor conditions among suppliers and apologized for its warranty practices. It also says it doesn't track iPhone users.
Still, the U.S. company has increased its market share in the world's largest smartphone market after broadening sales channels. In December, it unveiled a deal to offer phones through China Mobile Ltd., the world's largest mobile carrier. Its share of the Chinese smartphone market rose to 6.5% in the second quarter from 4.9% the year before, according to IDC, making it the country's No. 6 smartphone maker.
"The country's impact on the global smartphone market has continued to increase given its large population, and its shipment growth is still relatively fast compared to the mature markets in the West," said Kitty Fok, a Beijing-based analyst at IDC.
Apple has been criticized in the past by customers for being slow to launch products in China, a phenomenon that has led to a flourishing gray market in iPhones bought elsewhere, typically in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong retailers said they expected the delay would reignite gray-market demand.
"We have seen keen interest in the iPhone 6 among Chinese customers," said Lo Lau, who operates a smartphone store in Hong Kong's bustling Mongkok neighborhood. Mr. Lau said he expected sales of gray-market iPhones to jump between 20% and 30% as a result of the delayed mainland launch.
Apple's new products were the most-discussed topic on Chinese social-media service Sina Weibo on Wednesday. "The iPhone 6 Plus will kill all the big-screen Android devices to become the new must-have for rich people," wrote Wang Guanxiong, a well-known tech marketing expert.
Still, for many users, the most noteworthy element of the release was the translation of "Bigger than Bigger," Apple's slogan for the new phones, on the company's mainland China website. Many said it sounded awkward in Chinese. "Can't Apple afford to hire someone with a basic education to handle the translation?" asked one Weibo user.
Some posted their own slogans in response, among them "Really Damn Big," "Just Big," and "If You Say It's Not Big, You're Not Being Objective." One user, taking a dig at Apple for following Samsung in offering bigger screens, suggested "More Samsung Than Samsung."
There are no prices listed on Apple's mainland China website yet, but the company's Hong Kong website lists the 16-gigabyte iPhone 6 at 5,588 Hong Kong dollars ($721) and the 16GB iPhone 6 Plus at HK$6,388. That's more expensive than the comparable Samsung Galaxy S5, which typically sells for less than 4,000 yuan ($652) in China, and the Mi 4, produced by China's Xiaomi, which goes for about 2,000 yuan.
"Here are three reasons I won't be buying the iPhone 6," read one popular post on Weibo, with a photo attached that repeated the Chinese character for "poor" three times.
The Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the responses.
