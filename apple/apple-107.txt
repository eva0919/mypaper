Competition may be catching up to Pandora Media. And that isn't its biggest hurdle.
The Internet music service's third-quarter results slightly beat estimates. It also raised guidance. But user-growth issues and worries about rising content costs drowned out those positive notes.
Pandora only added a net 100,000 active users over the previous quarter. That compares with sequential step-ups of 1.6 million and 3.8 million in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Pandora has added only a net 300,000 users in 2014's first nine months.
The company said "an increasingly competitive environment" would make driving monthly user growth more difficult. Yet analysts forecast net user additions of around nine million in 2015. That will require higher marketing expenses and may not be enough amid competition from the likes of Apple's iTunes Radio.
Pandora maintains it can eventually reach 100 million monthly active users, up from 76.5 million at the end of the third quarter, with help from trends like more car installations. It said listening hours, which rose 25% year over year in the quarter, are a more important measure of engagement. But there is a limit to how much those can rise without user growth.
And content costs, about 50% of revenue, are a big unknown. The government board that dictates royalties paid by Internet radio providers won't conclude its rate-setting process until December 2015. Pandora wants a sizable decrease in its per-song rate, while SoundExchange, representing artists, wants a big increase. Meeting in the middle would mean a 35% rise in 2016 content costs, says SIG Susquehanna Financial Group.
Even if Pandora's rates do end up falling, that much uncertainty tends to hurt investors' ears.
