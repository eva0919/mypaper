Pandora Media Inc. reported a 25% increase in the number of hours listeners tuned in during the third quarter, the first year-to-year comparison since the Internet radio giant ended its 40-hour free-listening monthly cap.
Advertising revenue, radio・s bread and butter, rose 44% to $194.3 million, with local advertising more than doubling to $41.8 million from the year-earlier period.
While revenue has been growing strongly, Pandora, which went public in 2011, has struggled to post a profit as listener growth brought along higher royalty fees to music labels and the company faces stiff competition in a crowded field that includes Spotify Ltd., Sirius XM Radio Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.
Pandora has boosted its sales force by about 70 over the past 12 months and on Wednesday launched an analytics tool, AMP, that allows the roughly 125,000 musicians on Pandora to access listener data, such as age and gender, and map where fans are.
On Thursday, Pandora again raised its earnings projection for the year to 19 cents to 21 cents a share on revenue of $912 million to $917 million, from its previous estimate of 16 cents to 19 cents a share on revenue of $895 million to $915 million.
For the current quarter, the company expects a profit of 17 cents to 19 cents a share on revenue of $273 million to $278 million, compared to the Wall Street consensus of 17 cents a share on revenue of $272.8 million.
Overall, the Oakland, Calif., company reported a loss of $2 million, or a penny a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.1 million, or two cents a share. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, Pandora reported a profit of nine cents a share, up from five cents a year earlier.
Revenue rose nearly 42% to $239.6 million.
In July, the company had projected earnings of five cents to eight cents a share for the quarter on revenue of $235 million to $240 million.
Total operating expenses rose 48%.
At quarter・s end, Pandora・s active listeners reached 76.5 million, up 5.2% from a year earlier, while its share of U.S. radio listening in September reached 9.06%, up from 7.77% a year earlier.
Shares, which peaked at $40.44 in March, fell nearly 2% in recent after-hours trading. The company・s stock is down 13% for the year.
