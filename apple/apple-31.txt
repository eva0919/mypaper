(The following statement was released by the rating agency) SAN FRANCISCO, October 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its 'AAA' rating on the following certificates of participation (COPS) of the Santa Clara Valley Water District, CA (the district): --$9.3 million series 2004A; --$62.7 million series 2007A; --$43 million series 2012A. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The COPs are payable from installment payments made in connection with the 1994 Installment Agreement (for the series 2003A and 2012A COPs) and 1995 Installment Agreement (2007A COPs). The installment payments are secured by a first lien on gross revenues of the district's flood control system, which include voter-approved benefit assessments. KEY RATING DRIVERS STRONG BASE PROVIDES ASSESSMENTS: The fixed benefit assessments are levied on all parcels in Santa Clara County's (the county) very large, wealthy, and diverse tax base.
 GUARANTEED COLLECTIONS OFFSET COVERAGE: The county guarantee of 100% of the benefit assessments levied minimizes variability in pledged revenue, offsetting the 1.25x maximum annual debt service (MADS) limit to the benefit assessment. LIMITED OPERATING RISK: The flood control operations have limited operational risk. RATING SENSITIVITIES SHIFTS IN ASSESSMENT PAYERS: The rating is sensitive to a significant decline in the number or economic profile of parcels in the district. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that such a change is highly unlikely. CREDIT PROFILE STRONG STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS The district is a multi-purpose special district, coterminous with the county and charged with providing flood protection services and water to county residents. The COPs are secured by gross revenues of the flood control system. In 1986 and 1990, voters authorized the district to levy benefit assessments on all district parcels based on the benefit received by each parcel from flood control services while simultaneously limiting the total benefit assessments levied to 1.25x MADS on certificates outstanding prior to June 30, 1995, or refundings of those COPs. Fiscal 2015 assessments on residential properties range from $15 to $44 per parcel in the district's five flood zones. The district covenants to annually reset the benefit assessments levied to provide debt service coverage (DSC) of 1.25x MADS. The assessment is levied on property on parity with all other property taxes and collection is guaranteed by the county, which participates in the Teeter program. The property tax base is diverse, with the top 10 largest benefit assessment payers accounting for about 6.7% of the total. FAVORABLE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; SOUND COVERAGE Financial results within flood control operations (which are included in the district's governmental activities) are strong, characterized by high fund balance levels. Though COPs are primarily secured by the assessment levies, they are ultimately secured by a gross revenue pledge on virtually all flood control system revenues. Aside from the benefit assessments, the primary source of flood control system revenue is the district's portion of the county 1% property levy that it allocates to flood protection. The district allocated $55.6 million of the 1% property tax (or about 50%) to the flood control system in fiscal 2013, resulting in DSC of about 4.95x, according to the district's fiscal 2013 continuing disclosure annual report. However, this tax allocation is at the discretion of the board; in any year the board could elect to allocate no portion of the 1% property tax to flood control. Fitch believes that this is unlikely; nonetheless, the 'AAA' rating relies solely on the security provided by the benefit assessment. BROAD AND EXPANDING TAX AND ASSESSMENT BASE The district and county encompass 1,330 square miles, 1.8 million residents, and more than 400,000 parcels. Fitch expects the number of parcels to remain fairly stable The county economy is strong and diverse. The county's assessed valuation (AV) increased by 2.8% on average annually from fiscal 2008-2014 despite a 2.3% decline in fiscal 2011, reflecting the impact of the housing correction. AV has since recovered with gains of 0.9% and 3.2% in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, respectively. Fiscal 2014 AV jumped 8.4% and fiscal 2015 AV is reportedly up another 6.8%, reflecting the county's currently very strong economic growth. Wealth levels are well above average (per capita income is 139% of the state level). The economy has above-average exposure to the cyclical high-technology sector, but also benefits from a significant amount of venture capital invested in local companies. Large private employers include Google, Cisco, Apple, Stanford University, Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, Kaiser, Applied Materials, Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Intel Corporation.
