    By Jongwoo Cheon
    SINGAPORE, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Most emerging Asian currencies
edged up on Wednesday as regional stocks advanced and sentiment
improved, with the European Central Bank seen readying to launch
its plan to buy corporate bonds.
    South Korea's won gained on demand from exporters
for month-end settlements and as some offshore funds bought the
currency.
    Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose
nearly 1 percent, tracking higher U.S. stocks after
stronger-than-expected earnings from Apple Inc and
Texas Instruments Inc.
    Risk appetite improved as the ECB is considering buying
corporate bonds on the secondary market and may decide on the
matter as soon as December, several sources told Reuters.
 
    Emerging Asian currencies, however, failed to fully benefit
from strong equity performances and the ECB's stimulus plan as
the dollar broadly rose against a basket of major
currencies.
    "Any rebound in Asian currencies is unlikely to last long,"
said Jeong My-young, Samsung Futures' research head in Seoul.
    "Given differentials in economic fundamentals and interest
rates, the dollar's strong trend will sustain."
    
    RUPIAH
    The rupiah eased on dollar demand from importers for
month-end payments.
    Traders booked profits from gains in the currency, which on
Tuesday hit its strongest in about four weeks.
    The official Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR),
which the central bank launched last year in an effort to manage
exchange rate fluctuations, was fixed at 12,026 rupiah per
dollar, weaker than Tuesday's 11,993.
