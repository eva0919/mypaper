NEW DELHI--Microsoft Corp.'s cellphone unit on Monday launched a new midtier smartphone in India in an effort to recoup eroding market share in a critical developing market.
The phone, dubbed the Nokia Lumia 630, is aimed at a niche in between the premium models sold by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. and lower-end phones made by the likes of China's Xiaomi and India's Micromax Informatics Ltd.
When Microsoft took over Nokia Corp.'s handset business last month, it inherited the Finnish company's weakened competitive position in India, the world's second-largest telecommunications market, after China.
P. Balaji managing director of Nokia India Sales Pvt. Ltd, a unit of Microsoft's Microsoft Mobiles Oy, said the Lumia 630 will be priced at just under $200 in the Indian market and will accommodate two SIM cards.
The sub-$200 price category "is the largest growth area for smartphones," said Mark C. Newman, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. In addition, he said, "dual-Sim phones are becoming more common in emerging markets."
Indian consumers have in recent years begun to favor dual-Sim phones so they can take advantage of different network operators' pricing deals and toggle between personal and business numbers on a single handset.
The new phone has a 4.5-inch screen and runs on Microsoft Corp's latest Windows 8.1 software. It will be available in retail stores from Friday, the company said.
