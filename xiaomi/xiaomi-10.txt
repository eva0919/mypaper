China is one of Apple Inc.'s biggest markets by sales and a major driver of its revenue growth. But when it comes to its new iPhones, the country will have to wait, highlighting the difficulties the technology giant faces in getting its China strategy right.
While Apple this week said its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus would go on sale beginning Sept. 19 in the U.S. and some European and Asian markets, including Hong Kong, it didn't list China as one of countries where they would be immediately available.
It's a change from when Apple launched the iPhone 5S last year and the device was available in China at the same time as it arrived in U.S. stores.
Apple's Beijing-based spokeswoman declined to comment on the reason for the delay this time. She said the company sees China as a key market and is trying to get the new iPhones there as soon as possible.
In China, Apple has faced increasing competition from rival Samsung Electronics Co. and local manufacturers such as Xiaomi Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd.
