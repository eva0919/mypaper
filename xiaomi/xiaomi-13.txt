<title:>Rise of Chinese Phones Breaks Samsung's Grip

SEOUL -- The rapid deterioration of Samsung Electronics Co.'s mobile-phone business raises the question: Will Chinese companies soon rule the smartphone market?
The world's biggest smartphone maker by sales said Thursday that its third-quarter profit dropped 49% as less-expensive handsets, chiefly from China, ate away at its business. A trio of market-tracking firms confirmed that the South Korean technology company is losing ground even faster than many analysts had predicted.
Although Chinese handset makers have been pushing into smartphones for several years, the pace of their rise -- and Samsung's decline -- over the last half-year has been stunning.
Since the beginning of this year, global smartphone shipments have ballooned for Chinese smartphone makers including Xiaomi Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. Handsets from Chinese companies now account for 38% of the global market, more than Samsung and Apple Inc. combined, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Xiaomi jumped to third place in the global market, behind Samsung and Apple, with 5.6% in the third quarter. It had 3.9% in the first quarter.
Samsung's smartphone market share tumbled to 25% in the third quarter from 31% in the first, Strategy Analytics said. The tech company's mobile-phone profit margin dropped to 7% from 20%. Samsung blamed that decline in part on increased marketing costs to clear a glut of unsold smartphones that piled up in China and elsewhere.
Apple's iPhone had 12% of the market in the third quarter, down from 15% in the first.
Samsung isn't the only South Korean company struggling as low-cost Chinese rivals catch up. The Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade forecast recently that Chinese manufacturers will likely catch up with or surpass their Korean rivals within five years in areas including ships, petrochemicals, steel and textiles. In mid- to low-price smartphones, the government research group predicted that China would outstrip Korea within two years.
To be sure, gaining market share doesn't guarantee profit growth and can erode earnings for everyone. It isn't clear how much of a profit closely held Xiaomi or Huawei make on smartphones, if any.
But Samsung says it is determined to fight back. Samsung executives said Thursday that they would seek to compete more directly with rivals in mid- and low-price phones, where Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo sell smartphones for about $300. An equivalent model from Samsung can cost twice as much.
Kim Hyun-joon, a senior vice president in Samsung's mobile-communications business, said the company would tweak the design and user interface of its lower-end devices to set itself apart from its rivals.
Samsung also will seek to produce devices more economically. "The key is efficiency, to increase the number of components shared across mid- to low-end models, so that we can further leverage economies of scale," Mr. Kim said.
Samsung also is expected to shuffle executives, as the company typically does toward year-end, in its mobile division.
"Helped in part by management changes, we expect Samsung to work aggressively to retake business lost to Xiaomi and others in China," Jefferies analyst Sundeep Bajikar wrote in a note to clients.
Following poor earnings earlier this year, hundreds of senior managers in Samsung's mobile division took a 25% cut in their first-half bonuses, people familiar with the matter said. Executives and senior managers are bracing for more cost cuts, a person familiar with the situation said recently.
Even with Samsung's new strategy for dealing with its low-cost rivals, the company suggested the best days for its smartphone business may be behind it. Samsung's third-quarter profit margin of 7% for its mobile business was the lowest since the beginning of 2009. It followed 10 straight quarters in which the division's margin exceeded 15%. Mr. Kim said the mobile division's new goal is simply to maintain a double-digit margin.
Samsung still is going strong in semiconductors, a steady source of profit since before its smartphone successes of the past several years. The chip and components business contributed 57% of the company's third-quarter profit -- a contrast to just six months ago, when the mobile division represented 76% of Samsung's earnings.
Samsung's memory-chip business is riding strong demand, and the company is hoping that sales of processors will accelerate with the opening of a high-tech factory to start mass production by year-end.
