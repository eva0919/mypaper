Samsung Electronics Co. on Thursday said its quarterly net profit nearly halved, as its mobile business continued to lose ground to low-cost Chinese smartphone makers¡Xa rivalry that is expected to intensify.
Samsung also warned that uncertainty remains for its mobile business in the current quarter, since it will have to ramp up marketing efforts to counter an anticipated year-end surge in competitors¡¦ smartphone launches.
Separately, data from three market-share trackers released Thursday showed Samsung¡¦s share of global smartphone sales fell sharply during the three months ended September. Although still ranked No. 1, Samsung had around a quarter of the smartphone market by sales, versus roughly a third just a year ago, according to International Data Corp., Counterpoint Research and Strategy Analytics.
Samsung said its net profit during the quarter ended in September fell 49% versus a year earlier, to 4.2 trillion won ($4 billion). That followed a 20% profit decline in the previous quarter.
The quarterly earnings drop was the result of a 74% year-over-year decline in profit from Samsung¡¦s mobile division, to 1.75 trillion won, the lowest since the second quarter of 2011. Weaker smartphone sales and lower prices ground Samsung¡¦s mobile margins down to 7%, the thinnest since the company began offering smartphones.
Samsung¡¦s semiconductor business replaced mobile as the company¡¦s largest profit driver for the first time in three years, accounting for 56% of total operating profit and logging a margin of 23%, up from 21% a year.earlier. Mobile-division profit accounted for 43% of Samsung¡¦s operating profit; as recently as the beginning of the year, the division had accounted for roughly three-quarters of total profit.
¡§We will focus on obtaining a sustainable double-digit percentage margin¡¨ in mobile phones, Kim Hyun-joon, a senior vice president at Samsung¡¦s mobile unit said during a conference call following the earnings release.
Company executives said they would try harder to differentiate Samsung¡¦s handsets from those of competitors next year by adopting more flexible displays and metal frames. But analysts expect the introduction of next-generation devices like foldable-screen phones in sizable volumes to be difficult due to technological hurdles.
Regaining a foothold against low-cost brands will remain a challenge amid heightened price competition, analysts say, leaving the company with a bleak outlook for its mobile unit.
Upstart Chinese phone-maker Xiaomi Inc. recently overtook Samsung in China as the largest smartphone vendor in the country, and figures released Thursday showed it jumped to the No. 3 spot globally¡Xlargely driven by its strong China performance.
In the latest sign of how important the China market is to Samsung, the Samsung Group Wednesday released a rare statement from Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee, the son of ailing Chairman Lee Kun-hee who is seen as the conglomerate¡¦s next leader, on a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
¡§Samsung will actively expand its business in China in accordance with the government¡¦s policies and hope to be a loved company within China that makes contributions to its society,¡¨ Mr. Lee told Chinese leaders, according to the statement.
China isn't only an important smartphone market for Samsung¡Xit also is expected to play an increasingly large role for the company¡¦s chip business. In 2012, Samsung unveiled plans to invest $7 billion for a new chip plant in China over the course of several years. Following an initial investment of $2.3 billion, the company began producing memory chips in 2013 from the plant in Xi¡¦an city.
Samsung¡¦s total operating profit during the quarter ended in September slid 60% from a year earlier to 4.1 trillion won on a 20% fall in revenue to 47.4 trillion won for the quarter, in line with market expectations.
Samsung shipped 79.2 million smartphones during the quarter ended Sept. 30, a drop from the 88.4 million units shipped during the same period a year earlier, according to Strategy Analytics.
The company didn¡¦t disclose exact shipment figures for its mobile phones.
