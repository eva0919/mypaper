HONG KONG -- Sharp Corp. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. have scrapped plans to jointly develop and sell smartphones under the Sharp brand in China, in part because of intensifying competition from local phone makers, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
Taiwan's Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn, is Apple Inc.'s main contract manufacturer that assembles iPhones and iPads, while Japan's Sharp, a supplier of liquid-crystal-display panels used in mobile devices, counts Apple as one of its clients.
The smartphone tie-up in China was supposed to be part of a broader alliance between Sharp and Hon Hai, which began in March 2012 when Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou agreed to invest in Sharp's most advanced Japanese LCD panel factory. At the time, Hon Hai had planned to buy a 10% stake in Sharp, but their talks later stalled, and Hon Hai never bought that stake.
The companies decided to drop their China smartphone plans after assessing the opportunities and risks in the Chinese market, where competition from local manufacturers has intensified over the past year, one of the people said.
Still, the decision to scrap the smartphone partnership in China won't affect other existing alliances between Sharp and Hon Hai, such as the Japanese LCD factory in which Mr. Gou has already invested, according to the person.
Another person familiar with Hon Hai's business said the Taiwanese contract manufacturer's smartphone business has already shifted its focus away from Sharp to work more closely with Chinese phone brands such as Xiaomi Inc.
China's smartphone market is the world's largest after it overtook the U.S. last year. It is crowded with major foreign brands such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple as well as powerful homegrown players such as Lenovo Group Ltd.
