HONG KONG -- The Japanese electronics giant Sony said on Wednesday that it expected to post a loss of more than $2 billion for the fiscal year, almost five times what it previously forecast, exposing signs of serious wear in its mobile unit.
Sony said the loss of 230 billion yen, or $2.14 billion, for the fiscal year that ends in March -- compared with an earlier projection of ?50 billion -- was deeper than it had expected because of reduced growth in its once-thriving mobile segment. The additional losses come from a quarterly write-down on the unit's value of about ?180 billion. Sony also said it would not pay a dividend for the year.
In a news release, Sony said it would focus more on its phones on the higher end and cut the number of phones in its midrange lineup. It also said it would change the strategy for the division. Kazuo Hirai, Sony's president and chief executive, said at a news conference Wednesday that the company would cut the division's work force by 15 percent, or about 1,000 workers.
''We had to make changes of our midterm management, plan given big changes and severe competition in the market,'' he said. ''We had to make changes in our strategy. We will concentrate our management resources on countries and regions where we can expect high profit, and will review our strategy if we see low profit and growth in certain regions or countries.''
Last year, Sony's mobile phone division was its most profitable, but sales have fallen as competition from Asian rivals in midrange smartphones has intensified. For instance, in China, the world's largest smartphone market, companies like Huawei and Xiaomi have become dominant.
At the higher end, Apple and Samsung are tough rivals. Analysts said that Sony's new Xperia Z3 smartphone could struggle because its release coincided with the announcement of the Apple iPhone 6.
''Changes are so dramatic in this market, in terms of product and price and services,'' Mr. Hirai said of the total mobile market. ''We have to watch the situation carefully and try to shape the organization so that we can react to these changes.''
Still, others have been positive about Sony's handset unit, saying that a more modest plan aimed at the company's strongest markets, like Japan, could succeed.
''This seems to be the end game for Sony as a major player in consumer electronics,'' said Pelham Smithers, managing director of Pelham Smithers Associates in London. ''It's a bit of a bellwether moment.''
Atul Goyal, an analyst at the investment bank Jefferies in Singapore, wrote in a research note, ''This was well flagged.''
''The rationale for taking this impairment charge actually makes us bullish,'' he wrote. ''This has shown that a sensible C.F.O. is able to control the expansionary aspirations of business heads, which, if unchecked, would lead to larger losses for Sony.''
This year, Sony sold its computer division and spun off its television group into a separate unit.
In July, Sony said its midrange smartphones had not sold as well in emerging markets as it had expected, and it cut the sales volume forecast for smartphones to 43 million from 50 million.
''We believe the mobile business is one of our core businesses, along with the game network and imaging businesses,'' Mr. Hirai said. ''We will continue to do business in this big market.''
