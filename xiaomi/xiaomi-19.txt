<title:>World News: Asia: South Korea Struggles as Exports to China Falter

South Korea's economy failed to pick up in September as expected, deepening concerns over the recent poor performance of the country's exports to China.
Korea is an export powerhouse, but its shipments to China -- one of its largest markets -- are faltering because of increased competition from local producers. Samsung Electronics Co.'s third-quarter net profit, for instance, fell almost 50% on year, largely because rival Chinese handset manufacturers are snapping up market share.
Such developments are hurting Korea's economy, which exports huge amounts of parts to China for assembly, as well as finished goods. On Thursday, the government said industrial production grew only 0.1% on month in September, below economists' expectations of 1% growth.
That was a surprise because exports had recovered somewhat in September after declining in previous months. The disappointing data suggest manufacturers are running down inventories, says Yuanta Securities economist Lee Chul-hee -- hardly a vote of confidence in future exports to China.
The lackluster reading was "largely due to a surprise drop in electronics output, likely on the back of slower demand in China," said Barclays PLC economist Wai Ho Leong.
Consumer demand in China has been hit by an anticorruption drive by President Xi Jinping's administration. Lower-cost mobile handsets made by local companies such as Xiaomi Inc. also are eating South Korea's market share in China.
China is the destination of about a quarter of South Korea's total direct exports. Exports make up about half of South Korea's gross domestic product, and the country had regularly run double-digit export growth rates in the past. This year, the central bank expects the economy to grow a moderate 3.5% amid moribund exports.
President Park Geun-hye's government is trying to boost local demand to cut reliance on volatile overseas markets. In July, it announced a $40 billion stimulus package to encourage spending and jump-start the property market. The central bank cut interest rates in October to a record low of 2%.
The cuts so far have spurred neither the manufacturing sector nor local demand, with consumer confidence at a three-month low in October. The central bank's ability to further cut rates is limited given concerns over already high household debt levels, Mr. Lee said.
Seoul wants to deepen its domestic economy and move into higher-tech areas, fearing China soon will be a challenger in sectors such as electronics, steelmaking and ship building that South Korea has dominated until now.
A South Korean state research organization this week warned that Chinese manufacturers likely will catch up with or surpass their Korean rivals within five years in many areas. Some economists, though, say the threat to Korea has been overstated, betting that China is still far from closing in.
