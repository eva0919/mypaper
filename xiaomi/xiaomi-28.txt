SHANGHAI -- James W. Breyer, the venture capitalist who made a fortune with an early bet on Facebook, is putting some of his winnings to work in China, partnering with Beijing-based venture capital firm to invest in Chinese technology start-ups.
IDG Capital Partners said on Wednesday that Mr. Breyer, a longtime partner at Accel Partners in Palo Alto, Calif., would advise and invest alongside a $586 million IDG fund that closed June 3. The fund is expected to make early stage investments in Chinese technology, media and telecommunication companies.
The announcement comes as interest soars in Chinese technology companies after two years of frenzied deal-making, much of it involving China's Internet giants: Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. Those three companies alone have spent more than $10 billion buying up start-ups and rivals during the last few years.
And with other technology highfliers here, including JD.com, the Chinese e-commerce company that recently raised $1.78 billion in its New York public listing, China has rapidly become a prime destination for the world's biggest venture capital and private equity firms. Among the biggest and most active in China are Sequoia Capital, Qiming Ventures, SAIF Partners, IDG Capital Partners and Northern Light Venture Capital.
Mr. Breyer, 53, has been with Accel Partners since 1987. He has said recently that he will remain with Accel but devote more time to his family investment firm, Breyer Capital, and to doing philanthropic work. Last year, he was also elected to the Harvard Corporation, the university's governing board. He is a Harvard Business School graduate.
His relationship with Beijing-based IDG Capital Partners goes back to 2005, when Accel Partners began partnering with IDG to invest in Chinese companies. During that time, the five IDG-Accel Partners funds invested more than $2 billion in China. IDG Capital Partners' founding general partner is Hugo Shong, who was instrumental in bringing Mr. Breyer in as an investor.
IDG was founded by Patrick McGovern, who died this year. The Boston-based firm established an outpost in China in 1993, the first Chinese venture capital firm. That Beijing-based venture capital firm was an early stage investor in some of China's biggest technology start-ups, including Baidu, Tencent, Sohu and Ctrip. IDG Capital owns a stake in Xiaomi, the fast-growing Chinese smartphone maker, and once held a stake in 91 Wireless, the app store that was acquired by Baidu last year for $1.9 billion.
