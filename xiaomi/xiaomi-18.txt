Lenovo Group Ltd. said Thursday it completed its $2.91 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility, as the world's largest personal-computer maker continues its expansion in the global smartphone market.
The deal with Lenovo opens a new chapter for Motorola, which was unprofitable as a unit of Google Inc. Lenovo, which makes the ThinkPad line of PCs and Yoga line of tablet-PC convertibles, first unveiled its plans to buy Motorola from Google in January.
Motorola intends to turn around its business by taking advantage of Lenovo's efficient supply chain and distribution networks as well as economies of scale that could bring down material-procurement costs. Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing has said he expects to make Motorola profitable within four to six quarters after completing the deal.
Lenovo will operate Motorola as a wholly owned subsidiary. Motorola's headquarters will stay in Chicago and President Rick Osterloh will continue to head the business, while Liu Jun, the head of Lenovo's mobile business, will become Motorola's chairman, Lenovo said.
Founded in China, Lenovo bought International Business Machines Corp.'s PC business in 2005. The company, now based in both China and the U.S., overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. to become the No. 1 PC maker by shipments last year.
As the global PC market has become saturated, Lenovo is seeking new sources of growth by expanding its smartphone business, trying to take on Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. in the global market. In the third quarter, Lenovo was the world's fourth-largest smartphone vendor with a 5.2% share, behind Samsung, Apple and China's Xiaomi Inc., according to research firm IDC.
