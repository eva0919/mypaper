Jaguar Land Rover Opens
Its First Plant in China
Tata Motors Ltd.'s Jaguar Land Rover opened its first plant in China on Tuesday as part of a manufacturing push there, even as it sees moderating growth in luxury-car sales in the country.
The luxury-car maker said the factory will have a capacity of 130,000 cars and produce three models by 2016, including one Jaguar model, along with Chinese partner Chery Automobile Co. The first model to roll off the line will be the luxury Range Rover Evoque sport-utility vehicle, its most popular in China.
The plant is in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu, about 100 kilometers north of Shanghai. It is part of a 10.9 billion yuan ($1.78 billion) investment to bolster the auto maker's brands in the world's largest auto market.

XIAOMI
Handset Maker Weighs
Manufacturing in India
Xiaomi Inc., China's best-selling cellphone maker, is thinking of manufacturing its handsets in India.
The company just started selling its phones in India in July. Its early sales figures have been strong enough that it is already considering manufacturing in India, said Manu Jain, the head of Xiaomi's Indian arm.
"We always thought that our manufacturing would be based out of China," Mr. Jain said. "But India is beginning to become so important for us that we started to think whether we should set up our own manufacturing."
