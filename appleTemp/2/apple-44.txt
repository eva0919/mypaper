SYDNEY, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures fell on
Wednesday, edging away from a one-month peak touched in the
previous session as forecasts of favourable weather eased
concerns over harvest delays.
         
    FUNDAMENTALS  
    * Chicago Board of Trade front-month corn fell 0.3
percent to $3.55 a bushel, having gained 2.2 percent in the
previous session, when prices hit a one-month high of $3.58-3/4
a bushel.
    * Front-month soybeans fell 0.16 percent to $9.62-1/4
a bushel, having firmed 1.8 percent on Wednesday.
    * Front-month wheat rose 0.34 percent to $5.21 a
bushel, after closing up 1.1 percent on Tuesday when prices
marked a one-month high of $5.23-3/4 a bushel.
    * U.S. farmers had harvested 53 percent of their soybean
crop as of Sunday, up from 40 percent a week earlier but below
the five-year average of 66 percent, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said in a weekly crop report on Monday.
 
    * Rainy weather that slowed harvesting in the U.S. Midwest
this month also stalled the planting of winter wheat, a delay
that could threaten crop yields, experts said. 
    * Egypt, the world's top wheat importer, said on Tuesday it
had bought 180,000 tonnes of French, Romanian and Russian wheat
in an international tender.    
         
    MARKET NEWS  
    * The euro flirted with one-week lows on Wednesday following
a Reuters report that the European Central Bank is considering
buying corporate bonds, while recovery in risk appetite
underpinned the dollar against the yen.  
    * Brent crude oil ended up almost 1 percent on Tuesday,
helped by data showing stronger-than-expected China demand and
some technical price recovery after weeks of almost
uninterrupted selling.  
    * U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 notching
a fourth straight session of gains boosted by strong corporate
results, including Apple's.
