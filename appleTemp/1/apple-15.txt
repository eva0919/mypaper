Apple may or may not strike a partnership with Alibaba, but the iPhone maker has strong reasons for wanting to find new ways to grow its business in China.
During onstage interviews at the WSJD Live conference Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alibaba CEO Jack Ma threw out hints they would like to work together, possibly on something involving Alibaba¡¦s online payment service called Alipay. Theoretically, the service could work with Apple¡¦s Touch ID function embedded on the newest iPhones. But many questions remain, especially given Apple¡¦s drive to grow its own payment service.
What is clear is that the Chinese market grows more important for Apple with each passing year. Its annual securities filing, also out Monday, showed Greater China to be the fastest-growing of the company¡¦s geographic segments¡Xand the only one that grew its share of Apple¡¦s overall revenue in the 2014 fiscal year. China even grew sales of the iPad, which saw a decline in other markets.
Apple may not always play well with others. But with its eyes on China, it could be more motivated to make new friends.
