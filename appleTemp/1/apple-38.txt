James Dimon won't like this.
Back in 2011, J.P. Morgan Chase and its chief relinquished the title of biggest U.S. bank by market value to Wells Fargo. Now comes a further indignity: J.P. Morgan's market value late last week was overtaken by Facebook's. This happened as the tech giant, which reports results Tuesday, issued new shares to fund its purchase of WhatsApp. Markets didn't ding Facebook for the dilution, so its value rose. It was worth $224 billion Monday versus about $221 billion for J.P. Morgan.
Facebook joins the ranks of tech stalwarts such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, all with market values bigger than J.P. Morgan's. Tech's dominance is really clear when you look at Apple: J.P. Morgan and Wells have a combined market value equal to only three-quarters that of the iPhone maker. No wonder graduates increasingly choose Silicon Valley over Wall Street these days.
