LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - After a heated bidding war that had most of the majors vying for it over the weekend, Open Road has won the U.S. rights to the untitled spec revolving around the Edward Snowden story that has Oliver Stone directing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt starring.

As Deadline Hollywood reported earlier in the week, studio execs first received the script Friday afternoon with the first offers coming in sometime that evening. Wild Bunch has nabbed the international rights.

Stone is writing and directing and will produce with Eric Kopeloff and Moritz Borman.

Snowden's story is now familiar to most: the former U.S. intelligence analyst released more classified documents than anyone since Daniel Ellsberg's leaking of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. He has been on the run ever since.

Stone acquired the rights to the book "Time of the Octopus" by Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, which is considered the closest thing to a documented account of the events since Snowden first released the documents.

Production would likely begin at the end of the year or in the early first quarter of 2015, which is a good thing given that this isn't the only Snowden project in town. Sony already has the rights to "No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State" with the James Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli of EON Productions producing the pic.

Deadline first broke the Open Road news.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Season five of Jerry Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" on Sony's Crackle digital network bowed Thursday, with the premiere featuring Kevin Hart and Jerry tooling around in a 1959 Porsche RSK Spyder on a "weird male date."

The latest season of the show -- which Crackle has said is its most-popular content with more than 70 million views to date -- will also feature episodes with NBC's "The Tonight Show" host Jimmy Fallon, Amy Schumer, Fred Armisen, Bill Burr, Ali Wentworth and YouTube star Miranda Sings, the awkward character created by comedian and singer Colleen Ballinger.

The first episode of season five of "Comedian in Cars Getting Coffee" includes a guest appearance by former "Seinfeld" cast-mate Michael Richards as "Dick Corcoran," the cigar-chomping president of Crackle who tells Jerry the network is going bankrupt because of what it's spending on the cars-and-coffee series. Season five will run seven episodes in all.

The webseries costs about $100,000 per episode to produce, Seinfeld told David Letterman this summer in an interview at the Paley Center for Media in New York.

Seinfeld is executive producer of "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee," produced by Sony Pictures Television's Embassy Row.

Pay-TV 몬Cord Cutting몭 Accelerates; Subscriber Defections Begin to Hit Satellite TV; Price of Bills Cited

The pay-TV industry contracted in the third quarter at a faster pace than a year earlier, signaling that 몮cord cutting몯 is accelerating as more consumers drop cable and satellite-TV connections.

Overall, the pay-TV industry lost about 179,000 TV customers, a steeper loss from the decline of 83,000 in the year-earlier quarter, according to public company reports and estimates from Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson LLC. Already, more homes and businesses have dropped pay-TV service in the first three quarters of this year than in the whole of last year, MoffettNathanson estimates.

Subscriber defections came at all the major cable and satellite-TV providers, including Comcast Corp. and DirecTV. On Thursday, Cablevision Systems Corp. said it lost 56,000 video customers, bringing its total to roughly 2.7 million.

Cablevision Chief Executive James Dolan acknowledged the shifting winds in the industry as 몮over the top몯 streaming video services lure customers away from traditional pay TV. 몮Ultimately cord-cutting and going to over the top is something we do believe is going to happen and we are preparing ourselves for it,몯 he said, noting the company몭s investments in its broadband network. Cablevision on Thursday reported a 3.7% increase in revenue thanks to rate increases and higher advertising revenue.

Video customer bases shrank at satellite-TV providers as well, which is unusual in a quarter where they typically grow. For years, satellite-TV companies posted gains by taking customers from cable providers, but in the third quarter they lost 40,000 subscribers, compared to a gain of 174,000 a year ago. 몮Growth is hitting a wall,몯 said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, conjecturing that the increasing importance of broadband may finally be starting to weigh on satellite providers몭 results.

DirecTV, long known for its operational expertise and premium brand, said Thursday that it lost 28,000 customers in the quarter. The company also said it is experiencing a higher volume of customer calls relating to the amount of the bill, as people become more price-sensitive in a discount-heavy environment. Customers who leave are 몮mentioning price-value and I see more of them claiming they몭re going to no pay TV,몯 said DirecTV Chief Executive Mike White on an earnings conference call. Indeed, several pay TV providers including DirecTV and Cablevision say their subscriber losses were driven in part by their own strategies to let discount-seeking customers fall to the wayside, focusing instead on attracting 몮higher value몯 subscribers willing to pay more.

DirecTV also said the percentage of its customers defecting to cable edged up.

The net contraction for the wider industry was driven by the weaker performance of satellite companies and slower growth at the TV operations of telecom providers Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., which together added a combined 330,000, versus 400,000 in the year-ago quarter.

Cable-TV companies actually slowed video customer losses from an estimated 657,000 losses last year to 469,000, thanks in part to more customers choosing newer, cheaper bundles of slimmed-down pay-TV offerings with fast broadband.

The pay-TV industry is under assault from multiple sides. While some customers are cutting the cord entirely, others are simply 몮shaving몯 it by switching to smaller channel packages that cost less. Many operators are aggressively marketing such offerings, figuring it is better to make less revenue off those customers than lose them altogether. Others, including DirecTV and Dish Network Corp., are jumping into the streaming game with their own online video services to be released this year, aimed at households that don몭t subscribe to pay television.

The pay-TV industry몭s contraction has major implications for TV channel-owners, too. Their growth is increasingly powered by the subscription fees they receive from pay-TV operators, especially given softness in the advertising market.

Pay-TV and media executives broadly acknowledge that some people are dropping their pay-TV subscriptions, but many maintain it몭s still a marginal loss given that the overall U.S. market has about 100 million pay-TV homes.

A host of new streaming launches in coming quarters will test the strength of the traditional pay-TV ecosystem. Sony Corp., for example, has said it plans to debut an online video service by the end of the year. Time Warner Inc.몭s HBO and CBS Corp.몭s Showtime have plans to launch standalone streaming versions of their premium channels next year. CBS three weeks ago launched a $5.99-per-month service that streams CBS programming live and on-demand, except for NFL football.

Real Estate
City Living Comes to Downtown Nashville; The capital of country is growing more urban with neighborhoods like the Gulch, SoBro and Germantown

The capital of country is getting citified.

Nashville몭s once-sleepy downtown neighborhoods are in the midst of a transformation: Cranes dotting the skyline are constructing high-rise apartments, condos, hotels and office towers. Tourism has gotten a jolt from a popular eponymous television drama, as well as a new $585 million, 2.1 million-square-foot convention center. And the real-estate market is booming, as young adults and empty-nesters flock to new neighborhoods in search of walkability and proximity to the action.

Perhaps the most dramatic turnaround can be seen in the Gulch, formerly a forgotten industrial area that many locals weren몭t familiar with a decade ago. Today, people walk along winding sidewalks with benches and street lamps. There are high-rise and midrise condo and apartment buildings with roof-deck pools and cabanas. Bearded baristas serve artisanal pour-over brews at coffee shops.

Sony Music Nashville recently announced that it would relocate its offices from Nashville몭s Music Row to the Gulch. Developer MarketStreet, which owns much of the property in the neighborhood, said $600 million has been invested in the area so far and another $500 million will be put into residential, retail and office development by MarketStreet and other developers in the coming years

몮Ten years ago멞you never came here. There was nothing here,몯 said Scott Evans, a broker with Parks Urban Real Estate Gallery, which opened an office in the Gulch in 2012 with eight agents. It now has 38. Other downtown neighborhoods like SoBro, south of Broadway and home to the Country Music Hall of Fame, and Germantown, just north of downtown, are on the rise as well.

The population of downtown Nashville nearly quadrupled to 7,685 between 2000 and 2014, compared with 21% growth citywide to about 659,000, according to the Nashville Downtown Partnership. Prices for downtown condos average about $390 a square foot, up from $128 a square foot in 2004, according to the Nashville Downtown Partnership몭s Residential Report.

It몭s a big shift for this southern city that has long been known for neighborhoods of Colonial homes and early 20th-century bungalows. Before 1994, residential development of any kind was barred in most of downtown.

The local economy is booming, boosted partly by the area몭s $30 billion health-care industry. The city몭s gross metro product grew 4.2% in 2013, double the national average, according to an IHS Global report. It is expected to top $100 billion by the end of this year.

Jennifer Lee, a 37-year-old dermatologist who moved to Nashville in 2010 from Boston, said the city몭s new urban landscape made the move easier. She purchased a $356,000, one-bedroom condominium in the Icon, a 424-unit, 22-story building in the Gulch with floor-ceiling windows and an outdoor pool deck. 몮When we moved in, the building was half empty,몯 she said. The neighborhood 몮just exploded in the last year.몯

Jay Turner, a local developer whose family made its fortune creating Dollar General variety stores, and his partners saw that Nashville had fallen behind in the residential-driven urban revival many other U.S. cities had experienced. So 15 years ago their company, MarketStreet, decided to purchase much of the property and vacant lots around the city몭s rail yard.

MarketStreet joined with the city to redo the neighborhood몭s infrastructure and streets and christened the area the Gulch, a historic term for the area that had fallen out of use. In 2002, MarketStreet opened the first residential building, a 32-unit apartment complex. It leased quickly, prompting development of more apartments and condos.

The financial crisis stalled development for a few years, but agents say condo sales have bounced back, with resale prices surpassing their precrash highs. That has prompted developers to move forward with projects like Twelve Twelve, a 286-unit building under construction. Prices in the building range from $375,000 for one-bedrooms to about $3 million for three-bedroom penthouses, potentially a record for Nashville.

Twelve Twelve몭s developer, Ray Hensler, built his previous condominium, the Adelicia, in Midtown, attracting buyers like Taylor Swift and Kelly Clarkson. Standing in an empty 2,000-square-foot penthouse with wide-plank floors, Mr. Hensler said he has shifted his focus to the Gulch, because it 몮has emerged as the most sought-after district.몯

Residents say there are downsides to living in the Gulch. Rail yards bring loud freight trains through the area a couple of times a day. The streetscape of mostly modern buildings lacks the historic, haphazard charm of cities like New York or Chicago. 몮It몭s been amazing to see the transformation,몯 said Megan Youngblood. A 35-year-old who works in systems engineering at Vanderbilt University, she moved out of the Gulch to Germantown a few months ago. But 몮I think the Gulch is trying to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up.몯

Although the neighborhood is set up to be walkable, most residents still commute by car. In 2010, the city started a free shuttle-bus service, and bike share was recently added. Karl Dean, the city몭s mayor, has backed a plan to build an $18 million pedestrian bridge linking the Gulch to SoBro, financed by developers in the Gulch. 몮The Gulch is clearly working, but it몭s separated [from downtown] by the railroad tracks,몯 said Mr. Dean. 몮You gotta connect the dots.몯 The plan received its final approval from the city council last month. Mr. Turner, the developer, said the addition of offices will also promote pedestrian commuting.

Affordability in Nashville is a growing concern. The city has long attracted artists partly because its housing costs are relatively low when compared with other music and performance hubs like Los Angeles and New York. Mr. Dean said the city is encouraging more developments like Ryman Lofts, a 60-unit affordable apartment complex for artists and musicians just south of downtown in Rolling Mill Hill, another up-and-coming area. Rents there start at $582 a month for studios. MarketStreet said its buildings include affordable units, and the company is actively looking into how to add more in the Gulch.

Real-estate agents and developers said their biggest problem is a lack of high-end inventory and larger units that would appeal to older, wealthier buyers. Most of the Gulch몭s apartment and condo complexes are comprised primarily of small one- and two-bedroom units.

Charlyn Jarrells, a 50-year-old Arkansas native who retired early from her job as an executive at Wal-Mart, decided to settle in Nashville after living in Seattle, where she lived in a 38th-floor condo. 몮I loved not having a yard to take care of,몯 she said.

When she came to Nashville, she wanted a place on a high floor with views, but had a hard time finding anything larger than a one-bedroom. So she purchased two adjacent units in the Gulch몭s Icon. She paid about $1 million for both, including a $125,000 credit she could put toward combining them, for a total of about 1,950 square feet of living space. Her unit has wide-plank hardwood floors and views of Ryman Auditorium and the State Capitol from wall-size windows. 몮I could not be happier with where I몭ve landed,몯 she said.

The hunt is already on for the next Gulch. On a recent afternoon, Mark Deutschmann, a real-estate broker and developer, drove around Wedgewood-Houston, a somewhat sparse industrial and residential neighborhood south of downtown. A few art galleries and studios have appeared, including one in an old hosiery mill, as well as recording studios and distilleries.

He purchased an 8? acre parcel for $4.5 million, and plans to break ground on a mixed-use condominium development early next year. 몮It몭s really just starting,몯 he said.

Lenovo몭s Quarterly Profit Jumps 19%; Growth in Europe Helps the PC Maker Shrug Off Declining Revenue in China

HONG KONG멪Lenovo Group Ltd. said Thursday its net profit for the quarter through September rose 19% thanks to growing sales of both personal computers and smartphones.

The world몭s largest PC maker by shipments said net profit rose to $262 million from $220 million a year earlier, largely in line with analysts몭 expectations. Revenue, however, came in below analysts몭 projections, rising 7% to $10.48 billion from $9.77 billion.

Lenovo said revenue in China, its biggest market, decreased 2% in the quarter from a year earlier. But revenue in Europe rose 33%, making up for the slowdown in China.

The company몭s smartphone shipments rose 38% from a year earlier. But revenue from its mobile devices division, which also includes tablets, fell 6%.

Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said the decline in mobile device revenue, despite shipment growth, was partly because many of the phones shipped near the end of the quarter hadn몭t yet contributed to revenue.

Lenovo has a challenge integrating two businesses it bought recently. A week ago, the company said it completed its $2.91 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility from Google Inc., while earlier in October it closed a $2.1 billion deal to buy International Business Machines Corp.몭s low-end server business.

Analysts say Lenovo몭s earnings may be hurt in the coming quarters by costs associated with the integration of the two businesses. Mr. Yang Yuanqing has also warned that the acquisitions will likely weigh on the company몭s bottom line in the near term. Mr. Yang has said he aims to turn loss-making Motorola profitable within six quarters of completing the deal.

Lenovo, which was founded in China, bought IBM몭s PC business in 2005. The company, now based in both China and the U.S., overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. to become the world몭s No. 1 PC maker by shipments last year. As the global PC market has become saturated, Lenovo is seeking new sources of growth by expanding its smartphone and server businesses.

Separately, Lenovo said Thursday that it has appointed Yahoo Inc. co-founder Jerry Yang as an independent board director. Of Lenovo몭s 11-member board, eight are independent directors, including former Sony Corp. Chief Executive Nobuyuki Idei and Tudor Brown, a co-founder of U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings PLC.

Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine몭s School for Innovation; After the runaway success of Beats멪recently bought by Apple for $3 billion멪the duo is launching a new academy at the University of Southern California with the goal of inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs

IF JIMMY IOVINE has a trademark, it몭s his hat. For decades, the record producer turned label boss turned headphones magnate turned all-around music-biz oracle has rarely appeared in public without something atop his head, be it a casual wintry wool knit number or a navy blue baseball cap featuring the logo of his multi-billion-dollar corporation, Beats. What Steve Jobs was to mock turtlenecks or Phil Knight is to the swoosh, Iovine is to hats. And yet, it was still slightly incongruous to see him last May, standing at a podium in front of the University of Southern California몭s graduating class of 2014, sporting a poofy doctoral tam with a gold tassel dangling from its side.

Iovine was there to deliver USC몭s commencement speech, in which he regaled the graduates with a story about making tea for John Lennon and quoted lines from his 몮favorite poet,몯 R. Kelly. But he also took the opportunity to promote his latest project: an interdisciplinary program called the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. A joint venture between Iovine and his business partner, Andre Young멪better known as the hip-hop super-producer Dr. Dre멪the academy, which matriculated its inaugural 31-member freshman class in August, features a curriculum that weds its three titular disciplines (art, tech and commerce) in a way that befits the current cultural landscape. They want to create a dream factory, Iovine said in his speech, that will 몮inspire, challenge, and satisfy the curiosity of the next wave of game-changers.몯

Iovine and Dre know about changing the game. For two and a half decades, Iovine, 61, was the head of Interscope Records (later Interscope Geffen A&M), where he helped oversee the careers of U2, Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefani and the Black Eyed Peas. Dr. Dre, 49, is a legendary producer with six Grammys and hundreds of millions in sales to his name, who has helped guide proteges such as Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent and Eminem. Together, they launched their company, Beats Electronics, in 2008, building it from a start-up headphone manufacturer with cool celebrity endorsements into a technology brand so lucrative that Apple recently paid $3 billion for it. Now Dre and Iovine are using $70 million to fund their school.

As Iovine explains it, the school is as much an investment in their own future as it is philanthropy. 몮We wanted to build a school that we feel is what the entertainment industry needs right now,몯 he says. 몮There몭s a new kid in town, and he몭s brought up on an iPad from one and a half years old. But the problem with some of the companies up north [in Silicon Valley] is that they really are culturally inept. I몭ve been shocked at the different species in Northern and Southern California멪we don몭t even speak the same language. The kid who몭s going to have an advantage in the entertainment industry today is the kid who speaks both languages: technology and liberal arts. That몭s what this school is about.

몮The problem with the school system is that a lot of it몭s cookie-cutter,몯 he adds, 몮so what we몭re trying to do is disrupt it a bit.몯

In other words: They몭ve revolutionized hip-hop. They몭ve revolutionized headphones. Now can they revolutionize college?

ON A BLAZING AFTERNOON at the end of August, Iovine and Dre are at a mansion in Encino, California, watching a fake pool party take place. The mansion doesn몭t belong to either of them; it몭s a location for a movie about Dr. Dre몭s old hip-hop group, N.W.A., which is filming now and scheduled to be released next year. Production assistants scurry from room to room, and scantily clad extras drift by in early-몭90s-era swimwear. Dre몭s wife of 18 years, Nicole, is also on set. 몮This is a big deal,몯 Dr. Dre says with a sly grin. 몮We got Jimmy to the Valley.몯 (Iovine, who몭s not a fan of inconvenience, jokes that he almost founded the academy at UCLA instead, because it몭s closer to his home in Santa Monica. 몮I could walk there!몯 he says, laughing. 몮Every time I몭d drive to USC, I몭d be like, how much is this costing?몯)

Growing up in Compton, California, Andre Young attended Centennial High School but was a so-so student and dropped out in order to pursue music. He spent his college-age years DJ몭ing at clubs, until he and his friend Eazy-E formed N.W.A. (Ice Cube joined soon thereafter.) Although he grew up just 10 miles from the USC campus and was a big Trojans football fan, it was never a real possibility for Dre to go there. 몮I would have loved to go to that school,몯 Dre says wistfully. 몮But I didn몭t have that opportunity.몯

Iovine was raised similarly far from academia, the son of a longshoreman in Red Hook, Brooklyn. He spent a year and a half at Manhattan몭s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, but it was 몮a complete bust.몯 몮School was not my thing,몯 Iovine says. 몮I put down the wrong thing on the application멪I checked off five city schools, and that was the one they sent me to. There were 48 people in the class, and 46 were cops. The only thing I knew about criminology was Batman.몯 At 19 he got a job sweeping the floors at a Manhattan recording studio, and from there worked his way into a gig as a recording engineer for John Lennon. Within a few years, he was engineering albums for Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty.

Dre and Iovine met in 1992, after Dre had put the finishing touches on his first solo album, The Chronic. Iovine had co-founded Interscope two years earlier, and he was looking for some talent. 몮I wasn몭t a fan of hip-hop,몯 Iovine recalls. 몮They were playing me hip-hop because Interscope was going to be in the hip-hop business, but it all sounded muddy to me. I몭m a recording engineer멪it just offended me sonically. Then Dre brought in his record, and it sounded as cool as Pink Floyd or Sgt. Pepper몭s. I said, 몬Who mixed this?몭 and he said, 몬Me.몭 And I said, 몬No, no, but who engineered it?몭 And he said, 몬Me!몭 And I said, 몬OK, I몭m getting into business with you.몭 몯

Dre went on to form his own subsidiary of Interscope, Aftermath, which launched the careers of 50 Cent and Eminem. He and Iovine say the qualities that made them mesh well as record executives also helped them succeed with Beats: 몮We just trust each other,몯 Iovine says. 몮He몭s as good a producer and engineer as Michael Jordan is a basketball player. He has an incredible patience that I don몭t. And he몭s a good touchstone for me. Every time we start going off one way, he몭ll say, 몬Nah, man멪we몭re getting corny.몭 몯

Beats started with a chance run-in on the beach. Iovine was in Malibu, at his friend David Geffen몭s house, when he decided to go for a stroll. He happened upon Dr. Dre, who was out on the balcony of his own house nearby. Dre told him he몭d been approached a few days earlier by an athletic company about doing a shoe line; his lawyer wanted him to do it, but Dre wasn몭t sure. (몮I몭m not into fashion,몯 he says. 몮I wear the same s멪 every day.몯) He asked Iovine for his thoughts. Iovine몭s immortal response: 몮F멪 sneakers멪let몭s make speakers.몯

몮It몭s a good thing they didn몭t want to sell aluminum,몯 Iovine jokes now. 몮I몭m not sure what rhymes with that.몯

Beats headphones have been criticized by audiophiles who insist they몭re far from the best headphones on the market. Yet helped by Dre몭s musical cachet, Iovine몭s marketing savvy and a raft of celebrity endorsements (Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, LeBron James), the company earned $1.2 billion last year alone. It can make a pair of headphones for $40 that sells for over $200; one Swarovski-studded model retails for more than $1,000. And Marc Jacobs incorporated Beats headphones into his runway show this fall.

Earlier this year Beats expanded its mission, unveiling a music-streaming service, Beats Music, designed to compete with the Pandoras and Spotifys of the world. It몭s not immediately obvious that headphones would lead to streaming; after all, it몭s not like Nike ever broadcast a basketball game. But Iovine has been an advocate of streaming for years. 몮Streaming was actually first,몯 he says. 몮I couldn몭t get it done. I didn몭t have the platform. But once I had Beats, I had the platform. It몭s a piece of equipment, a piece of hardware. And I wanted to build a piece of software that worked with it.몯

When Apple announced it was acquiring Beats, it was the culmination of a long flirtation between the two companies. Thirteen years ago, Iovine was one of the first people Steve Jobs showed iTunes to, when Jobs was trying to get the music industry on board with the idea. And Iovine had been shopping a subscription music service to Apple, including to Jobs personally, within a couple of years of the launch of iTunes. (Jobs, long a skeptic of subscription services, passed.) 몮Every deal I made, I offered to Apple,몯 Iovine says. 몮I only wanted to work with Apple.몯

Since the acquisition, analysts have focused on three possible explanations for why Apple wanted Beats. One is that it몭s buying the hardware: As Apple expands into more wearable products (e.g., its new smartwatch), Beats gives it a valuable foothold, especially in the youth market. Second is that it몭s buying its software: the proprietary algorithms and expert-curated playlists that it hopes will position Beats ahead of its streaming rivals. The third theory is the most intriguing: What Apple is really buying are Iovine and Dre. Since Jobs died, the thinking goes, Apple has lacked the kind of magnetic personality who can serve as the company몭s face멪someone with creative vision, deep industry ties and the ability to close a deal. In musical terms, it needs a frontman. As Jobs몭s biographer Walter Isaacson recently speculated to Billboard, Iovine, especially, might be that face.

For his part, Iovine shrugs this off. 몮I몭m just the ornament on the hood멪and I don몭t mean because I몭m sexy.몯

Iovine and Dre won몭t, or perhaps can몭t, share many specifics about their new roles at Apple just yet. But listening to them talk, it몭s clear that what몭s occupying their thoughts right now is the idea of integrating the people who create art with those who distribute it. 몮I think what you몭re seeing more and more are companies that are designed to do multiple things,몯 Iovine says. 몮If you look at the Beats model, there몭s software and hardware. Look at what Amazon is doing; look at what Google몭s trying to do. It몭s technology and content in one.몯 As both an example and a cautionary tale, he cites Sony. 몮They had it,몯 Iovine says. 몮They had the Walkman, they had the PlayStation. And they bought Columbia Pictures and Columbia Records, so they had the content. But they never finished the thought멪and Apple ended up with the products. Where do you think Steve got the idea?몯

At heart, this is what the Iovine and Young Academy is about멪creating the kind of student who can design the next PlayStation and sell it, too. Iovine and Dre aren몭t exactly drawing up lesson plans or keeping office hours. (As Iovine likes to point out, David Geffen doesn몭t teach surgery at his medical school.) But they are scheduled to appear at the academy몭s lecture series, and Iovine recently hosted a barbecue for the incoming freshmen at his house.

몮Dre, how did you find talking to the kids the other day?몯 he asks.

몮I mean, I was the one doing most of the talking,몯 Dre says.

Iovine chuckles. 몮They were terrified!몯

몮There are a lot of other programs around the country that marry business and technology,몯 says Erica Muhl, the dean of USC몭s Roski School of Art and Design and the Iovine and Young Academy몭s first executive director. 몮But they몭re all missing that arts and cultural component. The difference with us is we start with the arts part.몯 Says Iovine: 몮We want kids who can work at Beats or at Apple.몯

CBS Promises Streaming Service as Earnings Jump; Media Company몭s Revenue Rises 2%, Helped by Higher Licensing and Advertising Fees

CBS Corp. said Wednesday its pay channel Showtime will follow the lead of rival HBO and offer its programming through a streaming service available to people who don몭t have pay television subscriptions.

Speaking to analysts on the company몭s third quarter earnings call, CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said 몮fairly definitively몯 Showtime will have such an 몮over-the-top몯 Web offering in 2015. CBS has already launched such a service for its broadcast network and on Thursday it will debut a streaming news service called CBSN.

Programmers such as CBS and Time Warner Inc.몭s HBO are aggressively looking for new ways to reach viewers that may be eschewing traditional cable and satellite television. CBS also said it had reached an agreement to have its content streamed on a new over-the-top video service being launched by Sony Corp.

In its traditional TV business, CBS몭s growth in the third quarter came primarily from content-licensing and the subscription fees paid by pay TV operators. That was partially offset by a soft advertising market. The entertainment segment멪which includes the television network, CBS Television studios and CBS Films멪reported revenue grew 1.4% to $1.91 billion.

The cable networks unit reported revenue rose 4.7% to $624 million, mostly on revenue from the licensing of Showtime original series, as well as increases in affiliate revenue at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks.

Over all, CBS reported a profit of $1.64 billion, or $3.03 a share, which included a $1.56 billion gain related to its spinoff of the outdoor advertising company CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. A year ago, the company had earnings of $494 million, or 80 cents a share. Excluding restructuring-related charges, write-downs related to a radio station swap and other items, earnings from continuing operations were 74 cents a share.

Revenue increased 2% to $3.37 billion. Content licensing and distribution revenue grew 4.3% to $1.4 billion, thanks to increased international and domestic licensing of television programming.

CBS is anticipating a battle with satellite operator Dish Network Corp. as the companies renegotiate their carriage contract, which expires at the end of this month. Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said Tuesday that the CBS broadcast network몭s new online service 몮makes that product less interesting몯 for pay-TV operators because 몮customers have a choice to get it somewhere else.몯

CBS몭s Mr. Moonves, noting that the network몭s ratings are up this season, sounded confident about the Dish situation. 몮We몭re determined to get paid fair value for our programming. We know how to get this done and rest assured we will,몯 he said.

Mr. Moonves also touted new affiliation deals with LIN Media, Tribune Broadcasting, Media General and Gray Television that have the company on track to take in $2 billion in revenues by 2020 for carriage of its programming.

Why Hollywood Went Gaga for Alibaba During Jack Ma's Big Trip

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The Alibaba money-train pulled into Hollywood last week as studios and talent agencies rolled out the welcome mat for founder-exec chairman Jack Ma and his team of content-hungry executives.

It was a certifiable love-fest, as China's richest man dusted off his cinephile status during a Q&A session at the WSJD Live conference, telling entertainment industry power brokers that "The Bodyguard," "Forrest Gump" and "The Godfather" movies rank among his favorites. More important than insight into his Netflix queue was that Ma made it clear he brought his checkbook with him on the trans-Pacific flight.

"I come here to learn. I come here to look for partners," Ma said.

Despite a slew of meetings and a warchest of $25 billion from Alibaba's recent public offering, it's not clear Ma will be signing many checks just yet.

"They're kicking the tires of the car," says media analyst Hal Vogel. "It's not a question of do they have the money. They're still in the discovery phase of 'What should we do and how should we do it?' "

Movie chiefs and agents were only too happy to lay out the possible ways Ma could go on a spending spree.

The Alibaba chief took a meeting with Paramount CEO Brad Grey and vice-chairman Rob Moore. A sitdown between Ma, Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton and Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chair Amy Pascal resulted in preliminary discussions about a co-financing pact. Ma's team met with Universal's top brass, Fox Studio chief Jim Gianopulos, Lionsgate executives and Relativity Media's leadership. Zhang Qiang, CEO of Alibaba Pictures, was often Ma's ambassador after the technology baron traveled to the Silicon Valley area to meet with his U.S. staff later in the week.

Left off Ma's dance card, at least this time, was Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara, although the studio chief expects to meet with him at some point. Ma's team stressed to the executives it met with that not only was Alibaba eager to distribute their films and television programs, but that the company understands the importance of copyright protections. Piracy is a huge issue in China, so these assurances must have resonated.

The American executives who met the Internet entrepreneur came away impressed. One studio chief who met Ma described him as "unassuming, smart, confident -- and someone who loves movies."

Studios weren't the only ones making a pitch to Ma. CAA's leaders talked with Alibaba, while WME's Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell sat down to discuss ways their roster of A-list clients could work with the Chinese e-commerce giant. Emanuel and Whitesell then took the relationship public by hosting Ma courtside at the Lakers' season-opener at Staples Center.

"That was an obvious signal to the marketplace that 'I'm an insider, not just a technology company,' " says one media and entertainment investor. "It's about making and building relationships."

What Alibaba wants is content for its set-top boxes, and as the box office success of "Iron Man 3" and "Transformers: Age of Extinction" demonstrates, China has a great appetite for Hollywood movies. Alibaba already has signed licensing deals with Lionsgate, and Ma and his lieutenant are eager to lock up distribution pacts for movies and shows, and to hammer out licensing pacts for his company's streaming service.

"We have a vast distribution network of approximately 300 million users, with 100 million people coming to our sites every day," says Robert Christie, a spokesman for Alibaba. "Providing an outstanding customer experience is one of our primary objectives for 2015, and providing quality content is one way to achieve that goal."

Hollywood has had a delicate relationship with China for years, but there are indications that things are improving. In the past, many executives traveled to the country, with high hopes that they could break into its market of 1.4 billion people and access its rivers of cash, only to end those expeditions empty-handed. However, several recent flirtations have been consummated -- Jeff Robinov's Studio 8, for instance, secured backing from China's Fosun Group; and Robert Simonds' new studio is being partly supported by Hony Capital. In the case of Alibaba, its public status and burgeoning network of customers and services shows a clear opportunity.

"One of the holy grails for the movie business has been, 'How do you get into China, '" says Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. "It's a difficult market to (crack), but finding a partner like (Alibaba) might be an ideal way to go about it."

The recent whirlwind tour was seen as mostly a fact-finding mission for Ma, and insiders expect that any deals that come out of it will be co-productions or joint ventures. That said, should Alibaba want to lay down roots, it has the financial heft to buy a studio.

Ma speaks English fluently and understands the cultural currency that Hollywood boasts. His biggest obstacle to attaining a fruitful relationship may be his own country: China's strict censors could wreak havoc on any deep investment in the entertainment business he might want to make here.

"Doors are wide open to him anywhere in Hollywood, because he's got a bankroll. But he's got a dilemma," Vogel says. "He's got the right idea about what his customers and viewers want, and he has an understanding of American culture. But he doesn't have a free hand, because of the Chinese government."

Some things money can't buy.

Warner Music Group Signs Deal to License Music to SoundCloud; Warner Is First Major Record Label to Start Earning Money From German Audio-Sharing Site

Warner Music Group has signed a deal to license its music to SoundCloud Ltd., the companies said, making Warner the first major record label to start earning money from the German audio-sharing website.

SoundCloud will pay royalties to both Warner Music and its publishing division, Warner/Chappell Music, each time one of the songs they몭ve opted to monetize is streamed on its free, ad-supported service, as well as for songs played on a new subscription service, according to a person familiar with the matter.

SoundCloud plans to launch the subscription service in the first half of next year, said SoundCloud Chief Executive Alexander Ljung. The record company몭s decision to sign the deal had hinged upon the guaranteed launch of the paid subscription service, which will likely offer consumers different levels of access for different monthly prices. SoundCloud will continue to offer a free listening option as well, Mr. Ljung said.

Currently SoundCloud is free for listeners, about 175 million of whom visit the site each month. Internet radio company Pandora Media Inc., by comparison, has nearly 80 million active monthly users, while on-demand music service Spotify AB has 40 million, about 10 million of whom pay for $10-a-month subscriptions.

Musicians and DJs who want to upload songs, mixes and mashups onto SoundCloud in significant volume pay a monthly fee. As of now, record companies don몭t earn money from the site, nor do artists, music publishers or songwriters. Any such copyright holders can request to have their content removed from the site if users put it up without their permission.

Record labels have allowed much of their content to remain on the site, however, on the theory that the exposure might help drive sales or listening on other services that do pay. Most commonly, labels remove music that has been leaked prematurely, or at the request of a particular artist.

SoundCloud started advertising on the site this summer to bring in revenue that could pave the way for licensing deals. It is already sharing revenue with about 40 partners, from independent labels to individual artists, but Warner Music is the first major label to sign on.

The deal doesn몭t require Warner Music, the smallest of the three global music companies, to license its entire catalog to SoundCloud. That is because SoundCloud users visit the site mostly to discover underground artists or hear fresh remixes of popular tunes, so the service doesn몭t feel compelled to maintain the kind of 25-million-song library offered by unlimited-subscription streaming companies such as Spotify and Apple Inc.몭s Beats Music.

Warner, whose roster includes the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bruno Mars and Led Zeppelin, will also earn royalties when bits of its songs are spliced into mashups, not just when its songs are streamed in their entirety. Warner is owned by billionaire Len Blavatnik몭s Access Industries Inc.

As part of the deal, Warner will also take a stake in SoundCloud, according to people familiar with the matter, in line with the 3% to 5% slice that record labels had discussed taking earlier this summer.

Spotify gave major labels equity several years ago as part of a deal to get that service licensed in the U.S.

Warner Music Chief Operating Officer Rob Wiesenthal said it was difficult to say how much revenue SoundCloud could ultimately generate for the label, but added that the site has a particularly 몮passionate following몯 compared with other digital music services.

Warner Music몭s rivals have taken a cautious approach to dealing with SoundCloud. Interviewed at The Wall Street Journal몭s WSJD Live technology conference, Lucian Grainge, chairman of Vivendi SA몭s Universal Music Group, said last week there is an 몮opportunity for SoundCloud to create incredible revenue.몯 But, he added, he would first need to hear 몮what the business plan is going to be.몯 He added that he doesn몭t believe advertising alone generates sufficient revenue to adequately compensate music companies or their artists. He indicated that subscription services that charge users recurring fees are more acceptable. Neither Universal Music nor Sony Corp.몭s Sony Music Entertainment have moved any closer to licensing deals with SoundCloud in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.

Discovery International Business Again Drives Growth; Media Company Trims Revenue Forecast After Quarterly Results Miss Expectations

Strong international growth drove Discovery Communications Inc.몭s profits 10% higher in the third quarter, even as weak TV ratings and ad sales at its domestic channels contributed to a decision to cut revenue guidance for the year.

The cable channel owner, whose properties include Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, has been aggressively expanding overseas in recent years. Its international operations recently became a bigger revenue driver than its U.S. business.

That trend continued in the most recent quarter. The company reported a 14% rise in revenue to $1.57 billion, as a 32% rise in international networks offset a 1% decline in domestic networks. In terms of profitability, the international networks showed a 25% rise in operating income before depreciation and amortization, while domestic networks were flat on that measure.

The company primarily blamed the domestic revenue decline on a difficult comparison with last year, when digital licensing revenue was robust. It also acknowledged that ratings were a problem at its networks. Among the three biggest channels that account for about 70% of the company몭s revenue, ratings are down for the season at TLC and Animal Planet, and have only recently begun to rebound after a tough summer at the flagship Discovery Channel.

The company몭s stock fell 6.6% in Tuesday Nasdaq trading to $33.31.

몮Improving our ratings is a top priority here in the U.S.,몯 Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav said, noting that the company had recently hired former longtime Disney executive Rich Ross as president of the Discovery Channel.

The company is also facing a soft market for last-minute advertising sales, known as the 몮scatter몯 market, particularly in the last month, Mr. Zaslav said. 몮There몭s no question that in the last month, things have slowed,몯 he said of advertising sales. 몮Our sense is it몭s a little more cautiousness about how to deploy capital.몯

In part for this reason, as well as negative foreign-currency effects and the impact of a coming ban on pay-TV advertising in Russia, the company lowered its revenue outlook for the year, saying it now expects to post revenue of $6.3 billion to $6.35 billion, compared with its previous estimate of $6.45 billion to $6.525 billion.

In July, Russia passed a law banning ads on pay-TV channels, effective Jan. 1. Discovery Communications, which has been in Russia for a long time with channels such as Discovery, Science and Animal Planet, says the rule change forced it to cut its revenue outlook by about $20 million. Executives emphasized that Russia brings in less than 2% of the company몭s global revenue.

Mr. Zaslav said that a further tightening of Russian pay-TV rules expected at the end of 2016, which would force a reduction of non-Russian-owned media to under 20%, 몮probably will happen,몯 though the company will be 몮optimistic if we can get a workaround.몯

Back home, Discovery said it signed a deal with Sony Corp. to be part of the online video-streaming service it plans to launch by year몭s end, becoming the second major media company after Viacom Inc. to do so. A Sony spokesman confirmed the deal, saying that it would share more details including which channels and how many channels at a later date.

Meanwhile, Mr. Zaslav continued to raise concerns about Comcast몭s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable, and that one distributor controlling so much of the buying power for cable networks could cause 몮a retraction of investment in content.몯

Overall, profit for the quarter rose to $280 million, or 41 cents a share, from $255 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.

Babs, Aretha, Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett Ride Timeless Tunes to the Top

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - From Barbra Streisand's "Partners" and Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga's "Cheek to Cheek" -- both of which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 -- to collections from Annie Lennox, Barry Manilow, Aretha Franklin, Bryan Adams, She & Him, Billy Childs and Bette Midler, the fourth quarter has brought a gold mine of cover albums featuring timeless copyrights presented in fresh ways.

That is a very good news for music publishers, for whom copyrights are the gift that keeps on giving. This holiday season's bounty is the most abundant anyone can remember in recent years -- the combination of well-known artists performing beloved songs provides perfect stocking-stuffer material.

While many of the compilations focus on tunes from the Great American Songbook -- the canon of standards written from the 1920s to the 1950s -- others, such as Franklin's salute to divas, Adams' "Tracks of My Years," and Childs' homage to Laura Nyro, highlight proven hits from the '60s, '70s and '80s, and even up to Adele's 2010 chartbuster, "Rolling in the Deep."

"It doesn't have to be 50 years old to feel like something classic," says Danny Strick, U.S. co-president of Sony/ATV. "When you hear Aretha singing 'Rolling in the Deep," it doesn't sound like a cover, it sounds like an Aretha classic."

Any time an older song is re-recorded, it has the potential to find a new audience and that is a proposition that always interests publishers.

"New versions are always compounding the value of the copyright," says Evan Lamberg, Universal Music Publishing Group's president, North America. "I couldn't tell you because (someone new) cut it the song is going to make another $10 million this year, but it just keeps it out in the atmosphere and keeps it fresh .... These albums build bridges that keep these songs timeless. That's the goal of any publisher."

Most of these artists attarct older demographics, but acts like Lady Gaga or She & Him's Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward can expose the song not only to new ears, but also to a new generation. "Lady Gaga is introducing these songs to a whole new audience," says Kathy Spanberger, peermusic's president and COO. "Some younger people may have never heard these songs."

For many of these projects, the artists already have specific songs in mind and it's a sweet surprise when the publishers realize their songs have been used -- the act only needs the copyright holder's permission if altering the song, such as changing lyrics or mashing it up with another tune.

But in some cases, the publisher can lobby a project. "The Cole Porter Trust was very eager to have Cole Porter's songs on the Tony Bennett/Lady Gaga album," says Sean Patrick Flahaven, Warner/Chappell Music's senior VP of theater and catalog development. "So we worked very hard on that. It was very gratifying to the estate, not only financially, but to bring that music out again." There are two Porter songs on "Cheek to Cheek."

Publishers push the catalog year round: they routinely send out compilations to mark a writer's birthday or death anniversary to remind A&R execs, music supervisors, video game manufacturers, ad agencies and other potential licensors of the copyrights available.

Other times, a television series designs its own reworking of a classic: Jamey Johnson, Shooter Jennings and Marilyn Manson guitarist Twiggy Ramirez totally upended peermusic's copyright "You Are My Sunshine" for a "Sons of Anarchy" episode last year. The haunting remake provoked enough interest that it was released as single. Another one of peermusic's recent successes was viral and radio hit "Cups." Originally featured in "Pitch Perfect," the song was based on A.P. Carter's "Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone."

Warner Chappell takes a proactive stance by asking its singer-songwriters when they are recording their albums if they would also record a catalog song for potential synch usage so the publisher has the song cleared and at the ready.

It's not uncommon, says Flahaven, to tell artists about an upcoming project and ask if they'd be willing to cut a Rodgers & Hart tune. "Then if it's placed, it makes up for the time and expense of recording it," says the Warner/Chappell exec. "We like to accumulate those in our pitching system in general."

While these cover projects undoubtedly help fill publishing companies' coffers, diminished sales -- no album released in 2014 has reached platinum -- and issues with streaming payments do not make them the treasure trove they once were. "It's the reality of the environment we are in," Spanberger says.

"Streaming money to publishers and writers is anemic (from) Pandora and Spotify. It's just hundredths of a cent compared to a performance on the radio or a mechanical. But there is an upside to having these songs exposed on the Internet."

There's a reason these classics remain relevant for any audience, says Jay Landers, executive producer of Streisand's "Partners": "The greatest songs from the golden era all the way up to the standards of today have a common thread, which is that they are truly crafted. They are songs with a beginning and middle and end and take the listener on a journey."

Landers questions whether many of today's rhythmic-dominated pop songs will turn into tomorrow's evergreens, but he is very sure of one thing: "I have no doubt that 'Over the Rainbow' will be sung forever."

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - With Christian Bale parting ways on the project, Sony has moved quickly to find the man to portray the late Apple founder Steve Jobs.               

Michael Fassbender is in early talks to play "Jobs" in the the Sony biopic that Danny Boyle is directing, sources confirm.               

Based on Walter Isaacson's biography "Steve Jobs," the real-life drama is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin.               

Seth Rogen is in talks to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Scott Rudin will produce along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.               

Sorkin has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple's famous product launches.               

"The first one being the Mac," he told the Daily Beast. "The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod."               

"It's a little like writing about the Beatles," he added. "There are so many people out there that know him and revere him."               

Leonardo DiCaprio had been circling the role but eventually passed to take time off from acting. David Fincher had also been in talks at one point to direct.               

Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul's death in 2011.

Activision몭s Revenue Jumps 78% on 몬Destiny,몭 Mobile Sales; Videogame Maker몭s Holiday Outlook, However, Falls Below Analyst Expectations

Activision Blizzard Inc. reported a better-than-expected revenue increase of 78% in the third quarter, boosted by the new sci-fi shooter game 몮Destiny몯 and continued growth in its mobile business.

Shares of the videogame maker, up more than 18% over the past 12 months, rose 3.6% in after-hours trading, despite issuing a fourth-quarter forecast that fell short of expectations.

The Santa Monica, Calif., company guided for earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $2.2 billion in the December quarter, compared with the Wall Street consensus of 94 cents a share on $2.34 billion in net revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.

New versions of popular titles 몮Skylanders,몯 몮Call of Duty몯 and 몮World of Warcraft몯 are expected this quarter. Ahead of the release, Activision reported a quarterly increase in 몮World of Warcraft몯 subscribers.

Also seen helping holiday results is continued sales of 몮Destiny,몯 which was released in September and represents the latest project by Bungie, the developer behind the popular 몮Halo몯 series.

Game developers like Activision have benefited from the latest generation of videogame consoles, Sony Corp.몭s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Corp.몭s Xbox One, both released last year. In the latest period, Activision reported next-gen consoles accounted for $468 million, or 40% of net revenue.

Activision, which like its peers once relied on sales of videogames stored on discs, has been shifting to digital downloads and customizing game offerings to specific markets. For example, Chief Executive Bobby Kotick said the company has a special version of 몮Call of Duty Online몯 for China.

For the most recently completed period, digital downloads accounted for 67% of total revenue, up from 59% a year earlier.

Overall, Activision reported a loss of $23 million, or three cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $56 million, or five cents a share. Excluding changes in deferred revenue and other items, Activision몭s per-share earnings rose to 23 cents from eight cents a year earlier.

Gaming companies spread out revenue for games with online components over the life of the subscription instead of at the time of sale.

Net revenue, adjusting for such deferred revenue and other nonrecurring items, was $1.17 billion. Mobile-related revenue rose 27% to $505 million.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a profit of 13 cents a share on $1.01 billion revenue.

Apple, Google Set Disney Video Deal; Tech Giants Will Allow Movie Buyers to Watch on Devices Running Rival몭s OS

Walt Disney Co. has achieved something that many in Hollywood멪and Silicon Valley멪have been attempting for years: Getting Apple Inc. and Google Inc. to play nicely together.

In an unprecedented agreement to share rights to digital content, the two tech giants will allow consumers who buy a Disney movie from either of their online stores to watch it on smartphones, tablets and other digital devices that run their rival몭s operating system.

Starting Tuesday people who register with the Disney Movies Anywhere app and buy a copy of 몮Frozen몯 from the Google Play store on an Android tablet, for instance, can later watch the film on an Apple TV through their iTunes library.

Until now, Apple has restricted movies, TV shows and other content to its own family of iOS devices, along with Mac or Windows computers. Google placed similar restriction on its digital store and Android-powered devices.

Such a strategy can help to lock consumers into one hardware company, but Hollywood studios have long argued that it makes people wary of buying digital movies because they must worry that if they buy a different device, their film library will disappear. DVDs, by contrast, work on players built by any manufacturer.

Both Apple and Google will pay Disney a wholesale rate for each copy of a film that they sell and keep any profits, regardless of the devices on which people watch.

몮This is about getting people comfortable with building their digital movies collection,몯 said Jamie Voris, chief technology officer at Walt Disney Studios. 몮Disney is going to protect them and make sure they can watch their movies wherever they want to.몯

The deal is particularly notable because every major Hollywood studio save for Disney is part of a coalition called Ultraviolet that, like Disney Movies Anywhere, is designed to let people build a library of movies online without worrying about restrictions on the devices they can use to watch.

Ultraviolet launched in late 2011, more than two years before Disney Movies Anywhere. Yet the backers of Ultraviolet, which include Time Warner Inc.몭s Warner Bros. and Sony Corp.몭s Sony Pictures Entertainment, have been unable to persuade Apple to join Ultraviolet. Though its market share has been falling, Apple still controls 61% of online movie sales, according to research firm IHS.

Google, which is also not part of Ultraviolet, accounted for 7% of U.S. online movie sales in the first half of 2014.

몮The approach Ultraviolet has taken relative to the approach Disney Movies Anywhere has taken is slightly different,몯 said Jonathan Zepp, head of Google Play Movies partnerships. 몮[Disney몭s] was the one we felt was the right path for us to move forward with right now.몯

Asked whether other movies from studios were likely to become available for similar sharing between Google and Apple devices, Mr. Zepp called such a proposition 몮philosophically interesting.몯

The agreement applies to Disney movies purchased online and digital copies that come with Blu-ray discs.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

Disney and Apple have had close corporate ties since the media giant몭s 2006 acquisition of Pixar Animation Studios, which at the time was controlled by Apple몭s then-chief, Steve Jobs. Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger is on Apple몭s board and a trust controlled by Mr. Jobs몭 widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, is the largest shareholder of Disney, with a 7.5% stake.

Mark Teitell, general manager of Ultraviolet, noted that apps from companies that are part of his coalition, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.몭s Vudu, are usable on Apple and Android devices.

몮We tend to look at what a consumer can do with six major studios몭 titles,몯 Mr Teitell said.

With Apple and Google, Disney Movies Anywhere now works with retailers that account for more than two-thirds of digital movie sales. Ultraviolet works with stores that account for less than 12%.

Amazon.com Inc., which made up almost 9% of digital movie sales in the first half of this year, is in talks with several studios to join Ultraviolet, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.

Though it releases fewer movies than other major studios, Disney is a powerhouse in the home video market because its family-entertainment titles are more frequently purchased so that young children can watch them repeatedly.

Disney Movies Anywhere launched in February, but worked only with Apple몭s iTunes at the time. A version of the app for Android devices launches Tuesday. Despite the expanded usage rights under the Disney deal, the economics of digital movie sales will remain the same, a knowledgeable person said.

Asian Shares Mixed, But Japan몭s Nikkei Reaches Seven-Year High; Tokyo몭s Nikkei Up 3.5% in 2014 and at Highest Since October 2007

Tokyo stocks rose 2.7% to a seven-year high Tuesday, bringing gains to 7.7% since the Bank of Japan몭s surprise decision Friday to expand easing measures, with a stronger dollar powering buying.

After breaking into positive territory Friday, the Nikkei Stock Average is up 3.5% for the year and trading at its highest level since October 2007. The market was closed Monday for a national holiday.

The dollar was at ?113.66 late in Asia, well up from ?109.22 Thursday, before the Bank of Japan몭s move.

Japanese exporters were among the big gainers on the Nikkei. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. was up 9.6%, Sony Corp. rose 9.0% and Panasonic Corp. was up 4.0%.

In Korea, the Kospi fell 1.0% to 1935.19 as Korean exporters such as auto and electronics goods makers declined on worries that rivals in Japan will have a pricing edge in global markets. The index is down 3.8% this year and is the worst performing among major indexes in the region.

Hyundai Motor Co. lost 3.5% and Kia Motors was down 0.6%, after the companies agreed to pay a combined fine of $100 million and forfeit regulatory credits valued at $200 million to settle charges they overstated the fuel economy of vehicles sold in the U.S.

Markets elsewhere in the region were mixed.

The Shanghai Composite Index was flat at 2430.68 and Hong Kong몭s Hang Seng Index was down 0.3% at 23845.66. HSBC was down 0.5% in Hong Kong after it released weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter late Monday. The bank is the biggest component stock on the Hang Seng Index.

Japan몭s central bank took markets by surprise Friday as it increased its buying of government bonds to ?80 trillion (around $700 billion) annually from ?60 trillion-?70 trillion. The $1.1 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund also said Friday it would boost its domestic stock allocation to 25% from 12%.

몮Another 15% appreciation in stocks from Friday몭s close to the end of 2014 isn몭t out of the question,몯 said CLSA equity strategist Nicholas Smith.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Music rally can shake off discordant Taylor Swift

By Jeffrey Goldfarb

NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Back in 1989, the year Taylor Swift was born and the title of her latest hit album, Garth Brooks sold over 10 million copies of his eponymous record. It is a bygone era for the music industry. Until Swift released the collection that includes "Shake It Off" last week, no artist had sold even 1 million this year. That sort of popularity gives her the market power to make decisions like the one she did on Monday to pull her catalog from digital streaming service Spotify.

The Swedish company was eager to get back together with her. It said on its blog that about four out of every 10 users had played Swift's songs in the last 30 days and that she was on 19 million playlists. In truth, though, a music rebound can happen even if the mega-star never comes around to the subscription idea.

The economics of the $15 billion industry have changed too dramatically. Global recorded music revenue tumbled by another 3.9 percent last year, dragged down by an unexpected collapse in Japan. Meanwhile, sales from services like Spotify increased by over 50 percent and surpassed the $1 billion mark - from zero not so long ago. In the first half of this year, paid streaming revenue surged in the United States, Japan and big European markets like Germany and France. Credit Suisse analysts reckon total sales will actually grow in 2016.

Artists may earn less than a penny per play, but Spotify argues that it's better for all of them if consumers are paying rather than stealing. And for the companies behind the music - especially the three giants, Vivendi's Universal, Sony and Warner Music - the profit margins are better than for CDs and probably even downloading. A customer who shells out $120 a year for an annual Spotify subscription exceeds the $50 or so an average digital downloader spends, according to industry trade group BPI.

Consumers also are getting used to the idea of having access to a big slug of the world's music library. Apple's acquisition of the Beats music service could accelerate the appeal, given its 800 million iTunes accounts. There's no mistaking that a music industry slowly bouncing back will depend on superstars like Taylor Swift, but it's also never going back to 1989.

              
              
              
              
CONTEXT NEWS

              


- Spotify said on its blog site on Nov. 3 that it hopes Taylor Swift will "change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone," following media reports that the pop star had pulled her music from the digital streaming service. Spotify said nearly 16 million of its users had played her songs in the last 30 days and that she was on 19 million playlists.

A Hamster몭s Take on His Bratty Owner; Simon Rich on Ripping Off Heroes, Bombing a 몬30 Rock몭 Audition and His Inability to Learn From Success

몮Spoiled Brats,몯 a new collection of short stories by Simon Rich, begins with a tale narrated by a class hamster about the casual sadism of a school kid named Simon Rich. In another story, a hard-working immigrant emerges from a pickle vat after spending a century preserved in brine, only to encounter his self-indulged great-great grandson, also named Simon Rich.

The 30-year-old comedy writer doesn몭t just take aim at himself in this book, his sixth, but at mothers who think their little monsters are gifted and fathers who몭d rather die than get overtaken by their sons. (Literally멪that mother몭s child has horns, and that father asks his son to club him to death after losing at Scrabble.)

Mr. Rich found success early, nabbing a two-book deal before graduating from Harvard. Just out of college, he became one of the youngest writers in the history of 몮Saturday Night Live,몯 where he worked from 2007 to 2011.

He has been spending this fall in Toronto shooting 몮Man Seeking Woman,몯 starring Jay Baruchel, set to premiere on FXX next year. Mr. Rich is a writer on the cable series, which is based on his 2013 short-story collection, 몮The Last Girlfriend on Earth.몯 And he just finished the first draft of the screenplay based on the story of the pickled immigrant at the center of 몮Spoiled Brats몯; Sony Pictures acquired the movie rights to the piece, 몮Sell Out,몯 after it appeared in the New Yorker.

Mr. Rich, whose father is former New York Times writer Frank Rich, lives in Brooklyn with his wife and fellow writer, Kathleen Hale. He spoke with the Journal about ripping off his heroes, his inability to learn from success, and the time he bombed an audition for a character based on himself. An edited transcript follows.

You몭ve chosen some unusual narrators in your writing.

In my last book, I wanted to write a story about all the fear and anxiety that goes into losing one몭s virginity, and so I wrote it from the perspective of a condom in a teenage boy몭s wallet as he waited and waited to get used. That몭s always been my favorite way to tell a story, to start with a subject that몭s universal and hopefully emotionally relatable, and come at it from a brand new angle.

How did it occur to you to write a story from a hamster몭s point of view?

That몭s a very self-loathing, autobiographical story. It몭s about my own experiences being a spoiled, obnoxious 8-year-old boy, and I thought the funniest angle and the highest-stakes angle to tell that story from would be from the perspective of a creature I was actively hurting.

Have you given much thought to where your humor comes from?

The clich? is that all comedy writers were picked on and miserable and had miserable childhoods and are compensating for some kind of childhood trauma, but I don몭t think that몭s always true.

I know a lot of extremely funny writers who have incredibly boring upbringings. I also know a lot of people who have had horrible childhoods who are some of the most miserable, unfunny people you몭ve ever met.

For me, I think it just comes from loving jokes. The reason I got into this career is just because I wanted to rip off my heroes. I grew up obsessing over 몮The Simpsons몯 and reading Mad magazine and reading Philip Roth and P.G. Wodehouse and Evelyn Waugh and Joe Heller and reading Matt Groening comic books and just thinking, man, wouldn몭t it be great to just live in this world all the time?

How did you handle it at 몮SNL몯 when a piece you몭d written bombed?

I found personally that as a writer멪and this is true of story writing and novel writing and screenplay writing and sketch writing멪it몭s almost impossible for me to reverse-engineer any of my successes. I can몭t sit down and say, 몮Oh, this short story really worked, I몭m going to write one like that.몯 I몭m not really ever able to learn from my successes, but I몭ve always been able to learn from my failures.

So when you were writing for that show, you could figure out what went wrong right away?

Oh yeah, because sometimes the audience will go, 몮Oooh.몯 Or they몭ll sigh or they몭ll chuckle instead of laugh, or physically you look over and see them get confused or lose focus. You can tell. I often wish when I write a book that I could watch people몭s eyes as they몭re scrolling through the page.

What몭s it like to watch a stranger read one of your New Yorker stories on the subway?

I stare at them the whole time. If they make it through the end of the article, then I몭ll feel like I몭ve succeeded, and if they flip to another page, I몭m devastated.

Have you ever wanted to act in one of your comedies?

I always tell the story, to explain how bad of an actor I am, which is when I was writing for 몮SNL,몯 some friends of mine who wrote for 몮30 Rock몯 based a character on me. They called me downstairs to audition, and I did such a bad job I wasn몭t even called back for the role.

What was the role?

It was Tina Fey몭s agent, who I think was named Simon in the draft.

Did you perform in any 몮SNL몯 sketches?

As a sight gag. You can usually find me in some embarrassing, dehumanizing role. I was a white Harlem Globetrotter. I was an emaciated Incredible Hulk. More of a prop than an actor.

Christian Bale Drops Out of Steve Jobs Biopic

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - After early discussions to play the Apple founder, Christian Bale has decided to part ways with the Steve Jobs biopic at Sony.               

While negotiations were never fully under way, sources tell Variety that Bale had talks with director Danny Boyle about taking on the role, but a deal never came to fruition. The news comes almost two weeks after the biopic's screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, told Bloomberg that Bale was a lock for the part of Jobs. ""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that's Chris Bale," he said. "It's an extremely difficult part and he's gonna crush it."               

Sony will now look to find its replacement after Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio both passed on the part. The studio is in discussions with Seth Rogen to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.               

Scott Rudin, Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady are producing.

몬Nightcrawler몭 Neck-and-Neck With 몬Ouija몭 at Box Office

In a scary close finish, the Jake Gyllenhaal crime thriller 몮Nightcrawler몯 and the board-game adaptation 몮Ouija몯 tied for first at the box office with $10.9 million each over the Halloween weekend.

That was according to estimates Sunday from each film's distributor. Studios can predict a film몭s Sunday performance with fairly accurate precision. When final figures are announced on Monday, one film will likely slightly edge out the other.

For Open Road몭s low-budget Los Angeles noir 몮Nightcrawler,몯 it was a strong debut considering its creepy, unconventional protagonist. Mr. Gyllenhaal plays an ambulance-chasing man who shoots gory footage for the local news.

The independent, R-rated film was able to capitalize on a weekend that frightened away many studios. With Halloween falling on a Friday, trick-or-treating cannibalized one of the most lucrative moviegoing nights of the week. Grosses were down 40% on Friday from the same weekend a year ago, according to box-office tracker Rentrak.

Open Road몭s estimate for 몮Nightcrawler몯 was technically $8,760 above Universal몭s number for 몮Ouija.몯 But that tiny margin may not hold up when receipts from Sunday are counted. Other studios had 몮Ouija몯 as narrowly edging 몮Nightcrawler.몯

몮We몭ve seen squeakers over the years but this is one of the closest ones I몭ve ever seen,몯 said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Rentrak. 몮It몭s a testament to the holding power of 몬Ouija.몭몯

Despite the Halloween night impact, 몮Ouija몯 dropped only 45% after topping the box office last weekend. That몭s unusually low for a micro-budget horror film, most of which see interest wane considerably after opening. But Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures opened the horror film a weekend ahead of Halloween to give it a two-week window.

The close contest added drama to one of the quietest movie weekends of the year. Overall business was down 25% from the prior year. Said Mr. Dergarabedian: 몮The scariest thing about this weekend was that Halloween fell on a Friday.몯

Next weekend will be a far different story, though, with the highly anticipated release of Christopher Nolan몭s science-fiction epic 몮Interstellar,몯 as well as Walt Disney Co.몭s animated superhero film 몮Big Hero 6.몯

In the meantime, the World War II tale 몮Fury몯 from Sony Corp.몭s Columbia Pictures held in third place with $9.1 million in its third week of release. In its fifth week, the Twentieth Century Fox thriller 몮Gone Girl몯 also remained in fourth with an additional $8.8 million to its $136.6 million cumulative total to make it the highest-grossing release of director David Fincher몭s career.

Twentieth Century Fox parent 21st Century Fox was until last year part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - "Nightcrawler," a dark crime thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a cameraman in the high-speed world of siren-chasing journalism, topped sluggish weekend domestic box office charts with $10.9 million in ticket sales.

"Ouija," last weekend's box office leader, was second by a razor-thin margin, selling just $8,760 fewer in tickets in a weekend slowed by candy-gathering Halloween trick-or-treaters and revelers, according to estimates from tracking firm Rentrak.

The World War Two war film "Fury" was third with $9.1 million for the three days from Friday through Sunday in the United States and Canada.

The moves in Tokyo sparked a world-wide stock rally, pushing the Dow and S&P 500 to record highs and driving the yen sharply lower.

U.S. employers몭 compensation costs increased in the past two quarters at their fastest pace since 2008.

Exxon and Chevron posted surprising profit growth, fortified against oil-price swings by strength in refining.

Russia몭s central bank raised interest rates sharply by 1.5 percentage points, seeking to slow inflation and shore up the sagging ruble.

J.P. Morgan discovered it was hit by a massive cyberattack in part because of a foot race the bank sponsors.

U.S. regulators disclosed a new air-bag recall involving Infiniti vehicles, raising deeper quality-control concerns.

Banks must hold enough cash to cover expected outflows over a one-year horizon, global regulators said.

Sony posted another hefty loss, but strong PlayStation 4 sales added a bright note.

 Sony  Posts Hefty Loss, but With Glimmers of Hope;  Sony  Reports $1.2 Billion Loss After Smartphone Business Write-Down; PlayStation 4 Sells Well

TOKYO멪Sony Corp. investors have suffered through years of losses, but the latest massive one, reported Friday, contained a bit of good news for the Japanese electronics and entertainment giant.

Booming sales of its PlayStation 4 videogame console and of camera sensors for smartphones offset weakness in the company몭s own mobile division, resulting in a less-than-expected net loss of ?136 billion ($1.22 billion) for the summer quarter.

Without a previously announced ?176 billion write-down of the value of its mobile business, Sony would have posted a profit, the company said. As a result, even some Sony executives were broaching the possibility that the company might have finally hit bottom.

몮Excluding one-time effects, we have gradually started to make profits,몯 said Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony몭s chief financial officer, at a news conference in Tokyo.

Sales in the videogame business surged 83%, and the division recorded an operating profit of ?21.8 billion, reversing a year-earlier loss. The PlayStation 4, released less than a year ago, sold at a record pace in August. Sony몭s devices unit, which supplies Apple Inc. and other smartphone makers with image sensors, posted an operating profit of ?29.6 billion, more than double the year-earlier level. Ahead of the holiday-shopping season, both units raised their full-year revenue forecasts.

Even Sony몭s television unit, which has been losing money for much of the last decade, logged an operating profit멪marking its first back-to-back quarters in the black since fiscal 2003. Sony has said it expects the unit to be profitable for the full financial year ending in March. Sony몭s overall sales rose 7%, to ?1.9 trillion yen, in the quarter.

To be sure, no one is celebrating yet. Over the last decade, Sony has repeatedly offered hints of a possible turnaround, only to dash hopes with a renewed slump. The latest worry is the weakness of the Japanese currency, which plunged against the dollar Friday after the Bank of Japan surprised the markets with monetary-easing measures. Mr. Yoshida said every decline of one yen against the dollar costs Sony ?3 billion in losses.

Sony also needs to fix the smartphone business, which the company only a year ago said was a pillar of its turnaround strategy. Since then the business has been hit by severe competition from inexpensive Chinese handset markets. The segment showed an operating loss of ?172 billion in the July-September quarter, largely due to the charge to write down the business.

On Thursday, Sony named a new head of its mobile division, Hiroki Totoki, who is seen as a close ally of Mr. Yoshida. The chief financial officer has stepped up restructuring and cost-cutting efforts since being named to that post earlier this year.

Mr. Yoshida said Friday that Sony would scale back its smartphone business in China, the world몭s biggest mobile market, by giving up on sales of low-end handsets that compete with domestic makers. Mr. Yoshida said the board was considering shrinking in other emerging countries, but declined to specify.

The decision to reduce its handset offerings in China led Sony to revise downward its sales target for Xperia smartphones for the full year ending in March, to 41 million units from 43 million. That was the second cut to Sony몭s smartphone forecast this year; initially the company predicted sales of 50 million smartphones, up from 39.1 million in the previous fiscal year. Most analysts said at the time that the projection was unrealistic.

몮We had debated whether it would be right to shrink our presence in the world몭s largest smartphone market, but have judged what we need to do right now is to rebuild the business structure,몯 Mr. Yoshida said.

Analysts say the fortunes of Sony몭s smartphones now depend on the U.S. market. They are hopeful that Mr. Totoki, who was a start-up member of Sony몭s banking unit, would be able to build stronger relationships with U.S. mobile carriers, which have sometimes been reluctant to carry Sony smartphones, and to make the business more efficient.

몮With his experience of setting up and running a bank, I몭m confident Mr. Totoki can establish a relationship of trust with carriers,몯 said Atsushi Osanai, a former Sony product strategist who now teaches at Tokyo-based Waseda Business School.

Mr. Totoki said he is proud of the company몭s smartphones and wants to turn the mobile division into a star performer once again. But some Sony watchers are wary, saying more radical measures than the 15% personnel reduction that Sony has announced for the division may be necessary.

몮We could be told it will cost more and take longer for Sony to finish the mobile unit restructuring,몯 said Yasuo Nakane, an analyst for Deutsche Securities.

Emma Watson, Judi Dench, Robert Downey Jr. Honored at Britannia Awards

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - British royalty mingled with Hollywood royalty at the Britannia Awards on Thursday night at the Beverly Hilton.

Taped messages from J.K. Rowling and Prince William were sent to the guests while Judi Dench, who has played Queen Elizabeth on the big and small screen was among the honorees.

Rowling sent her wishes to Emma Watson, the night's first honoree. "I'm so glad she wanted to act (after 'Harry Potter') because it means we didn't spoil it for her."

Watson, who grew up on the "Harry Potter" film franchise described how her pet died during filming of the third movie. "The set decorators made a tiny coffin for my hamster," she said. "The British film industry is not just an industry but also a family where I grew up."

By the time honorees Judi Dench, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. were introduced the presenters got a little more raw in their speeches. Dustin Hoffman called Dench "the sexiest broad with the lustiest laugh."

Dench regaled audiences with stories about how a top producer told her she would never make it in film "because my face was not arranged properly." While the Albert Cubby Broccoli honoree had never met the filmmaker, she said she "owed Cubby Broccoli for all the Bond films. I had a sensational time making the films."

Downey was introduced by Jamie Foxx and Jon Favreau. Foxx said when he first met Downey the honoree said he wanted a house. "I thought he should at least have a career," Foxx said, adding, "When he started to play black people, I started to get nervous."

"Sometimes I just can't get enough of myself," Downey said in his acceptance speech. "It's ugly."

Then Downey had his wife, Susan, stand up so the guests could she how pregnant she was. Describing this second pregnancy as rather difficult on him, he said he was on bed rest.

Armando Iannucci presented Louis-Dreyfus's award and deadpanned, "Comedy is many things but we can all agree it's not drama. That's why there's only one comedy actor honored here among so many actors."

Louis-Dreyfus was remarkable, he said, because "she's got five Emmys, which is equal to one BAFTA. Not only is she funny, shockingly for a woman, but thanks to her efforts we have four comediennes now."

Louis-Dreyfus said knowing she was a winner already was a big help. "There's no anxiety, I don't have to put on your 'I'm so happy Lena Dunham won' face." Pretending to stumble through her acceptance speech till Iannucci gave her a sheet, she breezed through it in a non-regional English accent.

Humanitarian honoree Ruffalo, who was presented his award for his work with Water Defense by Josh Gad, said, "Wow, I was convinced I wasn't going to get this tonight," before turning serious about the need for clean water. "Our entire existence is wrapped up in water, we need it."

Director Mike Leigh was introduced by fellow helmer Jim Sheridan. "I hate Mike Leigh, everytime I make a depressing movie, he makes a really depressing movie and wins awards," Sheridan joked.

Leigh said he wasn't going to thank anyone but then gave a shout-out to Sony Pictures Classics co-toppers Michael Barker and Tom Bernard. "I made 19 films without scripts," he said.

The evening was hosted by Rob Brydon, introducing himself as Renee Zellweger, and got huge laughs talking about the Scottish vote for independence. "Trust a Scotsman never to pull out when he says he will."

TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp  reported a second-quarter operating loss on Friday that was narrower than analysts had estimated, as blockbuster sales of its PlayStation 4 games console reduced the impact of a sluggish smartphone division.               

Operating loss reached 85.6 billion yen ($771 million) in July-September, compared with the 164.3 billion yen average estimate of 3 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. In the same quarter last year, Sony booked a profit of 14.8 billion yen.               

The company posted a net loss of 136 billion yen for the quarter and held its full-year net loss forecast at 230 billion yen.               

Sony also lowered its smartphone sales outlook to 41 million handsets from 43 million, compared with 39 million last year.

Seth Rogen to Play Apple Co-Founder Wozniak in Steve Jobs Biopic

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Seth Rogen has been set to star as Steve Wozniak opposite Christian Bale in Sony's Steve Jobs biopic, sources confirm.

Variety reported on Oct. 15 that Bale was in talks to star in "Jobs," Sony's biopic about the late Apple co-founder. Writer Aaron Sorkin recently confirmed the Bale casting.

Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role.

Based on Walter Isaacson's biography "Steve Jobs," the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle.

Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.

Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama "The Social Network," has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple's famous product launches.

Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul's death in 2011.

Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987.

Last year's independently financed "Jobs" starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched. Worldwide box office was modest at $36 million.

Rogen starred this year in Universal's "Neighbors" and will be seen next with James Franco in Sony's "The Interview."

He is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.

By Soham Chatterjee

Oct 30 (Reuters) - GoPro Inc forecast better-than-expected holiday quarter sales, underscoring the increasing popularity of its wearable cameras among surfers, skydivers and other action junkies.

GoPro's shares, which went public in June, shot up 14 percent in extended trading on Thursday after the company also reported strong third-quarter results.

Videos taken using GoPro cameras, which can be mounted on helmets, boards, bikes and dog harnesses, have made a big splash on the Internet.

YouTube videos such as "Run Walter, RUN!!", "Waltz On The Walls of City Hall" and "Golf Trick Shot" have gone viral, helping GoPro's cameras gain popularity beyond sports and outdoor enthusiasts.

"The social media side of the business had great metrics, with YouTube content up 92 percent year-over-year (in the third quarter) and YouTube views up 99 percent," Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Reuters.

"All this indicates growing brand awareness, and bodes well for a successful holiday," Pachter said.

The California-based company launched the latest version of its flagship Hero4 camera and a cheap entry-level camera in September, targeting holiday shoppers.

"We anticipate particular strength in our direct channel both with our big box and midmarket customers," Chief Financial Officer Jack Lazar said on a conference call.

The company said it expects a profit of 65-69 cents per share on sales of $550-$580 million for the fourth quarter ending December.

Analysts were expecting a profit of 55 cents per share on revenue of $505.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

GoPro dominates the action camera market, with analysts estimating a market share of more than 90 percent.

The resounding success of its cameras has prompted several companies such as Sony Corp, Garmin Ltd and Panasonic Corp to launch their own offerings.

According to NPD Group's Retail Tracking Service, GoPro was the top-selling camcorder in the United States in 2013.

FIRST-QUARTER BEAT

GoPro reported an adjusted profit of 12 cents per share for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, topping the average analyst estimate of 8 cents.

Revenue rose about 46 percent to $280 million. Analysts on average had expected $265.6 million.

The net income attributable to GoPro shareholders was $14.6 million, or 10 cents per share, in the third quarter compared with a loss of $1.1 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier.

The company's shares were trading at $73.33 after the bell. The stock has more than doubled since its market debut in June. (Reporting by Soham Chatterjee in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)

World
Taiwan몭s Economy Gains Momentum; Taiwan몭s Economy Records Best Quarter in Almost Two Years, Boosted By Tourism, Electronic Exports

TAIPEI멪Taiwan몭s economy logged its best quarter in almost two years, as higher income from electronic exports and tourist arrivals filtered through to the rest of the economy.

In the three months ended Sept. 30, Taiwan몭s gross domestic product rose 3.78% from the same period a year earlier and was up 0.49% from the previous quarter, an initial reading by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics showed Friday. This was the highest pace of expansion, since the economy recorded GDP growth of 3.85% in the fourth quarter of 2012.

On a year-over-year basis, growth was largely in line with the government몭s previous estimate of 3.62% and the median 3.85% increase forecast by 10 economists in a survey by The Wall Street Journal. The economy expanded 3.74% in the previous quarter.

Taiwanese manufacturers are supplying key components such as microprocessors and camera lenses to global electronics brands such as Apple Inc. and Sony Corp. Near-record overseas sales of semiconductors for iPhones, continued but modest recovery in key overseas markets, particularly the U.S., and strong growth in income from tourism boosted Taiwan몭s overall exports by 6.68% in the third quarter from a year earlier. That was faster than a 2.88% growth in the second quarter.

Economists say strong demand for new iPhones and the global rollout of faster fourth-generation mobile networks will continue to buoy demand for Taiwanese-made electronic components in the fourth quarter.

According to the Tourism Bureau, 7.25 million people visited Taiwan during the first nine months of this year, up 25% from a year earlier. China was the largest source of tourists, with 2.96 million people visiting, up 36% from a year earlier.

Barclays Research predicts Taiwan몭s GDP will grow 4.10% this year, better than the government몭s target of 3.41%, citing rising income from tourism. But it will still be way below the plus-5% expansion it regularly reported before the global financial crisis.

Capital formation, which includes government and private-sector investment in fixed assets and changes in inventories, gained 7.89% in the third quarter, after rising 6.9% in the second quarter.

An improving job market also lifted private consumption by 2.43% in the third quarter, although it was slower than a 2.53% rise in the second quarter. The government said the gain was partly offset by a drop in sales at restaurants since an adulterated cooking-oil scandal broke in early September.

Samsung, LG turn to quantum dots as OLED still too pricey

SEOUL, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The world's biggest TV makers, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and LG Electronics Inc , are turning to quantum dot technology for their next-generation TVs as it could still be years before OLED is affordable for the mass market.

The nascent technology involves incorporating a film of tiny light-emitting crystals into regular liquid crystal displays (LCD). The manufacturing process is relatively straightforward and offers improved picture quality at much cheaper cost than using organic light-emitting diodes (OLED).

The resulting lower prices could help the technology catch on far quicker. One industry analyst estimated a 55-inch quantum dot TV could be priced 30 to 35 percent more than a current LCD TV, while an OLED TV could be 5 times more expensive. LG recently launched a 65-inch ultra-high definition OLED TV for 12 million won ($11,350) in its home market of South Korea.

The only real challenge is securing enough quantum dot material from the small pool of suppliers, including Quantum Materials Corp and Nanoco Group PLC.

Nanoco last month said a South Korean plant being built by partner Dow Chemical Co will start quantum dot production in the first half of 2015. Analysts believe the output is destined for a local client.

On Wednesday, LG, the world's No.2 TV maker after domestic rival Samsung, said it plans to make quantum dot TVs in addition to OLED TVs. Analysts regarded that a tacit acknowledgement that OLED needs more time for prices to come down before becoming the new standard.

"We are pursuing a dual-track strategy with quantum dot and OLED," LG Chief Financial Officer Jung Do-hyun told analysts after the company reported earnings. OLED is the fundamentally superior product, he said.

Samsung Vice President Simon Sung told analysts on Thursday that quantum dot is among many technologies under consideration.

"How a technology will match with market conditions, when a technology will emerge as the main market segment is the most critical consideration," Sung said. "We'll respond aggressively after identifying such a market opportunity."

At present, Japan's Sony Corp is the only major electronics manufacturer selling quantum dot TVs. Last month, China's TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings Ltd unveiled a quantum dot TV at the IFA tech expo in Berlin.

OLED RISK

LG and affiliate LG Display Co Ltd are the biggest champions of OLED TVs, in contrast to Samsung which has not released a model this year. Analysts say the lack of Samsung support could limit OLED growth prospects and keep prices high.

"In theory, OLED should become cheaper than LCD once production yields get better because OLED doesn't need a backlight, but at this point both the scale and production yield remain low," said CIMB analyst Lee Do-hoon.

"LG needs a product in the interim, and they seem to be saying they'll look at market conditions and respond with quantum dot," Lee said.

Samsung could be more aggressive than LG in pushing quantum dot as Korea's No.1 consumer electronics maker appears less committed to a particular technology, analysts said. LG, on the other hand, risks undermining its OLED push.

"If LG focuses on quantum dot, it'd be basically the same as signalling that it will be difficult for OLED to go mainstream in the near term," said CIMB's Lee.

Researcher DisplaySearch forecasts 1.95 million quantum dot TV shipments next year, for just 0.8 percent of the market, growing to 25.5 million by 2020. IHS Technology sees OLED TV shipments at 7.8 million units by 2019 from 600,000 in 2015.

Some analysts question how successful quantum dot TVs will be given the availability of affordable LCD TVs, including ultra-high definition sets that they say offer enough bang for the buck.

"The main lineup for TVs is still LCD TV, so I don't know how much quantum dot matters," said HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh. "I don't think it would signify anything more than bolstering the product lineup."

(The Day Ahead is an email and PDF publication that includes the day's major stories and events, analyses and other features. To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) Oil companies and Dow components Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are due to report their third-quarter results, which are expected to reflect a drop in the price of crude oil. Investors will look for updates on Exxon's projects in Russia, where sanctions have stalled some operations, and learn if the timetables for new projects aimed at growing oil and gas output are intact. Wall Street analysts are expected to grill Chevron executives on the status of delayed growth projects. U.S. consumer spending likely closed the third quarter on a soft note, setting up for a somewhat weaker fourth quarter. Economists expect the Commerce Department to report that consumer spending rose just 0.1 percent in September (0830/1230).

 Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (0945/1345) and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment data are also scheduled for release (0955/1355). Drugmaker AbbVie Inc, which earlier this month abandoned its $55 billion tax-inversion deal to buy Dublin drugmaker Shire, is expected to report sharply higher third-quarter sales as growth of its Humira arthritis drug offset the impact of falling sales of many of its other products. The company's dependence on Humira will underscore its need to pursue other deals in order to replenish its pipeline of experimental drugs. Third-quarter results from Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, the world's biggest beer maker, may seem a little flat after a boost from the soccer World Cup in the second quarter. However, sales declines are likely in Brazil, its second-largest market. Japan's Sony Corp reports results for the July-September quarter. After announcing a massive writedown on its mobile unit in September, the company is expected to cut the sales forecast for its Xperia smartphones. The company is also expected to report the progress on a restructuring program, under which it will cut 1,000 jobs by March 2015. Timber conglomerate Weyerhaeuser Co, which manages 20 million acres of forests, is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit. The company, in its second-quarter earnings release in August, said third-quarter results will include a net gain of about $1 billion on the divestiture of its home building and real estate company WRECO. However, Weyerhaeuser is expected to report lower third-quarter revenue, hurt by lower realizations from lumber and oriented strand board. Cleaning products maker Clorox Inc will report its first-quarter results before the bell. The company said last month that its chief executive of eight years, Donald Knauss, was stepping down, and days later announced it was exiting Venezuela as the business was "no longer viable." Clorox has missed the Street's profit estimates in the past four quarters. Oshkosh Corp, a manufacturer of specialty trucks and construction equipment, is expected to report a higher fourth-quarter profit as increased sales to builders offsets the impact of a continued decline in sales to military customers. Statistics Canada releases gross domestic product data for August. Analysts expect the real gross domestic product to be unchanged from July (0830/1230). Mexico's central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate and argue that a recent spike in inflation will fade next year. Fifteen analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the bank to leave its main interest rate unchanged at 3 percent while one analyst expected a 25-basis-point cut after weak growth in the third quarter. Separately, Brazil's central bank releases its monthly report on the federal budget. The primary balance is a gauge closely watched by investors because it measures a country's ability to service its debt (0830/1230).

TOKYO--Sony Corp. on Thursday named Senior Vice President Hiroki Totoki as the new head of its mobile division, the electronics giant몭s latest move to prop up its struggling smartphone business.

Mr. Totoki, who once led Sony Bank, part of the company몭s financial arm, as well as the Sony몭s Internet-service provider business So-net, will replace the current head of Sony Mobile Communications, Kunimasa Suzuki, on Nov. 16. Mr. Suzuki will become an executive vice president of Sony Entertainment, which oversees the conglomerate몭s music, movie and publication segments.

몮In light of the global mobile market that is rapidly becoming competitive and difficult, we need to make our business profitable,몯 a spokeswoman at Sony said. 몮Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai judged Mr. Totoki, who has a proven track of record in turning the business profitable, is the most suited for the job.몯

Sony posted a net profit in the April-June quarter despite the unprofitable smartphone business, thanks to its financial and videogame segments.

The 50-year-old Sony veteran has been widely viewed as the man behind the curtain in implementing Sony몭s structural reforms aimed at returning the company to profit in the next fiscal year, which begins in April.

Sony in September lowered its earnings forecast for the year ending in March as it plans to write down the book value of the mobile segment, a move that was welcomed by some analysts as proof that Mr. Totoki and Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida were taking a greater control of the company.

Sony몭s July-September quarterly earnings are due to be released on Friday. The company is expected to record a big net loss because of the announced ?180 billion ($1.65 billion) mobile division write-down. It is also plans to lower its sales goals for its Xperia smartphones for the current year. Sony already cut the figure once, in July.

TOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Sony Corp said on Thursday it would appoint senior vice president Hiroki Totoki as the new president of Sony Mobile Communications on Nov. 16, replacing Kunimasa Suzuki at the top of its troubled smartphone business.

Totoki is currently serving as corporate planning director after Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai pulled him back from a subsidiary to headquarters as one of his closest confidantes along with Kenichiro Yoshida, chief financial officer.

Slow sales of Sony's Xperia smartphones have weighed on the company's flagship electronics division, prompting it to cut its sales forecast once this year and sparking media reports that it will do so again when it announces results on Friday.

How the Kinks Roughed Up Their Sound; To come up with the fuzzy distortion on 몬You Really Got Me,몭 members of the Kinks distressed their speakers with knitting needles and razor blades. A look at how the influential 1964 hit took shape

Before garage rock and heavy metal, there were the Kinks. In 1964, the London band몭s use of power chords and fuzzy distortion on 몮You Really Got Me몯 influenced the Rolling Stones (몮Satisfaction몯), the Beatles (몮Think for Yourself몯), the Yardbirds (몮Heart Full of Soul몯) and other groups in 1965 and beyond.

When 몮You Really Got Me몯 was released in August 몭64, the single went to No. 1 in Britain and No. 7 in the U.S., and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Fifty years later멪with the release of 몮The Essential Kinks몯 (Sony)멪Ray Davies, 70, the song몭s composer and band몭s lead singer; his brother and lead guitarist Dave Davies, 67, (whose CD 몮Rippin몭 Up Time몯 is due out on Tuesday); and the single몭s producer Shel Talmy, 77, talked about the hit몭s inspiration and development. Edited from interviews:

Ray Davies: Just after I formed the Ravens in 1963 with my brother Dave and bassist Pete Quaife, we began wearing colorful outfits bought in boutiques on London몭s Carnaby Street. Months later at a pub with our manager, Larry Page, I insisted we needed an edgier name than the Ravens. A drunk who had been watching us said we looked like kinks to him멪short for kinky or weird. Larry picked up on that and said, 몮The Kinks! That몭s perfect!몯

Before the Ravens, while I was still at college, I played in the Dave Hunt Blues Band, a gritty R&B-jazz crossover group. Around this time I wrote 몮You Really Got Me몯 on my guitar at my sister몭s house in North London. My influences were country and blues멪something that [blues guitarist] Big Bill Broonzy would play.

The inspiration for the lyrics and title came to me one night while playing with Dave Hunt at The Scene Club in Soho. During our set, I looked out in the darkness about 10 feet from the stage and saw what appeared to be a 17-year-old girl moving better than anyone else on the dance floor. She had ash-colored hair set in a beehive style popular then. When we finished, I went off to find her, but she was gone and never returned to the club. She really got me going.

When I played the song first for Pete, our bassist, he said he didn몭t care for it. It didn몭t sound commercial enough for him멪not pop enough. He thought it was almost too basic to be a teen song. Then I played it for the rest of the band in the front room of my family몭s house in London. Everyone liked it. I wanted it to sound coarse, the way we came across through club speakers that couldn몭t handle the volume. Then I set the song aside.

In 1964, after we changed our name to the Kinks, we were under a lot of pressure to come up with a hit for our label, Pye Records. Our first two singles멪몮Long Tall Sally몯 and 몮You Still Want Me몯멪hadn몭t charted. So I pulled out 몮You Really Got Me몯 and went to work on it. I played the riff on the piano at my parents몭 house. Dave learned the song and played the chords on his guitar. I wanted the song to sound like a Gregorian chant멪with its repetitive theme멪over a blues. I also wanted to dirty up the guitar sound.

I also wanted a distorted bass sound with echo effect, the way Ray Charles몭s electric piano sounded on 몮What I몭d Say몯 coming through the bad speaker of my parents몭 record player. To try to emulate that sound, I punched a few holes in Pete몭s preamp speaker with my mother몭s knitting needle.

Dave Davies: I always liked how our band sounded at clubs멪coarse and sort of stripped down. Months earlier I had passed a radio shop a few doors up from my parents몭 house on Denmark Terrace. In the window I saw a small teal space-age Elpico amp for 10 quid. I bought it, but when I got home, I was alone and had a moment of teenage inspiration or rage. I had just learned to shave, so I took one of my razorblades and slashed up the amp몭s speaker cone. I had no idea whether what I had done would work, but when I plugged in the guitar, I was blown away by the raucous sound that came out. It was gritty. Up until then, rock guitars in London had sounded very clean and polished, except for blues players. But the blues sound wasn몭t what I had in my head then. It was just rage.

Ray Davies: Our first recording of 몮You Really Got Me몯 was a demo we made at Regent Sounds on London몭s Denmark Street. Shel Talmy, an American independent record producer who was working in London at the time, liked what he heard.

Shel Talmy: When I arrived in London in 1962, I expected to stay only a few weeks. But after I met with A&R chief Dick Rowe at Decca, he hired me to bring in new artists and record them. A year later, I was visiting some friends at a music publisher on Denmark Street when Robert Wace, the manager of some band called the Kinks, came into reception and asked if anyone wanted to hear a demo. I volunteered. After we listened in my friend몭s office, I thought the demo had a number of potential hits. By then, I was ticked at Decca for turning down two bands I had brought in to be signed멪Manfred Mann and Georgie Fame. So after I met the Kinks, we went into Pye in 몭64 to record their first two singles. When those didn몭t chart, we recorded 몮You Really Got Me.몯 Pye executives loved the playback but two days later, Ray said he didn몭t like it and wanted to rerecord the song.

Ray Davies: It was too slow, and the engineers had cleaned up our distortion, adding echo and making it sound perfect, which was exactly what I didn몭t want to happen. I wanted the single to sound live and raw, the way we sounded live at clubs. After some back and forth, the label agreed to let us rerecord provided we paid for it. So I borrowed ?200 from our managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace. A few weeks later, we rerecorded 몮You Really Got Me몯 at London몭s IBC Studios. I thought about adding a specific girl몭s name to the lyric but decided against it. I had sung, 몮Girl, you really got me goin몭 몯 at most of our gigs and stuck with that.

Dave Davies: I was quite an angry kid. I got my aggression out through my music. For the opening chords at IBC, I used bar chords멪holding down three strings and strumming hard and them shifting my fingers to a different place on the neck. I picked that up from listening to the Ventures몭 몮Walk멪Don몭t Run.몯 Their rhythm guitarist, Don Wilson, wasn몭t playing the full chords멪he was just hitting the bottom three notes. I thought that was great멪I could do that and not worry about fifths and sixths and things I didn몭t know yet.

Mr. Talmy: At IBC, I placed Ray in an isolation booth so the instruments wouldn몭t bleed into his vocal. For the drums, instead of using four mics, which was standard then, I used 12 to isolate all of the various percussive sounds. I used three mics for Dave멪one in front of his amp, another on a boom at a distance and one pointed at his guitar strings. Each mic picked up different parts of what he was playing, and I combined them later to get the sound you hear on the single. The mic on Dave몭s strings picked up the tinny sound that, when mixed with the other two, gave his guitar a nice top. The Kinks didn몭t have a drummer yet, so I hired Bobby Graham, the best English session drummer at the time for rock. I played the tambourine.

I also overdubbed background vocals to enhance Dave몭s riff. Dave, Pete, Ray and Rasa,멪Ray몭s wife at the time멪sang the background track at one mic. Then I had everyone switch positions and I double-tracked the vocals so there would be more dimension.

Ray Davies: To me, the sheer power of Dave몭s hands combined with the anger and aggression with which he played the riff of my song counted more than any distorting speaker.

After we recorded at IBC, we went on Britain몭s 몮Ready, Steady Go몯 TV show in July 몬64, just before the single몭s release. Once teens saw us and heard our metallic sound, the excitement built and the single took off after its release the following week. Part of what the audience was responding to was the song몭s key shift from G to A. The more natural and melodic place for the song to go was from G to C or D. But I wanted it to go to A, which was quite revolutionary then. There몭s something about that full step up that feels like acceleration and raises the excitement level. The progression actually made me shudder when I originally came up with it.

It몭s funny, the song began as a way for me to reach out to that girl at The Scene, to let her know how I felt. I never found her or met her later, but I sort of like to imagine that she knows 몮You Really Got Me몯 was written for her and that she몭s out there still, an age-old diamond.

Nintendo Logs Better-Than-Expected Net Profit; Japanese Game Maker Profits on Weaker Yen, Stronger Software Sales

OSAKA멪Nintendo Co. on Wednesday said a weak yen and sales of popular game titles boosted its quarterly performance and the company몭s hopes for a full-year profit멪even as skepticism among industry watchers persists.

The Kyoto-based game maker reported net profit of ?24.22 billion ($224 million) in the three months ended September, well above analysts몭 expectations and a turnaround from an ?8 billion loss a year earlier.

President Satoru Iwata said Nintendo is poised to break a three-year streak of operating losses and is on track for a net profit of ?20 billion for its March-ending fiscal year, after a loss of ?46 billion in the preceding year. 몮What we are seeing right now is good proof that our business still has a lot of growth potential,몯 Mr. Iwata said at an earnings conference.

The surprisingly strong results for its fiscal second quarter give Nintendo some breathing room, as Mr. Iwata tries to persuade investors that the company몭s strategy of sticking to game consoles is sound. Players have been shifting to smartphones, downloading games as free apps rather than buying consoles and packaged games of the sort that Nintendo thrived on during the heyday of its Super Mario Brothers franchise.

Nintendo, which has steadfastly resisted licensing its games for use on smartphones, gave no hint Wednesday that it might rethink its approach.

The company is scheduled to give a separate briefing on strategy Thursday.

For its latest quarter, Nintendo highlighted solid sales of 몮Smash Brothers몯 and other games for its hand-held 3DS game console, which was developed in-house. Although 3DS sales were weaker in the quarter멪1.27 million consoles compared with 2.49 million a year earlier, Mr. Iwata said he is confident the sales would pick up as popular titles, including new Pok?mon games, are released later this year.

The yen몭s weakness has been a boon, inflating the value, in yen terms, of Nintendo몭s sizable pool of assets held in dollars and euros. About 40% of Nintendo몭s revenue comes from North America, while the European region accounts for 30% and the Japanese market 25%.

Still, for Nintendo and its competitors, the current quarter and its year-end shopping season hold the key, and Mr. Iwata said the company is banking on its pending release of strong game titles.

Many analysts ahead of Nintendo몭s earnings announcement said the picture for the game maker remains grim and its earnings target is likely out of reach. Nintendo몭s latest home console, the Wii U, launched in November 2012, has sold 7.29 million units, compared with more than 10 million for Sony Corp.몭s PlayStation 4, which went on sale a year later.

In the recent quarter, Wii U sales more than doubled from a year earlier to 610,000 units. For the full year, Nintendo is aiming for 3.6 million Wii U sales, up from 2.7 million units, while keeping sales of the 3DS roughly flat at 12 million units. 몮We believe our business is in line with our forecast, and the unit target isn몭t impossible to achieve,몯 Mr. Iwata said, stressing that analysts have been too pessimistic.

Many analysts say the company needs to tap into businesses such as smartphone applications and new markets like China to achieve sustainable growth.

몮Console gaming is becoming increasingly niche compared with the mass-market app-based gaming that has exploded through social media and mobile devices like smartphones and tablets,몯 said Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, after the Nintendo announcement.

Mr. Iwata hinted the company is making progress in expanding to China. Earlier in the year, he also alluded to new initiatives such as health care-related business, word of which could come at Thursday몭s strategy briefing.

(The Day Ahead is an email and PDF publication that includes the day's major stories and events, analyses and other features. To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) The U.S. Commerce Department releases gross domestic product figures. The economy likely advanced at a solid 3.0 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The figure would mark a slowdown from the second quarter's outsized 4.6 percent gain, but a reading of domestic demand likely gained speed with much less of the strength coming from inventories - a sign of growing fundamental strength. While weakness overseas has raised questions over the sustainability of above-trend U.S. growth, many economists think a tightening labor market is providing the fuel needed to keep the recovery on track (0830/1230). The Labor Department releases weekly unemployment claims data (0830/1230).

Mastercard Inc's volume growth has been decelerating due to a key issuer loss. Shares of the world's second-largest payments company are down as much as 12 percent this year on investor concerns about international sanctions on Russia and competition from new forms of mobile-based payments. The company reports third-quarter results and is expected to implement merchant-acquiring fee increases in January that could add to its revenue growth and earnings. Time Warner Cable Inc reports third-quarter results before the bell. Investors will be looking for any comment regarding the decision of HBO and CBS to go over-the-top and anything new on the pending merger with Comcast. Social networking website for professionals LinkedIn Corp reports third-quarter results. LinkedIn is likely to beat the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine data, as it gains market share from job sites such as Monster.com and Careerbuilder. The company is also expected to benefit from its timeline ads and growing user base. Investors would focus on user growth rate and engagement after social media companies such as Twitter reported slowing user engagement. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen gives welcome remarks before the "National Summit on Diversity in the Economics Profession" conference hosted by the Federal Reserve, in Washington (0900/1300). Brazilian miner Vale SA is expected to post a hefty drop in third-quarter earnings as iron ore prices fell to five-year-lows during the quarter. Investors will be keeping an eye out for any news on cuts to investment projections or any projects that might be dropped. Gold miners Newmont Mining Corp and Goldcorp Inc reports third-quarter results. Newmont is expected to report a drop in third-quarter profit and lower revenue. The company resumed copper concentrate shipments from Indonesia in late September, ending a nine-month suspension from its Batu Hijau mine after the government imposed hefty export taxes. Analysts will watch for any changes to Newmont's production forecasts, which the company updated in late September. Goldcorp is expected to report a dip in profit, but higher revenue. Any changes to production forecasts will be a key focus for investors. Some analysts expect the start up of Goldcorp's Cerro Negro mine in Argentina and resumption of production at the Los Filos mine to boost quarterly production. Also of interest are any comments about the El Morro gold and copper project. Mosaic Co reports third-quarter results after recently curtailing phosphate output due to rising costs. Of interest is any update on how long the curtailment will last and thoughts on timing of a potash supply contract between China's Sinofert and Canpotex, a company owned by Mosaic and other North American miners. Starbucks Corp, the world's biggest coffee chain, posts fourth-quarter results before the bell. Investors expect Starbucks to report another quarter of red-hot U.S. cafe sales, but are braced for any inkling of a cooling trend. They will also keep an eye on its performance in China, where sales at KFC and McDonald's have been hard hit by a meat supplier scandal. Western Union Co, the world's largest money-transfer company, is expected to report a dip in third-quarter profit, hurt by higher regulatory costs. The company is facing rising costs as regulators worldwide crack down on money laundering. Western Union, which has ramped up its digital money transfer business, is being investigated by U.S. regulators for misrepresenting the performance of its digital unit. The company has pushed its guidance of $500 million in digital revenue beyond 2015. Western Union has been negatively affected by slowing consumer money transfer growth due to low foreign exchange volatility. Health insurer Cigna Corp, which has traditionally focused on employer-based health plans, is expected to report a decline in third-quarter profit. Asset manager Invesco Ltd is scheduled to report third-quarter results before market opens. Analysts expect the money manager to earn 62 cents per share, up from 55 cents per share a year earlier. Kellogg Co, the world's largest maker of breakfast cereal, cut its full-year adjusted sales and profit forecasts in July as demand for its Corn Flakes and Special K cereals continued to wane in the United States, its biggest market. The company has reported five straight quarters of sales declines in its U.S. cereal business, hurt by the rising popularity of other breakfast items such as yogurt and frozen egg sandwiches. When the company reports third-quarter results, investors will look for details on how it plans to revive its U.S. business and implement its strategy of repositioning its brands to focus on their nutritional value. ConocoPhillips is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings and update investors on its big investment in growing production from U.S. shale fields including the Eagle Ford in south Texas in a time when crude oil prices have fallen more than 20 percent. National Oilwell Varco Inc, the largest U.S. oilfield equipment provider, is expected to post a higher third-quarter profit, buoyed by demand for its land rigs and jack-up rigs, which are used in shallower waters. Investors will look for any outlook on capital spending considering the recent downward spiral of oil prices. Offshore driller ENSCO Plc is expected to report a lower third-quarter profit, hurt by weak demand, which has in turn led to an oversupply of rigs. Investors will be on the lookout for any efforts to reduce costs and comment on drilling activity and customer response, giving the decline in oil prices. Coal miner Alpha Natural Resources Inc, which is struggling with falling prices for steel-making coal and government regulations that are causing electric utilities to close coal-fired power plants, is expected to report a bigger third-quarter loss and third straight drop in quarterly revenue. Investors will be looking for comments on further cuts in coal production, impact of the rail issues, demand for steel-making coal and further cost-cutting initiatives. Auto parts maker Johnson Controls Inc is likely to benefit from higher demand in its power solutions unit as automakers increasingly look to build more fuel-efficient vehicles. When the company reports fourth-quarter results, investors will be looking for comments on its JV with Chinese company Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems, a move that is expected to create the world's largest automotive interiors company. Harman International Industries Inc, which makes car audio systems, is expected to post first-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, according to StarMine data. The company is expected to benefit from higher sales of its car audio systems. Investors will be looking out for updates to the company's full-year outlook. GoPro Inc is likely to post a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, according to StarMine, helped by strong demand for its wearable cameras used to record outdoor activities and sports. The company recently launched an entry-level camera and a new flagship camera - Hero4 - ahead of the holiday shopping season as competition intensifies in the wearable camera market with rivals such as Garmin, Sony, JVC and even HTC launching or revamping their offerings. Online travel agency Expedia Inc, which gets more than half of its revenue from the United States, is expected to post higher third-quarter revenue and profit, driven by higher hotel and flight bookings. Investors will look for an update on how world travel concerns due to Ebola may impact the company in the current quarter. News and information company Thomson Reuters Corp reports third-quarter results. The company said net sales for its financial products were positive in the second quarter and analysts and investors will be keen to hear if that is a trend. Additionally, there likely will be questions around new messaging products out in the marketplace that are trying to displace Bloomberg. The New York Times Co reports third-quarter results. Subscription revenue growth is slowing though the company made big strides in online advertising. Questions remain about where it plans to cut after it announced a reduction in staff earlier this month. Outerwall Inc, the operator of Redbox video rental kiosks, is expected to report third-quarter revenue above estimates, according to StarMine data. The company, which is grappling with lower revenue from the Redbox video rental kiosk business, is expected to benefit from the release of a number of blockbuster movies on DVDs in the second half of the year. Navigation software maker Trimble Navigation Ltd is expected to report a third-quarter profit below analysts' estimates, according to StarMine data. Investors will look for comments on its fourth-quarter forecast. Audio chipmaker Audience Inc is expected to report third-quarter revenue below estimates after its biggest customer, Samsung, warned of increasing competition and weak earnings. Analysts will be looking for fourth-quarter guidance from the company, which supplies chips that improve voice quality in mobile phones. Beauty products company Elizabeth Arden Inc, struggling with weak sales for the past year, is expected to report another disappointing quarter as sales of perfumes, its biggest division, continues to shrink. When the company report first-quarter results, investors will watch out for its progress on restructuring and new product launches this holiday season. Brazil's IGP-M index, which encompasses wholesale, construction costs and consumer prices, is the country's broadest price measure and data for October is scheduled for release. It has declined in recent months as wholesale food prices dropped, suggesting a relief in consumer inflation in coming months. Chile's unemployment figures for July-September are also expected in the day. Jobless numbers have been gradually creeping up as the economic slowdown bites.

* Q2 operating profit 9.3 bln yen; analysts expected loss

* Wii U sales picked up after Mario game launch in May -CEO

* Weak yen a tailwind heading into key year-end sales season (Adds CEO comments on business and own health, weak yen)

By Reiji Murai

OSAKA, Japan Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japanese video game maker Nintendo Co vaulted to an unexpected quarterly operating profit as new game "Mario Kart 8" stoked sales of its Wii U console, bolstering hopes it was on track for its first annual profit in four years.

A weaker yen also boosted the value of its overseas earnings, and the company on Wednesday reported an operating profit of 9.3 billion yen ($86 million) in its fiscal second quarter, compared with an 18 billion yen operating loss a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a 3.7 billion yen loss for July-September, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine.

Ahead of the vital year-end holiday sales season, the results may ease pressure on Chief Executive Satoru Iwata, who is recovering from surgery in June to remove a tumour in his bile duct. As losses mounted in recent years, Iwata, 54 and in the job since 2002, resisted calls for a major overhaul to make famous Nintendo characters like plumber Mario available for games on smartphones, rather than just its own hardware.

As well as facing the challenge of free mobile games played on phones and tablet computers, Nintendo has struggled to keep pace with Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp, now dominant in the home video console market.

Nintendo reiterated its forecast for a full-year operating profit of 40 billion yen, compared with an operating loss of 46.4 billion yen in the previous year. Analysts have been sceptical on this year's target, as well as the company's strategy, with the average estimate prior to Wednesday's announcement being for a 24 billion yen profit.

On Wednesday, the company said sales of its Wii U home games console, the latest version of its now-ageing Wii product, more than doubled in the April-September period from a year earlier, rising to 1.1 million units.

Iwata told reporters that Wii U sales had improved since "Mario Kart 8", the latest game to feature Mario, went on sale in May. With the year-end holiday sales period coming up, he said the company still aims to sell 3.6 million of the consoles in the current business year though March 2015.

"Through April to September we saw sales improve, especially overseas in the U.S. and European markets," Iwata said of the Wii U. "This year is different to last year, when we headed into the year-end without momentum or good software prospects...The goal is fully achievable."

Nintendo said it was also being helped by a cheaper yen, which boosts the value of overseas sales. The yen's downward trend inflated its operating profit by around 2 billion yen over the April-September period, it said.

RETURN TO HEALTH

In his first appearance before reporters since his surgery, Iwata said he now felt well enough to resume regular work duties. The executive was visibly thinner, but said his weight had stabilised over the past two months.

"Of course it was a major illness and surgery, so compared to before, I may shorten the time I'm at work, or perhaps I may cut back on overseas business trips. But in terms of holding meetings, considering strategy, and speaking publicly, I believe I've recovered enough to work as I had before," he said.

As for the business itself, Iwata said Nintendo was heading in a "good direction" ahead of the crucial holiday season.

The company's shares have fallen around 20 percent this year and about 85 percent from their 2007 high, as the heyday Nintendo enjoyed with the Wii console's then-hot status fades into the distance.

Instead of radical strategic change, Nintendo has pinned hopes on hit games such as "Mario Kart 8". The Wii U, the latest version of the console that first hit the market in 2006, was launched in December 2012, but sales had previously fallen short of projections.

The company also maintained its forecast to sell 12 million of its 3DS handheld game players this business year though March 2015.

Outerwall몭s Redbox, Lions Gate Reach New Deal on Movie Rentals

Outerwall Inc.몭s Redbox has signed a new two-year deal with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. that helps to alleviate investor concerns about the DVD kiosk company몭s ability to maintain relations with Hollywood amid major changes to its business.

Lions Gate몭s prior deal with Redbox had expired on Aug. 31 and, as weeks went by with no news, some analysts had begun to question whether there were issues between the two companies.

As with its previous deal, Lions Gate will continue to allow Redbox to rent its DVDs and Blu-ray discs the same day they go on sale. Three other studios delay Redbox rentals until four weeks after their DVDs are available to buy, in a bid to boost more profitable purchases. Redbox pays less for new movies available only on a delayed basis.

The new Lions Gate agreement expires in September 2016 and includes an option to renew.

Sony Corp.몭s Sony Pictures Entertainment and Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures both recently exercised options to renew their deals with Redbox by one year, until September 2015 and December 2015, respectively.

Redbox몭s revenue and operating income declined in the quarter ended June 30 as the once fast-growing company has stalled, with few new locations to install kiosks and increasing competition from digital outlets. A joint venture to rent movies online with Verizon Communications Inc. was recently shut down after performing poorly.

Earlier this year, Outerwall hired a veteran Warner Bros. executive to take over the Redbox business in a bid to transform it and return to growth.

Deals with Time Warner Inc.몭s Warner Bros. and Viacom Inc.몭s Paramount Pictures expire in December, while one with 21st Century Fox Inc.몭s Twentieth Century Fox ends in April.

Real Estate
In Office Market, L.A. Is a Real Drag; Aon Center Was Sold at a Steep Discount

Values for trophy office buildings in large U.S. cities led by New York, San Francisco and Houston have risen sharply in the past few years, due in large part to demand for office space from the technology and energy industries.

Los Angeles, particularly the downtown section of the city, has been a different story.

Consider the recent sale of the Aon Center, the second-tallest tower on the Los Angeles skyline. The 40-year-old, 60-story property sits on the edge of the city몭s financial district on Wilshire Boulevard.

Earlier this month, San Francisco-based Shorenstein Properties LLC. purchased the building from Beacon Capital Partners of Boston for $269 million, about 18% less than what Beacon Capital paid for the building seven years ago.

Beacon Capital wouldn몭t discuss why the building lost value, but Arty Maharajh, who tracks the Los Angeles office market for commercial broker Cassidy Turley, says years of rising vacancy rates are a primary cause.

The building is currently about 40% vacant.

When Beacon purchased Aon Center in 2007, 몮it was well leased up and today it is almost half empty,몯 said Mr. Maharajh, a vice president of research. And pointing to forecasts for downtown Los Angeles office space that show little hope of improved future demand, he adds, 몮The risk level downtown is DefCon 5.몯

To be sure, the office market is doing well in some Los Angeles communities. Technology tenants such as Google Inc.몭s YouTube, gossip website TMZ and Sony Corp.몭s PlayStation have rushed to the Playa Vista neighborhood near the airport, rapidly filling up new developments at fast-rising rents. Low-slung Santa Monica has some of the highest rents in the city, well above downtown, and attracts private-equity firms and other cash-rich tenants.

But downtown Los Angeles, filled with dozens of buildings built in the 1970s to 1980s modeled after New York skyscrapers, generally hasn몭t been attractive to technology companies, which prefer the flexibility to build from the ground up or rehab old industrial buildings.

Meanwhile, the traditional industries located downtown멪finance, legal and accounting firms멪continue to scale back and few analysts expect that to change soon.

Paul Habibi, a professor of finance and real estate at UCLA몭s Anderson Graduate School of Management, estimates that 100,000 square feet of office space has been absorbed downtown this year.

몮That몭s a drop in the bucket.멞It몭s not enough to move the needle and that몭s in light of the fact that zero new square feet of office space has been delivered downtown,몯 he said.

So why, considering such a grim prognosis, did Shorenstein buy the Aon Center? Shorenstein and several other office landlords and foreign investors that are buying downtown properties are betting that the area is at the start of a transformation. Other recent buyers include Brookfield Property Partners, Overseas Union Ltd. and Commonwealth Partners.

Russell Cooper, who heads acquisitions for Shorenstein in the Western U.S., concedes that the city몭s downtown office market has been weak. But his firm is betting that demand for downtown office space will increase in the future as the area becomes a more attractive place to live, which eventually will encourage employers to relocate there, too.

In September, condo prices were 14% higher than a year earlier, exceeding by two percentage points the rate of growth in San Francisco, according to real-estate research and marketing firm the Mark Co., which notes that 3,700 new rental units are under construction.

Mr. Cooper said downtown몭s growing residential population, its burgeoning night-life scene and the city몭s rapidly expanding subway and light-rail lines are creating more interest from employers such as architecture and engineering firms, including tenants currently on L.A.몭s Westside.

몮Tenants are looking to move downtown because it몭s a good place멞for employees,몯 he said. 몮And while the building is older, it lends itself to smaller users.몯

Cassidy Turley몭s Mr. Maharajh isn몭t convinced. He believes the downtown office market won몭t improve soon and that many buyers of skyscrapers, which include foreign investors who believe they have found bargains, will be disappointed.

In any event, Shorenstein isn몭t solely focused on one high-rise office tower. Reflecting the company몭s increasing shift into the more tech- and creative-focused markets, Shorenstein purchased a mostly vacant former manufacturing building in the city몭s downtown Arts District in March, and it is part owner of a former postal distribution center in Playa Vista, a popular new hub for tech companies on the Westside.

U.S. regulators to vote on treating Internet TV like cable

WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission in coming weeks will vote on whether Internet TV should have the same access to television programming as cable and satellite TV providers, which could shake up competition in the video industry.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler on Tuesday said he has asked his fellow commissioners to vote on a proposal that would help Internet TV services, such as ones being developed by Dish Network Corp, Sony Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, to compete with traditional pay-TV for digital rights to major network programming.

The potential regulatory change concerns online subscription video services that offer scheduled programming similar to traditional pay-TV providers, and not online video services such as Netflix Inc that stream content on demand.

Satellite provider DirecTV is another company that has indicated plans for an Internet video service and CBS Corp this month revealed a plan for an Internet streaming service that would include scheduled programming.

Time Warner Inc's HBO will also launch a standalone online streaming product but its details are unclear.

Traditionally, the FCC has ensured that cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp could negotiate for rights to retransmit network programming. Online video services have not had the same regulatory backing because they rely on a different technology and do not have their own video distribution facilities.

Now, the FCC will vote on leveling the playing field with a technology-neutral definition of a "multichannel video program distributor," with the goal of encouraging new competition in the video market.

"Twenty-first century consumers shouldn't be shackled to rules that only recognize 20th-century technology," Wheeler said in a blog post on Tuesday.

"Consumers have long complained about how their cable service forces them to buy channels they never watch. The move of video onto the Internet can do something about that frustration, but first Internet video services need access to the programs."

A draft of the proposal tentatively concludes that online TV services should have the same access to cable and local TV programs as traditional pay-TV services and seeks comments on whether the obligations imposed on the two types of video services should also be the same.

If adopted, some analysts see the proposal as potentially also creating a new opening for Aereo, a video streaming company whose business model was questioned by a Supreme Court ruling in June that said the company had infringed broadcasters' copyrights by capturing live and recorded programs through antennas and transmitting them to subscribers.

The vote by four FCC commissioners, two Democrats and two Republicans, would formally propose the idea and begin the process of seeking public comments. (Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Tom Brown)

UPDATE 1-Smartphone launches boost Gorilla glass maker Corning

(Adds executive comments, details, estimates, shares)

By Abhirup Roy

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Corning Inc, the supplier of Gorilla glass to Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics , reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings, helped by launches of new smartphone models.

Shares of the company, which also supplies LCD panels to consumer electronics companies such as Sony Corp, LG and Lenovo Group, rose 1.6 percent in early trading.

Smartphones such as Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and Samsung's Galaxy Alpha were launched in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Corning said it would launch a new version of Gorilla glass on Nov. 20.

The company, however, said fourth-quarter core sales in its speciality materials business, which makes Gorilla glass, were expected to decline by low- to mid-teen digits percent from the third quarter due to the absence of any major new launches.

"What happens after a new launch is at some point, they take enough glass to continue to build out their products and that's why we think that in the fourth quarter, we'll see sales down," Senior Vice President Tony Tripeny told Reuters.

Its LCD panel volumes in the current quarter are expected to be flat or fall slightly from the previous quarter as most of the holiday season orders had been shipped in the third quarter, Tripeny said.

Corning had been hurt by falling LCD glass prices in the past few quarters, but the company said the pace of the price decline was moderating.

The company's core net sales rose to $2.65 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.1 billion, a year earlier.

Net income rose to $1.01 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $408 million, or 28 cents per share.

The company reported core earnings of 40 cents per share.

Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of 37 cents per share and revenue of $2.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Corning shares were up 1 percent at $19.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by Kirti Pandey)

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has recruited a well-known veteran of Dell Inc. to lead one of the chip maker몭s two main business groups.

Forrest Norrod, 49 years old, was most recently vice president in charge of Dell몭s server systems business. Prior to that role, he led an organization that developed custom-tailored servers for companies in the hyperscale market, AMD said. Hyperscale refers to Web services like Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. that serve a profusion of Web pages and consequently buy large numbers of computer servers.

At AMD, Mr. Norrod will take the role of senior vice president and general manager of the business group in charge of enterprise, embedded and semicustom chips. Besides chips for servers, the unit designs chips to order for applications such as the latest Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. videogame systems.

Mr. Norrod will report to Lisa Su, who recently succeeded Rory Read as AMD몭s chief executive. She said in prepared remarks that Mr. Norrod had the unique skills 몮to lead AMD into an expanded set of markets where our differentiated technology assets provide a competitive advantage.몯

AMD, which competes with Intel Corp. for sales of chips using a popular design called x86, once accounted for about a third of server chips using that technology. But its share recently dwindled to less 3%, according to the firm Mercury Research.

Dell veteran Ashley Gorakhpurwalla will assume Mr. Norrod몭s former responsibilities, said Dell spokesperson Jim Hahn in an email. Mr. Norrod몭s last day at the company was Oct. 1, the spokesperson added.

몮Forrest Norrod recently notified Dell of his desire to take some time off and then pursue other opportunities,몯 Mr. Hahn said. 몮We thank him for his contributions and wish him well in future endeavors.몯

Paramount Pictures, Movie Investors in Mean Fight; As 몬Slate Deals몭 Make a Comeback, Litigation Over Old Contract Shows Pitfalls

It has been 10 years since the comedy 몮Mean Girls몯 and a remake of 몮The Manchurian Candidate몯 starring Denzel Washington played in theaters. But in a New York courtroom last week, they took center stage.

The films were among a group of 25 releases from Paramount Pictures that have been the subject of a nasty court fight, including accusations of dishonesty and fraud. Four investors who were part of a $231 million deal to co-finance the movies멪a 몮slate deal몯 in Hollywood parlance멪are suing to get back part of their $40.1 million investment, all of which was lost in the deal.

몮This language is a lie,몯 said a lawyer for the plaintiffs in opening arguments Tuesday, pointing to a document used by Paramount to sell the deal.

몮Plaintiffs chose this business,몯 countered an attorney for the studio, which is owned by Viacom Inc. 몮It몭s an unpredictable business.몯

Slate deals, which were common in Hollywood about 10 years ago and have recently made a comeback, have generated a lot of lawsuits and behind-the-scenes fights멪though most have been resolved without spilling into the glare of open court.

Paramount has defended itself in four such lawsuits in recent years, more than any other major studio. Two of Paramount몭s cases were settled out of court, and the studio prevailed in a third case that went to trial and was upheld on appeal. The fourth is the one currently in court.

Slate financing deals at Sony Corp.몭s Sony Pictures and Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures몭 also resulted in separate lawsuits. The case involving the Sony deal is ongoing, though the studio isn몭t a party.

A decade ago, hedge funds and other big investors flocked to Hollywood, convinced that by backing not just one but a slate of several dozen films at a major studio they could minimize the risk inherent in the movie business. The hits would offset the flops, or so the thinking went. And with DVD sales booming at the time, the slate financing strategy looked like a safe way to buy a little showbiz glamour.

Most of the deals, however, enjoyed anything but Hollywood endings. DVD sales stopped growing, risky big-budget tentpoles became more common, and the often opaque complexities of film finance멪with fees for studios and talent taken off the top멪and revenue that arrives slowly from a wide variety of sources, resulted in lower profits than some investors had expected. Some quietly left with lighter wallets, but others fought the studios.

몮When it comes to film financing, there몭s always money in an audit,몯 said Clark Hallren, a consultant who was previously a managing director at J.P. Morgan몭s entertainment industries group. 몮The question is whether the additional money you몭ll find is greater than the cost of litigation.몯

Some cases were settled out of the public eye. After hedge fund Elliott Management initiated an audit at Universal over a money-losing slate deal, the two sides agreed last year that the studio would buy back Elliott몭s interest in some of its films, according to people involved in the negotiation.

Slate deals petered out in the wake of the financial crisis of late 2008 and 2009, but have recently returned. Every major studio except Walt Disney Co., which eschews such partnerships, has in the past two years signed or renewed at least one major co-financing arrangement.

The people behind some of those agreements say they learned lessons from deals gone bad in the 2000s and are now taking on less debt and being more selective about the management teams with which they work or films they back.

But such claims have been made in decades past as studios have gone through one wave of financiers after another.

몮The history of these deals is littered with the remains of investors who thought they understood the transaction simply because they succeeded at other businesses,몯 said film financier David Molner, who was a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits against Paramount that was settled.

In the case being argued in New York, Allianz Risk Transfer AG, a unit of German insurance giant Allianz, and three co-plaintiffs are seeking to recover more than $16 million from their original investment, as well as punitive damages. In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan they accused the studio of fraud and unjust enrichment.

The plaintiffs claim that just as they made their deal with Paramount, the studio cut back on its previous practice of selling most foreign rights on its films in advance멪a strategy that offsets risk, but also limits potential upside. Many movies in the slate were box-office duds, and the losses were higher than they would have been if foreign rights had been sold in advance, as the plaintiffs allege they were led to expect.

Paramount has denied the plaintiffs몭 allegations and said it didn몭t promise to pursue any particular amount of 몮foreign pre-sales.몯

Among Paramount몭s earlier lawsuits, the most unusual involved the actor Tommy Lee Jones, a star of the 2007 Oscar- winning movie 몮No Country for Old Men,몯 whose contract entitled him to a bonus if the film hit a certain box-office gross.

A 몮drafting error몯 in the agreement more than tripled the amount the actor was entitled to receive, to $17.5 million from just under $5 million, according to an appeals-court decision on a 2011 lawsuit filed by the Marathon Funding LLC investors group. An attorney for Mr. Jones said an arbitration judge found the contract was legitimate and that his client ultimately received $16 million.

Marathon, which helped finance 몮No Country몯 and 13 other Paramount films in a deal struck in late 2006, accused the studio of dipping into the investment fund for about $2 million to help cover the expense. A California appeals court found in 2013 that Paramount hadn몭t cheated Marathon by using money from the fund.

몮No matter how smart an investor you are, anyone can be taken,몯 said Mr. Hallren. 몮And no one몭s better at doing that than Hollywood.몯

몬Ouija몭 Scares Up Box-Office Win; Halloween Horror Film Knock몭 Out Brad Pitt몭s 몬Fury몭 With $20 Million Debut

NEW YORK멪The spirits moved 몮Ouija몯 to No. 1 at the box office, with the board-game adaptation leading the weekend with a $20 million debut, according to studio estimates Sunday.

The horror movie release, timed to Halloween, attracted more moviegoers at the North America box office than the Keanu Reeves thriller 몮John Wick.몯 The R-rated hit-man revenge tale from Lions Gate opened with $14.2 million in second place.

Last week몭s top film, the Brad Pitt World War II action film 몮Fury,몯 slid to third with $13 million. In two weeks, the Sony Pictures release has made $46.1 million.

Board-game adaptations such as 몮Ouija몯 have had a checkered history at the box office, with the big-budget 몮Battleship몯멪the last Hasbro game turned into a movie멪famously flopping in 2012. But 몮Oujia,몯 made by Blumhouse Productions and released by Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures, was made for just $5 million, and scared up moviegoers with a micro-budget summoning of brand-name occult.

Two Twentieth Century Fox releases rounded out the domestic top five. David Fincher몭s marital noir 몮Gone Girl,몯 starring Ben Affleck, made $11.1 million in its fourth week, bringing its cumulative total to $124 million. It will soon pass Mr. Fincher몭s 몮Benjamin Button몯 ($127.5 million) to mark the director몭s top box-office hit.

In its second week of release, the animated fantasy 몮The Book of Life몯 earned $9.8 million.

As Hollywood몭s awards season begins to heat up, limited-release titles also made noise at the box office. Easily leading all films in per-screen average were Alejandro Gonz?lez I??rritu몭s black comedy 몮Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),몯 starring Michael Keaton, and the Edward Snowden documentary 몮Citizenfour.몯

Laura Poitras몭 몮Citizenfour몯 drew a $25,000 average opening in five theaters for the Weinstein Co.몭s Radius unit. Expanding to 50 theaters in its second week, Fox Searchlight몭s 몮Birdman몯 took in an average of almost $29,000 per screen.

Fox Searchlight and Twentieth Century Fox parent 21st Century Fox was until last year part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.

Next weekend몭s top film is essentially already decided. Christopher Nolan몭s space travel thriller 몮Interstellar,몯 one of the year몭s most anticipated releases, opens in select theaters Wednesday and then wide on Friday. Mr. Nolan, an ardent advocate for film, is releasing the movie first in about 240 theaters that still project 35mm or 70mm, rather than digital.

Japan몭s Recruit Poised for M&A Splash Overseas; President Says Staffing Company Likely to Buy Marketing Media Firm

TOKYO멪As Japan몭s population shrinks, many firms are seeking further growth overseas through mergers and acquisitions. Poised for its next big deal after successfully relisting its shares just a week ago, Recruit Holdings Co. is no exception.

The listing will help the classified advertisement and human resources company ramp up acquisitions to become the world몭s biggest player in the staffing business by 2020, the company몭s president predicted, citing an investment capacity of about $6.5 billion in the next three to five years.

Masumi Minegishi said Recruit will likely go through with full-scale acquisitions of marketing media companies 몮in the not-so-distant future.몯

Shares of Tokyo-based Recruit, which has a market capitalization of $18 billion that rivals blue-chip firms such as Sony Corp. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., have risen 18% since its IPO in part due to growing expectations for its next M&A steps.

Mr. Minegishi said he is well aware of the mixed feelings of hope and concern that investors have over what the company does next in terms of acquisitions. 몮We몭ve seen a lot of failures in acquisitions made by Japanese companies and some of them pay too much for a target,몯 Mr. Minegishi, who took the helm of the company in 2012, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview Thursday. But 몮we몭ve been successful in past deals,몯 the 50-year-old chief said, citing its two-step M&A approach, in which the Japanese company first makes a smaller investment in a company before deciding whether to make a full-scale acquisition.

Founded in 1960, Recruit started as an employment advertising agency for university newspapers. It expanded rapidly in the era of Japan몭s explosive economic growth of the 1980s, launching publishing enterprises that included a magazine for women looking to change jobs. Despite a bribery scandal and an insider-trading case involving the IPO of a Recruit subsidiary in 1988, Recruit has gained a unique position in the industry as a conglomerate that runs a major staffing firm and a diversified advertising publication business.

Despite its commanding presence throughout Japan, Recruit is a relative newcomer in the world of M&As, largely picking up smaller companies such as U.S. staffing firm CSI Companies in 2010. But in the last four years, it has ramped up its investments overseas, including its acquisitions of U.S.-based Staffmark Holdings and Advantage Resourcing for a combined total of about $700 million and its $1 billion purchase of U.S. job-search website Indeed.com.

몮We are constantly eyeing deals globally and have more than 50 potential targets on our list,몯 Mr. Minegishi said. 몮Our M&A team몭s skills of sourcing (acquisitions) are excellent and it often happens that we have already contacted companies by the time investment banks pitch us deals.몯

Mr. Minegishi said Recruit won몭t just consider making a big acquisition in the staffing business but also online sales promotion firms in the travel, housing and restaurant sectors.

Recruit has made a minority investment in several online services, including U.K. Hotspring Ventures Ltd.멪-a web operator that provides access to health and beauty treatments with listings for spas and salons.

Foreign Companies Are Cooling on China; Slowing Economy, Regulatory Crackdowns Are Forcing Many Multinationals to Scale Back

Foreign companies are wielding their axes in China.

For years, multinationals plowed money into China, hoping to benefit from its fast growth. Now, a combination of slower growth there, weak global demand and a feeling that Beijing has singled out foreign businesses for regulatory crackdowns is pushing an increasing number of companies to cut their staffs.

The number of European companies doing business in China that cut staff in the past year rose to 16% this year from 10% in 2012, according to a survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China. Likewise, the number planning to boost permanent staff fell to 48% this year from 61% in 2012.

몮The gold-rush stage is over,몯 said Kirsten Mao, a partner at ManGo Associates, a Chinese recruiting firm. 몮Many multinationals which have overexpanded in China are now in a restructuring mood.몯

The staff reductions are part of a broader cost-cutting wave among foreign companies operating in China. The European Chamber of Commerce survey said 24% of companies plan to cut costs in China in 2014, up from 22% in 2013.

U.S. companies share the same views. In a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce, 27% of American companies in China said they see no investment expansion in the country over the next year, up from 16% last year.

Some multinationals are plagued by woes outside China. Reductions in China at International Business Machines Corp., Sony Corp., Microsoft Corp.몭s Nokia unit and Adobe Systems Inc. are part of global job cuts.

After years of expansion, some are scaling back. Carlyle Group, the alternative asset management company, is laying off about 10 people working on its China growth fund, according to people familiar with the matter. It closed the growth fund몭s Chengdu office last year and is going to trim the growth-fund team in its Shanghai office and consolidate it with the Beijing team.

A spokesman at Carlyle declined to comment.

Some companies are also fleeing what they see as a hostile business environment in China. Almost half of the American firms surveyed believe foreign companies have been singled out in a string of pricing or anticorruption campaigns that have hit pharmaceutical, tech and auto companies recently, according to the American chamber.

China is also losing its advantages as a low-cost country. Financial-services company DTCC Solutions LLC SRO, a unit of U.S.-based Depository Trust and Clearing Corp., is moving its small Shanghai operation to Wales. A number of companies are making similar moves, consolidating offices and tapping into low-cost English-speaking work forces. The company said it is committed to Asia and is expanding in other offices.

Chinese growth, while still strong by developed-country standards, is slowing, and that is hurting company profits. According to the European Chamber of Commerce, only 63% of European companies in China were profitable in 2013, down from 73% in 2011. Revenue-growth expectations for their China operations are at their lowest levels since the peak of the financial crisis, the group says.

Slower investment demand at multinational companies also has hit staffing companies. Ms. Mao몭s search firm, which has eight offices in China, is looking to close an office. After growing by 50% to 60% annually for the past few years, revenue is likely to be flat in the next two years, she expects.

Landlords and others who cater to expatriates have felt the chill. Adam McWhirter, managing director at Maxxelli Real Estate in Chongqing, said housing allowances have fallen or been stripped away in some cases as companies try to hire local talent instead. Kenny Hon, general manager of the Beijing Riviera, an upscale property development, said occupancy has dropped to 84% from 93% last year, as companies like Shell and Nokia cut jobs.

All this gloom is good news for law firms with labor-dispute practices. Chinese law says companies can only do mass layoffs if they haven몭t made a profit for three years or have been unable to pay employees for eight months. If they don몭t meet those criteria, the layoffs can be blocked.

As money gets tighter, foreign companies also are clamping down on spending. A U.S. company laid off 20 people in China for submitting false dental-reimbursement claims, according to Kevin Jones, partner at law firm Faegre Baker Daniels, which advises on employment matters.

Foreign companies몭 pain may be Chinese companies몭 gain. Some are eager to scoop up well-trained local talent from foreign companies. E-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. recently courted local engineers from Nokia by splashing a 몮Nokia, welcome to Alibaba몯 banner across its recruiting website.

* DIC says cash raised to repay debt ahead of schedule

* DIC may pass excess funds from sale to Dubai Holding

By David French

DUBAI, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Dubai International Capital (DIC) should complete the sale of the two main assets remaining in its portfolio within 18 months, which will provide it with cash to cover its outstanding debt well ahead of scheduled repayment in two years.

Proceeds from the divestment of the five remaining assets should also give the private equity firm surplus funds to pass to its parent firm, Dubai Holding, to help finance its ambitious projects in the emirate, chief executive David Smoot said.

Part of the investment vehicle of Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, DIC rose to prominence in the mid-2000s as it took stakes in global brands including Daimler and Sony, and at one point was heavily linked with a takeover of one of England's biggest soccer clubs, Liverpool FC.

However, like many state-linked entities in the Dubai stable, DIC fell prone to overexuberance and the heavy debt load taken on to finance many of its deals, forcing it into a $2.5 billion restructuring which it completed in April 2012.

Since then, DIC has been selling down its entire portfolio of assets to service its debt, most recently offloading German packaging company Mauser for a total consideration of 1.25 billion euros ($1.72 billion).

With around $1 billion of net debt remaining, which excludes cash it has on its balance sheet, the sales of Doncasters, a British-based engineering aerospace group, and German alumina products maker Almatis will give it the funds to comfortably meet its repayment schedule, Smoot told the Reuters Middle East Investment Summit.

"We have a bullet repayment that's due December 31, 2016. We'll finish our task well inside of that deadline." Under a "bullet" structure, the borrower just pays back the interest on a loan during its lifetime and the full amount at the end.

ASSET SALES

The process of grooming Doncasters, the largest asset left on its books, and Almatis for a sale began this summer and deals with respective buyers should be made within 18 months, Smoot said.

"Assets like this should trade for a double-digit multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation)," said Smoot of Doncasters when asked for expected sale value. It generated an EBITDA of 134 million pounds ($216.56 million) in 2013, he added.

Almatis, around 80 percent owned by DIC with a stake also held by Blackstone unit GSO Capital Partners, had an EBITDA of around $100 million, he said, without giving an expected valuation for the firm.

No investment banks have been mandated to advise on either sale but would likely be selected later to help facilitate the transactions, Smoot said. However, a small team that used to work for consultancy Deloitte was hired by DIC to help prepare the assets for divestment last year.

Two smaller assets could be sold before the end of the year, with Bahraini real estate firm Ishraq, which runs a Holiday Inn Express resort in the kingdom, expected to give DIC around $15 million of cash to reduce its debt pile.

The fate of DIC's final asset, a stake in Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, is dependent on the actions of majority shareholder Investment Corporation of Dubai. DAE has a leasing business but also owns StandardAero, which was linked with a multi-billion-dollar tie-up with BBA Aviation last year.

"Certainly when, or if, the asset comes to market, there will be a lot of interest in it", he said of StandardAero, adding there had been a significant improvement in the firm's performance in the last 18 months, including a restructuring of the workforce and its balance sheet.

DIC 2.0

The positive recovery which DIC has achieved matches a number of other Dubai government-linked entities who have rebounded from their debt problems.

But while the likes of property developer Nakheel have been able to repay their restructured obligations early due to the recovery in Dubai's economy, DIC's assets were mostly outside the emirate.

This meant that DIC was reliant on improving the operating performance of its assets, and the strength of the portfolio has allowed it to fulfill obligations to its creditors, Smoot said.

The process of selling off DIC's assets should leave it with additional cash beyond its restructured debt amount, but Smoot ruled out investing in assets of other Dubai Inc entities in the same way that ICD has acquired companies from state firms struggling with their debt burdens.

"We've proven to be good stewards within the Dubai Inc framework and so, from time to time, we have been asked to look at different situations and I'm sure we'll be asked in the future to do the same", said Smoot of the process which market participants have labelled Dubai's asset shuffle.

"Our only focus right now is making sure we shepherd our remaining assets to a successful conclusion."

However, DIC would be open to channelling cash to its parent firm, Dubai Holding, to help fund a raft of new projects, including plans to build an entertainment district that will include the world's largest shopping mall.

"How much (cash) I don't know but I'm sure it'll be much appreciated by Dubai Holding as they have other uses for the capital."

Smoot said it was too early to define exactly what DIC would look like after the asset sales, although investment advisory or raising cash from third parties to fund new deals were two potential areas of interest.

"You'd want to have multiple partners supporting your business, so you're not overall dependent on a single one, and you'd want to shy away from borrowing money, particularly to fund long-term, illiquid equity investments."

"So that suggests DIC 2.0 is going to look very different from the prior one."

SONY

Smartphone Sales Target Could Drop

Sony Corp. is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, as the business struggles in the face of fierce competition멪especially in emerging markets.

The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43 million for the 12 months ending March 2015, those people said. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50 million, which many analysts said at the time was too optimistic.

The expected revision stems from Sony몭s plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets.

GENERAL DYNAMICS

Defense Contractor Reports Robust Quarter

General Dynamics Corp. on Wednesday reported forecast-beating quarterly profits and increased its 2014 guidance, with signs that orders for its core combat and information technology units have bottomed out.

The company also said it would secure very strong orders for its Gulfstream Aerospace business jets in the fourth quarter, and moved to calm analysts몭 concerns that new models introduced last week could cannibalize sales of its existing lineup.

General Dynamics몭 stock has been the best performer among U.S. aerospace and defense peers this year, driven largely by the contribution of Gulfstream and restructuring efforts that have improved the profitability of its core defense operations.

General Dynamics reported a profit of $696 million for the third quarter compared with $651 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose to $2.06 from $1.84, well ahead of the $1.91 analysts몭 consensus. Revenue edged up 0.2% to $7.75 billion.

BMW

Mini Cooper몭s Fuel Economy Will Be Lowered

BMW AG will reduce the advertised fuel economy of four 2014 Mini Cooper models after an audit by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that the original values were inflated.

The agency has been stepping up its review of the mileage values submitted by auto makers after earlier audits found that the manufacturer-reported mileage claims exceeded the values the agency obtained in its own lab tests. Hyundai Motor Co., Ford Motor Co. and Daimler AG몭s Mercedes-Benz brand have recently revised mileage ratings for certain cars after EPA questioned the original values.

In BMW몭s case, EPA said city, highway or combined mileage estimates for four 2014 Mini Cooper models were overstated by as much as four miles per gallon.

Revenue Fizzles for Lucky Strike Maker

British American Tobacco PLC on Wednesday reported a big fall in nine-month revenue, blaming a slow recovery in Western Europe and pressure on the disposable incomes of consumers in all its big markets.

The maker of Lucky Strike, Dunhill and Kent cigarettes said revenue fell 9.6% in the nine months to Sept. 30, largely because of currency weakness in its major markets.

BAT said cigarette volumes declined 1% in the period, compared with a fall of 3.2% a year earlier. The company said growth in the Middle East, Pakistan and Ukraine failed to make up for falling demand in Russia, Vietnam and Brazil.

Nikkei Leads Rally in Asian Markets; Shares Jump Following Strong Gains on Wall Street

Japanese stocks surged for a second time this week, rebounding from a big drop Tuesday, while Hong Kong shares gained for a fourth straight day after the government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks for the first time Tuesday.

Asian markets got a boost from a sharp rise in Wall Street shares overnight, driven by strong quarterly results from Apple and news that the European Central Bank is considering further stimulus.

The Nikkei Stock Average led gains in the region, jumping 2.6% to 15195.77, as the dollar moved back above ?107.

The latest read on Japanese exports showed a rise of 6.9% from a year earlier in September, helped by a weaker yen and a surge in output among suppliers of components for Apple몭s new smartphones. Still, Japan몭s trade deficit edged up 1.6% from a year earlier to ?958.3 billion ($8.96 billion), the first increase in three months.

Stocks in Japan have had a rough run lately, with big declines last week sending the Nikkei into correction territory, down more than 10% from a late-September peak. On Tuesday the Nikkei lost 2%, after it gained 4% Monday.

The Nikkei tends to rise when the yen falls, because a weaker yen is generally positive for earnings at Japan몭s exporters. The dollar has backtracked against the yen in October after gaining earlier in the year. Midday Wednesday in New York, the greenback was at ?107.28, up from ?107 late Tuesday.

Shares of Japanese shippers were strong, as the Baltic Dry Index of freight rates rose for a third straight session to a one-month high. Nippon Yusen added 4.3% and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines gained 5.4%.

Sony rose 3.4% following reports it will exit its low-end, emerging-market-oriented smartphone business and on news that activist investor Third Point had sold its Sony stock.

Fujifilm Holdings gained 4.1% after a Nikkei report that the company is likely to book a 20% on-year rise in group operating profit for the April-September fiscal half, to around ?70 billion, as its digital camera business moved out of the red. The firm is also enjoying positive exposure as the developer of Avigan, currently in demand as an Ebola treatment.

Daniel Loeb, Third Point Exit  Sony  Investment

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Daniel Loeb was a persistent thorn in Sony Corp.'s side for more than a year, but the investor's hedge fund, Third Point, no longer has a stake in the troubled technology maker.

After trying and failing to pressure Sony to spin off its entertainment division into a separate company, Loeb gradually lowered Third Point's position. At the time, the activist investor slammed Sony Pictures' greenlighting process for producing expensive flops such as "White House Down" and "After Earth."

Even though Sony did not embrace his suggestions and the company expects to lose more than $2 billion for the fiscal year, it was a profitable investment for Third Point. The hedge fund generated a 20% return on its investment, Loeb wrote in an investor letter.

He also praised Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai for cutting costs, transitioning out of the personal computer business, overhauling its television division and increasing transparency, but did sound a note of caution.

"They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company's fortunes," Loeb wrote.

At one point, Third Point was Sony's largest investor with a 7% stake, but by February had shifted its position between shares and swaps, falling out of the company's top 10 investors.

Loeb also wrote that Third Point had purchased "a significant position" in online auction company eBay during the third quarter, has continued to invest in AliBaba following its public offering last summer, and thinks PayPal has opportunities for growth despite the debut of Apple Pay and increased competition in the mobile retail world.

 Sony  Is Looking to Cut Smartphone Sales Target Again

TOKYO멪Sony is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday, as the business struggles to perform as expected in the face of fierce competition especially in emerging markets.

The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43 million for the 12 months to the end of March 2015. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50 million, which many analysts said was too optimistic.

The planned move stems from Sony몭s plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets.

Sony disappointed investors in September when it announced it would write down ?180 billion ($1.68 billion) of the smartphone segment몭s business value and lowered the earnings forecast for the current business year to a ?230 billion net loss, almost five times what it said previously.

For Sony watchers, the latest plan won몭t come as much of a surprise, as company executives, including chief executive Kazuo Hirai, have been signaling it will downsize its smartphone business in some countries after concluding that introducing entry-level models for emerging markets was a mistake. Sony plans to hold a meeting with investors in November, and Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said details of how it will update the smartphone business plan would be unveiled there.

Sony몭s Xperia smartphone business was once a star player for the company, but is now experiencing trouble. It has been hit by the emergence of Chinese makers of cheap handsets, while it continues to struggle in competition against market leaders such as Apple and Samsung.

The Xperia will remain a core business for the company along with image sensors and the gaming business, but Mr. Yoshida has said at news conferences that the smartphone segment will focus on high-end models and won몭t seek a major share of the global market.

Mr. Hirai said in September that Sony would cut 1,000 employees, or 15% of the global smartphone business workforce, by March. Some analysts said the cut wasn't enough to turn around the segment.

Sony announces its earnings result for the July-September period on Oct. 31. While analysts expect a net loss due to the ?180 billion smartphone charges, they say it is unlikely the company will again revise down the earnings forecast for the year for the company as a whole.

New York hedge-fund firm Third Point LLC, which unsuccessfully sought a partial spinoff of Sony몭s entertainment business, said Tuesday said that it had sold its stake in Sony for a return of nearly 20%, saying in a letter to its investors that 몮more urgency몯 was necessary to 몮definitively turn around the company몭s fortunes.몯

Amgen: $100 Billion Activist Target; Dan Loeb Urges Biotech Firm to Take Steps to Unlock Value

Another $100 billion company is on an activist investor몭s chopping block.

Daniel Loeb몭s Third Point LLC has taken a stake in biotechnology giant Amgen Inc. and wants it to explore breaking in two, according to a letter sent to Third Point몭s investors Tuesday.

The New York hedge-fund firm said it is one of Amgen몭s largest shareholders and has been engaged in constructive talks with the company, which has a market capitalization of roughly $109 billion.

몮We firmly believe that the company is at an inflection point,몯 Third Point said in its letter.

Activist investors this year have called on a number of companies to consider breaking up, including PepsiCo Inc., eBay Inc. and Darden Restaurants Inc. They argue that businesses perform better when they are narrowly focused.

몮It is well established that disparate business units generally benefit from operating separately,몯 Third Point said.

The firm said Amgen can unlock value by streamlining its research-and-development process and cutting its 몮bloated cost structure,몯 but Third Point also wants Amgen몭s board to consider the 몮more radical몯 option of breaking up. Third Point suggested potentially splitting apart the company몭s mature business from its faster-growing operations, an idea proposed earlier by Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges.

In a statement, Amgen said it 몮has always appreciated the perspectives of all of its shareholders, including Third Point, and welcomes constructive input toward our common goal of enhancing shareholder value.몯 The company plans to update investors on its priorities and restructuring plans at an investor day next Tuesday.

Third Point said Amgen몭s stock could get to $218 a share by the end of 2017 if the company completed the work on costs and R&D. But if the company went forward with a split, Third Point believes the stock could be worth $249 a share in two years.

Amgen shares rose 4.8% to close at $144.09 Tuesday, touching an all-time high in the process, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Third Point had a stake in the company. Amgen몭s stock is up 150% over the past three years and 26% this year.

Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., helped pioneer the biotechnology-drugs business, but the medicines that propelled its growth are aging and some are facing the threat of low-cost competition. Robert Bradway, a former Morgan Stanley health-care investment banker, became chief executive in 2012 to help turn around the company. Last year, he orchestrated a $10.4 billion deal to buy Onyx Pharmaceuticals and its blood-cancer drug, Kyprolis.

While some analysts have been disappointed by Kyprolis sales, Amgen is betting that new studies will result in additional uses that can drive more sales.

Meanwhile, the company몭s laboratories have been criticized on Wall Street for failing to find new drugs. Amgen executives believe the company몭s drug pipeline has turned a corner, and they몭ve touted study results from three cancer drugs and two cardiovascular medicines, including a cholesterol-lowering drug that is expected to be a blockbuster seller.

Mr. Bradway in July announced plans to cut costs by closing some facilities and laying off 12% to 15% of Amgen몭s employees. The company has said the cost savings are earmarked for potential sources of new growth, such as the cholesterol drug.

The stock has risen sharply since those announcements, and Third Point applauded the moves on Tuesday.

Amgen is the first new investment Third Point has disclosed since the firm raised $2.5 billion in about two weeks this August. The firm, which now has about $17.5 billion in total assets, told investors it planned to use the cash to take activist stakes in several large companies in the U.S. and abroad.

Amgen isn몭t the only company Third Point has urged to explore a split. The company last year disclosed a stake in Sony Corp. and pushed the company to spin off its entertainment business.

Sony rejected Third Point몭s call for a breakup and instead cut costs and made management changes within the entertainment business. In its letter Tuesday, Third Point praised those moves and said it has sold its Sony stake for a return of nearly 20%, though it said 몮more urgency몯 is necessary to 몮definitively turn around the company몭s fortunes.몯

BOSTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb told investors on Tuesday he urged U.S. biotechnology company Amgen Inc to split into two separate businesses, a move he said could boost its share price by more than 80 percent.

"Our own extensive diligence suggests that a breakup of Amgen is feasible and that purported constraints such as tax strategy and supply chain management can be managed," he said in a quarterly letter sent to investors by his Third Point hedge fund.

Loeb, who ranks among the industry's most closely followed investors - returning an average 17.5 percent per year since 1996 - also said Third Point made new bets on eBay Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, while exiting other holdings such as Sony Corp.

The letter said Amgen, in which Third Point is an investor, has "all the hallmarks of a hidden value situation."

It added that investors would likely welcome a split into what Third Point calls MatureCo and GrowthCo.

Loeb, who has been making more activist bets and is known to lob sharply worded directives at underperforming chief executives, called Amgen CEO Bob Bradway open-minded and receptive to the idea of a split.

Amgen, the world's largest biotech company by sales, needs to improve its research and development evaluation, Third Point said, adding that recent cost cuts did not even scratch the surface.

Amgen said it appreciates the perspectives of all of its shareholders, including Third Point.

"The board and management continually assess Amgen's strategic priorities - and, when appropriate, take action - to set the best path forward to increase shareholder value," the company said.

Amgen has scheduled a business update for investors and analysts on Oct. 28 at which it will provide details on the restructuring plans it announced in July.

Third Point recently created a Scientific and Medical Advisory Board led by oncologist Dr. David Agus, the former doctor of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. The board will help evaluate therapeutic companies and their clinical assets.

The letter also touched on this month's wild equity market swings, which have been partly blamed on hedge funds.

Third Point said it still likes investing in the United States and is betting that "large-cap opportunities with a constructivist angle will become more promising."

The hedge fund had cut its exposures over the last week, but has now taken new positions and returned to stocks it still likes but sold earlier at much higher prices.

Amgen shares rose $6.58, or 4.8 percent, to close at $144.09 on Nasdaq.

Omnicom Group Inc. posted a stronger-than-expected 24% increase in earnings in the third quarter, helped by revenue growth in all markets.

The advertising company has been bolstered by revenue increases across major markets, especially the U.S., despite its failed $35 billion merger with French rival Publicis Group SA earlier this year. The total impact of the abandoned transaction was $9.2 million.

U.S. revenue rose 10% to $2 billion, fueled by media operations. Earlier this year, Omnicom won about $2 billion in new business from well-known brands such as CVS, Johnson & Johnson, Sony and Heinz. International revenue increased 4.7% to $1.73 billion.

Overall, the company posted a profit of $243.8 million, or 95 cents a share, compared with $196 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 7.4% to $3.75 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected per-share earnings of 90 cents and revenue of $3.7 billion.

Organic revenue improved 8.9% in North America and 2.2% in Europe. The company also said organic revenue increased 4.4% in Asia Pacific and 2.5% in Latin America. In Africa and the Middle East, organic revenue jumped 18%

Chinese Smartphones Lift Japan몭s Electronics Business; Japanese Parts Makers Tap Surging Demand; Murata, TDK Benefit

KYOTO, Japan멪China몭s smartphone boom is being fueled by an unlikely source: Japanese parts makers.

Upstart Chinese phone makers like Xiaomi Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. are increasingly undercutting smartphone giants like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. with high-performance, low-cost handsets.

A significant portion of those handsets몭 guts멪as much as 50% by value, in some cases멪is made by Japanese companies like Murata Manufacturing Co. or TDK Corp. Those parts range from displays and Wi-Fi modules to tiny, energy-storing ceramic capacitors.

몮Almost all cellphone manufacturers are our customers,몯 said Tsuneo Murata, president of Murata, which makes capacitors and other components. 몮The pie for the component demand is growing.몯

The parts sales are a rare bright spot in Japan몭s gloomy electronics industry, and China몭s smartphone market멪the world몭s largest and growing at 19% a year, according to Counterpoint Research멪is a big factor. Sales there are being fueled by cutthroat competition among dozens of brands, some of which offer smartphones at less than $100. Lower prices mean smaller budgets for parts, but Japanese suppliers often provide a larger share of components to Chinese brands than to Apple or Samsung, analysts say.

In the second quarter of this year, Xiaomi leapfrogged Apple and Samsung to become the best-selling smartphone provider in China, according to Canalys, a research firm. Counterpoint says Chinese brands will capture about three-quarters of the domestic market this year, in terms of volume, up from one-third in 2010.

Chinese companies are boosting purchases of Japanese parts as they push beyond the domestic market, in order to upgrade their phones. In some Chinese-branded phones, Japanese suppliers provide up to half of the parts by value, said Daiki Takayama, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.

Another Chinese smartphone maker, ZTE Corp., buys displays from Sharp Corp. of Japan for its high-end phones, along with camera modules from Sony Corp., said Lu Qianhao, head of the company몭s handset marketing strategy. He cited technological know-how, manufacturing expertise and quality control as advantages of Japanese suppliers.

By contrast, Japanese suppliers account for about one-third of the bill of materials for the latest iPhones, and less than that for Samsung phones, said Shoji Sato, an analyst at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.

Even phone-screen maker Japan Display Inc., whose shares plunged last week after it predicted a loss this fiscal year because of delays in shipments to Apple, says that it expects sales to Chinese smartphone makers to nearly triple to ?180 billion ($1.68 billion) during the same period.

Japan Display makes liquid-crystal displays for smartphones and tablet computers, one of the most competitive areas in the parts business, in which rivals like LG Display Co. of South Korea have been making inroads. Suppliers like Murata that dominate hard-to-copy niches are doing better.

Murata, which is based in Kyoto, built on a long tradition of ceramics-making in Japan몭s former capital to hone its specialization in capacitors and related components.

The company몭s latest capacitors are not much bigger than a grain of sand, but they contain about 100 layers of ceramics, and Murata uses proprietary machines and methods to make them.

몮It몭s like making a good mille-feuille,몭몭 Mr. Takayama said. 몮You can buy a very high-quality egg, the best vanilla essence or whatever, but nobody else knows how to mix it or how long to bake it.몯

Because Murata is the world몭s largest supplier of capacitors for phones, with a 35% share, it can assure manufacturers of a reliable supply, analysts say. That is important given the tight schedules of the smartphone business.

Capacitors cost pennies or less, but state-of-the-art handsets contain 700 to 800 of them멪three or four times as many as in previous generations of smartphones, the company says.

Mr. Sato estimated that Murata sells $2 to $3 worth of parts to most Chinese smartphone makers per handset. Given that Xiaomi alone has forecast shipments of 60 million phones in 2014 and 100 million next year, that is a solid source of revenue. Apple, which uses more capacitors, as well as other parts that Chinese makers don몭t generally source from Murata, buys about $9 to $10 worth of Murata parts for every iPhone, Mr. Sato estimated.

Murata몭s sales of parts to smartphone makers and other suppliers of communications gear rose about 90% over the past five years, to ?430 billion in the year ended March 31, boosting overall sales by about 60%, to ?847 billion.

The Kyoto area, also home to parts makers like Rohm Semiconductor, Nidec Corp. and Kyocera Corp., has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Chinese smartphone boom. TDK, which is based in Tokyo and makes capacitors and other parts, says its sales to Chinese smartphone makers rose 50% in the April-June quarter.

The push to automate smartphone assembly plants in China, including those making phones for non-Chinese brands, is providing a further boost to Japanese suppliers. Fanuc Corp., a maker of industrial robots that is based in the shadow of Mount Fuji, in September sharply upgraded its forecast for sales and earnings in the financial year ending in March by 29% and 26%, respectively.

Katsushi Saito, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said increased orders for plants owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which operates under the trade name Foxconn Technology Group and is a major assembler of Apple and Xiaomi phones, was the likely reason.

A spokesman for Fanuc said he couldn몭t disclose the names of the company몭s clients. Apple didn몭t respond to a request for comment. Xiaomi and Foxconn declined to comment.

Much of the growth in demand for parts this year was linked to China몭s rollout of high-speed networks and the handsets that operate on them.

Japanese parts suppliers have also benefited from the recent weakness of the Japanese yen, which reduces a price gap with competitors in South Korea and China.

Like other parts suppliers, Murata is looking beyond the boom in Chinese smartphones to new markets like wearable technology, as well as existing industries with a growing appetite for precision electronics parts, such as the automotive and health-care businesses, Mr. Murata said.

Globalfoundries to Take Over IBM Chip Unit; IBM Will Pay Globalfoundries $1.5 Billion to Take Chip Operations off its Hands

Globalfoundries Inc. has agreed to takeover the semiconductor operations of International Business Machines Corp., which is effectively acknowledging the rising cost of chip making is too burdensome.

The two companies did not state the financial details of the transaction, but IBM will pay Globalfoundries $1.5 billion to take the chip operations off its hands, according to a person familiar with the situation.

The big technology company has long had losses on its semiconductor operations, which produce chips for IBM computers and for some external customers. IBM began talking to potential buyers early this year, with Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. as well as Globalfoundries participating in the discussions, people familiar with the matter said last spring.

IBM initially hoped to sell the operations for more than $2 billion, the people said, but bidders were coming in closer to $1 billion. Talks with Globalfoundries at times were marked by disagreements over financial terms, one person familiar with the talks said.

Though IBM has been a pioneer in advancing semiconductor technology, the company몭s manufacturing capability fell behind others that produced chips in large volume. IBM for years produced chips used in videogame consoles but lost that business for the latest generations of hardware from Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.

G. Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at VLSI Research, said one likely reason for IBM to pay Globalfoundries in the transaction is the cost of either operating IBM facilities to produce the specialized chips it needs for its computers or adapting Globalfoundries factories to make them.

Still, 몮you would think that IBM would have gotten cash for it, not the other way around,몯 Mr. Hutcheson said.

Globalfoundries, which manufactures chips to order for other companies, emerged as the most likely candidate in part because of geography. Most of the relevant IBM operations are in New York state.

Globalfoundries, which is owned by entities associated with the government of Abu Dhabi, has built a large factory near Albany. It also runs former manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in Germany and plants in Asia that were acquired along with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.

The company몭s chief executive is Sanjay Jha, who took the job in January. He had previously run Motorola Mobility LLC and had served for years as a senior executive of Qualcomm Inc.

IBM produces chips from plants in East Fishkill, N.Y., and Burlington, Vt.

몬Fury몭 Chases Away 몬Gone Girl몭 at Box Office; World War II Drama Took in $23.5 Million, Leading a Cluster of Weak Debuts for Several New Films

Three films catering to three different audiences premiered at the box office this weekend, but none turned out enough viewers to qualify as a runaway hit.

The World War II drama 몮Fury몯 rolled into the top spot with an estimated $23.5 million, while the animated film 몮The Book of Life몯 collected $17 million to take third place. The latest adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks romance novel, 몮The Best of Me,몯 opened with few sparks itself, grossing $10.2 million in a fifth-place debut.

몮Fury,몯 starring Brad Pitt as a tank commander in the final days of the war, opened lower than some expected, but could benefit from the longer shelf life typically seen for adult dramas at movie theaters. Its opening is comparable to that of 몮The Monuments Men,몯 another World War II drama that went on to gross $78 million earlier this year.

몮Fury,몯 released by Sony Corp.몭s Columbia Pictures and co-financed by QED International, had a final cost of about $68 million.

몮People who might not have been the target audience are quite surprised by the film,몯 said Rory Bruer, Sony몭s president of worldwide distribution. About 60% of the opening-weekend audience were men.

몮The Book of Life,몯 which sets a romance against the Mexican holiday of D?a de Los Muertos, is the second feature film from the Reel FX Inc. animation studio and had a budget of $50 million. Produced by Guillermo del Toro and featuring the voices of Channing Tatum and Zoe Saldana, the movie received an A- grade from audiences, according to the CinemaScore market research firm.

The movie was distributed by Twentieth Century Fox, whose parent company, 21st Century Fox Inc., was until recently part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.

The opening for 몮Best of Me몯 is the worst yet for the Nicholas Sparks brand. 몮Best of Me,몯 distributed by Relativity Media LLC with a budget of $26 million, stars James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan as star-crossed high school sweethearts who rekindle a romance years later.

The weak opening for 몮Best of Me몯 is an outlier among adaptations of the author몭s romance novels, which have been reliable box-office performers since 2004몭s 몮The Notebook몯 grossed $81 million and went on to become a cultural juggernaut thanks to a second life on cable and home video. But the opening for 몮The Best of Me몯 is less than half of that seen in the debut weekend of Relativity몭s last Nicholas Sparks release, last year몭s 몮Safe Haven.몯

몮We have had great success with Nicholas Sparks over the years and are always glad to be in business with him,몯 a Relativity spokesperson said, adding the studio expects the film to play well in coming weeks.

Meanwhile, Fox몭s holdover hit 몮Gone Girl몯 collected an additional $17.8 million, bringing its three-week total to $107.1 million.

Director Jason Reitman몭s 몮Men, Women & Children,몯 a look at social-media mores released by Viacom Inc.몭s Paramount Pictures, didn몭t connect with audiences upon wide release, grossing only $320,000 in 608 locations.

Streaming-Platform Roku Wants to Sell Video Ads

Video-streaming platform Roku already distributes content from more than 1,800 different partners through set-top boxes and connected TVs. Now it wants to sell video ads alongside that content, too.

Since the beginning of the year, the company has been quietly building its own video ad network; aggregating inventory from a range of the 몮channels몯 available on its platform, packaging it and offering it up for sale to marketers and agencies. It몭s a model reminiscent of the one commonly employed by cable-TV companies, whereby cable-TV networks typically allow their distribution partners to sell two or three minutes of their ad time each hour.

몮There are lots of ad-supported business models coming onto our platform now. We decided there was a lot more work we could be doing to help our partners with monetization,몯 Scott Rosenberg, Roku몭s vice president of business development, said in an interview.

Major ad-supported channels on Roku currently include Hulu, Vevo, Sony-backed Crackle, and those operated by major networks such as Fox, CBS, A&E, and the History Channel, for example. Mr. Rosenberg declined to disclose which channels Roku currently sells ads for, per its agreements with those companies, but said it represents ad space for both large and small channels on its platform.

According to Mr. Rosenberg, Roku works carefully alongside its partners몭 sales teams to avoid any conflict, but its proposition is different to what its channel partners offer. Marketers can몭t usually work with Roku to buy their way into specific shows, for example. Rather, Roku sells packages of ad space that it promises will reach a specific audience demographic across multiple channels. Its own data can be used to help inform those ad placements, it says.

몮Generally we몭re not interested in selling specific channels or content. Our pitch is scale,몯 he said. 몮Brands and agencies are often looking for broad-based buys across multiple channels on Roku.몯

Mobile App Snapchat

Launches Advertisements

Snapchat, the mobile app that lets users send vanishing messages, introduced ads to its service this weekend.

In a blog post published Friday, the company said it will place an ad in the 몮Recent Updates몯 section of its application.

몮The best advertisements tell you more about stuff that actually interests you. Some companies spend a lot of time and collect a lot of data about you to figure that out,몯 the blog post read, adding, 몮The product we몭re releasing today is a lot simpler. An advertisement will appear in your Recent Updates from time to time, and you can choose if you want to watch it. No biggie. It goes away after you view it or within 24 hours, just like Stories.몯

Snapchat said it won몭t place ads in users몭 personal communications, and that they won몭t be 몮creepy and targeted,몯 referencing the behaviorally informed ads now sold by the vast majority of online advertising and media companies.

And in case there was any doubt as to why Snapchat is introducing ads, 몮We need to make money,몯 the company몭s post explained.

Programmatic Spending

Is Expected to Increase

Automated or 몮programmatic몯 display ad spending in the U.S. will grow 137.1% in 2014, representing $10 billion in total spend or 45% of the U.S. digital display ad market, according to new predictions by eMarketer.

By 2016 over $20 billion of ads will be purchased through programmatic ad systems, eMarketer reckons, accounting for 63% of all ad dollars spent on digital display ads.

In 2014, mobile programmatic will account for 44% of total US display ad spending, growing to 56.2% in 2015. Programmatic video ad investment is expected to grow at a slower rate, however. By 2016, just 40% of digital video ads will be purchased programmatically, eMarketer said.

Brad Pitt's 'Fury' all the rage at U.S., Canada box office

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Brad Pitt's gritty World War Two drama "Fury" conquered all box office foes over the weekend, ringing up $23.5 million in ticket sales at theaters in the United States and Canada.

"Fury" kicked two-time box office leader "Gone Girl" into second place, with the thriller, which stars Ben Affleck, collecting $17.8 million from Friday through Sunday, according to data from tracking firm Rentrak.

Animated movie "The Book of Life" earned the No. 3 spot, with a debut of $17 million.

In "Fury", Pitt plays a hardened war veteran who leads men overcome by fatigue and traveling by tank in Nazi Germany during the final months of World War II. Actors Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena and Logan Lerman also star in the film.

"Gone Girl", the big-screen adaptation of a best-selling book, features Affleck as a writer who becomes a suspect when his wife disappears.

"The Book of Life" draws on Mexican art and wooden puppets to animate a colorful love story rooted in the Mexican Day of the Dead festivities. It follows childhood friends Manolo (Diego Luna), Joaquin (Channing Tatum) and Maria (Zoe Saldana).

'Fury' Enters New Battle Zone: The Oscar Race

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Sony's "Fury" arrives in theaters Friday with critical approval and positive box office predictions. As for awards, the WWII drama's outstanding artisan work could enlist it in this year's race.

Writer-director David Ayer and his team - including cinematographer Roman Vasyanov, production designer Andrew Menzies, composer Steve Price, editors Jay Cassidy and Dody Dorn, hair/makeup person Alessandro Bertolazzi, supervising sound editor, Paul N.J. Ottoson, and sound mixer Lisa Pinero - are likely to stir up enthusiasm within the guilds, as well as from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences' below-the-line branches.

Beyond that? It depends on the quality of the upcoming, unseen, films. But word of mouth on "Fury's" below-the-line work will encourage voters in other guilds and AMPAS categories to see the film, which is an important factor during these months when voters are being flooded with viewing options.

Logan Lerman seems an outside possibility in the supporting-actor contest; Brad Pitt, despite a strong performance, may have too subtle a role for this year's crowded actor race.

After its domestic launch, "Fury" makes its European bow Sunday as the closer of the BFI London Film Festival. The dates are similar to Sony's rollout last year for "Captain Phillips," smart timing that gave voters an opportunity to see the film in advance of the fourth-quarter rush of contenders. "Captain Phillips" scored six Oscar noms, including best picture.

Considering the current headlines, will a war film be a tough sell to voters? Sony needs to remind folks that they may have seen a lot of Yanks-vs-Nazis films, but this one is different, thanks to Ayer's meticulous filmmaking. Yes, it's about war, but it's also about fellowship, compassion and faith, and it keeps the adrenaline pumping as it weighs these matters.

Another possible advantage: World War II is part of Hollywood's DNA.

Exhibit A: Even before Pearl Harbor, studio toppers ordered scripts to stir up public support for the war. During the war and in the 70 years since, it's been the setting for a gazillion films, much more than any other war before or since. Exhibit B: Eight WWII movies have won best picture (and that's not counting "The Sound of Music" and "The King's Speech," where the war was background, but key to the plot). In comparison, the best-pic roster includes just three for WWI, two for Vietnam, one for the Civil War, one for the Mideast, and zero for endless other wars throughout history.

That familiarity could be a liability, but in the case of "Fury," it's an asset. Audiences (and voters) bring immediate emotional connections to WWII, but not too much connection (latter is the case with depictions of Mideast conflicts). We don't need heavy exposition for WWII; heroes and villains are clear-cut. In addition, the look and battle methods of WWII seem more cinematic than most other wars (in the same way that boxing is for some reason more movie-friendly than skiing or tennis).

A trio of films this year - "Fury," "The Imitation Game" and "Unbroken," not to mention the pre-war "The Grand Budapest Hotel" - are reminders that there are still new ways to tell WWII stories. Like the heroes in "Fury," the team is fighting for survival in a chaotic situation. But the Ayer force may save the day.

UPDATE 3-Online growth prospects help Japan's Recruit shine in market debut

* Shares up 7.4 pct as broader market slips

* Recruit is one of the world's top 5 staffing firms

* Adept at turning publishing businesses into web products

* Other major listings in Tokyo this year have flopped (Updates closing share price)

By Thomas Wilson

TOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Staffing firm Recruit Holdings Co Ltd surged in its market debut in Tokyo on Thursday, with investors leaping at a rare opportunity to grab part of a big Japanese company with strong online growth prospects.

The 7 percent climb in its share price came amid a decline for the overall market and snapped a string of weak high-profile listings in Tokyo this year. It values the company at around $18 billion - on par with Sony Corp and more than Switzerland's Adecco, the world's biggest staffing firm by sales.

Particularly appealing for investors is Recruit's wide range of businesses including magazines and its aggressive expansion both overseas and into web-based products like real estate listings and second-hand car sales.

"It has been able to meld its traditional publishing business with its web-based products well and that implies high prospects for growth," said Masayuki Doshida, a senior market analyst at Rakuten Securities.

Doshida cited travel magazine Jalan as one such example. It now has its own website offering customers the ability to book travel tickets, hotels and rent cars across Japan.

A tightening labour market as Japan's population rapidly ages and a shift by companies towards using more temporary workers is also expected to work in Recruit's favour.

ACQUISITION HUNGRY

Its shares closed at 3,330 yen, compared with an IPO price of 3,100 yen.

Its IPO, the second-largest in Japan this year, raised roughly $2 billion, with about half of those funds going to the company for further acquisitions and half to existing shareholders.

With ambitions to become the world's biggest staffing firm by 2020, Recruit has in recent years snapped up rivals such as U.S. staffing service CSI, Advantage Resourcing and Staffmark Holdings as well as Indeed.com.

It has over 100 human resources affiliates, roughly evenly split between Japan and overseas.

But the global staffing market is highly fragmented and in terms of just staffing-related revenue, Recruit ranked no. 5 in the world in 2012 with a 1.5 percent market share. That compares to 6.5 percent for Adecco, according to Staffing Industry Analysts.

The bigger market cap for Recruit may lie in its higher profit margins. Its margin for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the last financial year was 15 percent, compared to around 5 percent for Adecco.

Founded in 1960 by Hiromasa Ezoe, a Tokyo University student, Recruit grew rapidly but stumbled in the late 1980s, when it became the centre of a shares-for-favors corruption scandal that brought down the Japanese government.

Recruit made 1.2 trillion yen ($11 billion) in operating revenue in the past financial year, an increase of 13.6 percent, helped by its Indeed.com unit and a favourable exchange rate. But net income declined 9 percent as operating expenses increased.

Weak listings on the Tokyo bourse this year included a $3 billion offering by smartphone screen maker Japan Display that suffered as investors fretted about falling product prices and its ability to compete in Asia.

A $700 million IPO by restaurant chain Skylark Co this month also received a lukewarm welcome as its longer-term growth prospects are less than clear and the listing was seen primarily as an opportunity for owner Bain Capital to cash out.

Japan Display Shares Drop 18%; Outlook Downgrade Blamed on Market Competition, Shipment Delays to Apple Inc.

TOKYO멪Shares of Japan Display Inc. sank 18% Thursday, just a day after it announced a much bigger downward revision to its earnings outlook than analysts had expected.

After the market closed Wednesday, Japan Display said it now predicted a loss of ?10 billion ($95 million) in the year ending in March, instead of a ?26.8 billion net profit previously expected. It blamed fierce market competition and delays of shipments to Apple Inc., whose business accounts for nearly one-third of Japan Display몭s revenue.

몮The magnitude of earnings revisions was much larger than expected,몯 J.P. Morgan analyst Narci Chang wrote in a letter to clients. The brokerage slashed the company몭s price target to ?350 from ?770, putting it at underweight. 몮We expect share price momentum to stay weak,몯 Ms. Chang wrote.

Shares of the world몭s leading display maker fell 18.22% to ?359 at the market close from the previous day. They listed at ?900 on the Tokyo exchange in March this year.

Japan Display was formed two years ago through a merger of the LCD units of Sony Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp., with the help of the government-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, which owns a 35% stake.

A Japan Display official who asked not to be named said the company couldn몭t secure enough parts to produce displays with the quality requested by Apple. That was consistent with what analysts had been saying, noting that production of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is more than six weeks behind schedule.

Also weighing on Japan Display몭s earnings was a one-time cost of ?7 billion from the planned closure of an inefficient factory in Saitama prefecture north of Tokyo.

Many investors had expected the firm to slash its earnings forecast given the severe competition, especially in the Chinese market. But they said they hadn몭t anticipated the scale of the cut. That is leading to uncertainty about the company몭s ability to accurately forecast its business outlook.

몮Given the very low credibility of its guidance, the stock may have further downside risk,몯 said Jefferies equity analyst Atul Goyal, noting that Wednesday몭s cut was fourth since the company몭s initial public offering.

In its statement, the Tokyo-based manufacturer said business would be better in the second half of the fiscal year thanks to expected increases in shipments to China and other Asian markets, although that wouldn몭t offset the poor first half.

SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Yukihiko Shimada said, 몮Sales projections for the second half are somewhat bullish, and may come in short.몯

Japan Display몭s setback is the latest example of the difficulties Japanese manufactures are having staying profitable in a highly volatile market, even with efforts to become more cost-efficient.

Miles Beyond the Biopic: Don Cheadle Riffs on a Jazz Legend

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Don Cheadle has managed to accomplish something no one has been able to pull off in two decades: serve up a bigscreen tale of jazz great Miles Davis.

"Miles Ahead," in which the versatile actor portrays the legendary trumpeter, marks the directorial debut of Cheadle, who co-wrote the script. The independently financed production, made for $8.5 million, wrapped a monthlong shoot in Cincinnati in mid-August, capping a lengthy gestation period for a project that began eight years ago with Davis' posthumous induction into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.

The picture, which has yet to score a U.S. distributor, is among a number of film endeavors centering on iconic black musicians - all of them divisive figures who were considered ahead of their time, with none of the films so far connecting with a wide audience. Most recently, "Jimi: All Is by My Side," starring Andre Benjamin (aka Outkast's Andre 3000) as Jimi Hendrix, bowed quietly Sept. 26, and has grossed less than $300,000 to date. "Get On Up," the $30 million James Brown biopic, received a similarly chilly reception, despite major studio support (Universal), grossing little more than its budget since its Aug. 1 debut. Alex Gibney's low-earning documentary "Finding Fela!" about Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, opened in limited release in early August.

"Nina," which stars Zoe Saldana as troubled pianist-singer Nina Simone - who like Davis could not be pinned to a specific musical genre - appears to be in a holding pattern, despite being shown to potential distributors at Cannes in May. The movie has been embroiled in controversy ever since it was announced that Saldana, a light-skinned beauty of Dominican descent, would play Simone.

And there will no doubt be legions of naysayers who will object to the way the Davis story is told, given the kind of fanatical following such artists tend to cultivate.

"Miles Davis is a hugely significant figure, perhaps one of the most important musicians and cultural figures of the 20th Century," says Todd Boyd, professor of critical studies at USC who specializes in the study of race and popular culture. "So attempting to reduce someone's life like Miles into a two-hour film is a challenge in and of itself."

Bryce Duffy for Variety Davis' career spanned some 50 years, and the highlights are many, from his pioneering "Birth of the Cool" sessions starting in 1949, to his first quintet with John Coltrane in the '50s, his orchestral collaborations with Gil Evans later in the decade, the second great quintet with Herbie Hancock in the '60s, and his electro-funk Prince of Darkness phase.

Cheadle's take on Davis, co-written with Steven Baigelman, leans toward the more conceptual, juxtaposing two periods in the trumpeter's life. "The central story takes place in two days, before he made his comeback (in 1980)," Cheadle says. The "B story," as he calls it, reflects back to 1956-66, which parallels Davis' relationship with his first wife, dancer Frances Taylor Davis. "She's sort of the one that got away," Cheadle explains, "the love of his life." Saldana was originally identified to play Frances, but the role ultimately went to Emayatzy Corinealdi (Sundance hit "The Middle of Nowhere").

Sets and locations in Cincinnati double for Davis' New York Brownstone, the office of Columbia Records executive George Butler, and for performance spaces in the flashback sequences that could make up as much as 40% of the film.

The filmmakers are adamant that "Miles Ahead" not be considered a biopic, but rather an interpretation of what made the trumpeter tick. "It's like wall-to-wall truth, not wall-to-wall facts," explains Cheadle, who says the script ideas he rejected were too traditional in tone, and too aggressive in scope. "We're much closer to something like historical fiction, where this is a composition of our making, using Miles as our inspiration, our muse, to tell a story from our perspective."

At the time of Davis' Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2006, his nephew, Vince Wilburn Jr., a producer on the movie, was asked if a Miles Davis film was in the works. And, as Cheadle recalls now - adding that he didn't know it then - Wilburn had said, " 'Yes, and Don Cheadle's going to play him.'"

Wilburn, who played a role in coaxing the man he calls "Uncle Miles" out of retirement in 1980, confirms the story. "We just knew (Cheadle) would fit," he says, calling the actor's performance "his interpretation; his spin." Adds Erin Davis, the trumpeter's son and also a producer on the feature: "I can say that the direction of the film is going to be what Miles would have liked."

There are many reasons Miles Davis stopped performing and recording in 1974, including serious health issues, creative burnout, continued hostility from critics who refused to embrace his electronic music, and perhaps just an old-fashioned midlife crisis (Davis was about to turn 50 at the time, corresponding with Cheadle's current age).

"Miles had this incredible facility and ability to move to the next thing and the next thing, and not play it safe and not repeat himself," says Cheadle, whose swaggering self-confidence and wiry intensity appear to make him the ideal candidate for the role. "When that's exhausted, what do you do? So that to me was a very interesting part of his life."

Cheadle says he sought directing counsel from some of the helmers he's worked with, including Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Carl Franklin and George Clooney, who knows what it's like to juggle roles from behind and in front of the camera.

"I knew it on paper; I knew what our schedule was, which was ambitious to say the least," Cheadle says of the 30-day shoot. "But experience is the real kicker when you're on the set. It's like, 'Wow, OK, there's no pause' - and trying to do things that are in some ways diametrically opposed; trying to be immersed in the acting but also have some sort of 10,000-foot perspective."

Bryce Duffy for Variety The filmmakers are cagey about what other real-life figures will be depicted in the movie or how much performance footage will be included - pretty much keeping anything other than the story's broad strokes under wraps. Ewan McGregor reportedly will play a Rolling Stone reporter, loosely based on a real-life person who inadvertently gets Miles out of his isolation, according to Cheadle. That reporter very well could be David Breskin (though Cheadle elaborates by calling the character "an amalgam"), who gained significant access to Davis during and after his seclusion, based on the Jack Chambers biography of Davis, entitled "Milestones."

Cheadle says he neither glossed over nor dwelled on Davis' dissolute lifestyle, including excessive cocaine abuse and certain misogynistic tendencies, which the trumpeter described with blunt candor in his autobiography "Miles." "We're dealing with everything," he says. "But it's not the point of that period."

A warts-and-all treatment of a pop figure can be problematic when negotiating for rights with that talent's estate. Biopics on Charlie Parker ("Bird"), Ray Charles ("Ray") and Johnny Cash ("Walk the Line") managed to navigate through all the speed bumps. But long-in-the-works films on Janis Joplin and Marvin Gaye, to name just two, seem no closer to realization now than when they were first announced several years ago.

Cooperation of estates that control the artist's likeness, access to personal archives and, in the case of the Davis family, music publishing rights, is key. The cost of licensing the music alone can be a deal-breaker, although "Jimi" managed to skirt the issue by avoiding any music Hendrix wrote himself. "Miles Ahead" is benefitting from the full cooperation of the Davis estate, controlled by Wilburn, Davis' kids Erin and Cheryl Davis, and Darryl Porter, general manager of Miles Davis Properties. The estate controls publishing rights to Davis' music, while Sony owns the master recordings for much of the period covered in the movie. "Columbia and Sony have been very generous in giving us things at a price that doesn't break the bank," Cheadle says, "but we absolutely have had to pay for it."

The estate has aggressively marketed all things Miles since his death in 1991, assisting Sony with exhaustive boxed CD/DVD sets, publishing an art book showcasing Davis' paintings, and peddling Miles-themed merchandise and mounting annual treks to SXSW to further fan the flame among younger audiences. Porter says Davis "is best-known for being a musician, although we claim he's a lifestyle."

Many of these Davis collectibles were offered as incentives to those who contributed to crowdfunding service Indiegogo to help raise more than $343,000 in gap financing for the film. According to Indiegogo's head of film, Marc Hoffstatter, the 2,000-plus funders were driven by social media, with Cheadle boasting some 240,000 Twitter followers, and the Miles Davis website claiming almost two million likes on Facebook. Cheadle invested his own money in the production, but wouldn't reveal how much. The rest was covered via independent financing from Bifrost Pictures, with a favorable Ohio tax rebate. IM Global handled foreign pre-sales.

Herbie Hancock's involvement in the film has been described as everything from serving as a consultant to a technical advisor, although he describes his role as non-specific. Whatever original music is being done for the film is from jazz crossover artist Robert Glasper. "The only music I've heard so far is what Robert has done," says Hancock, who was drawn into the project in its very early stages. "It sampled some ideas that Don had discussed with me earlier."

Adds Cheadle: "Robert Glasper is kind of taking point on actually creating the music and playing that music. Herbie is kind of our shepherd and godfather, making sure we don't fall off the beam."

Telling the Miles Davis story has baffled Hollywood for at least 20 years. Former Columbia Records chief Walter Yetnikoff announced a planned biopic in 1993, starring Wesley Snipes. But despite securing rights to Davis' autobiography, and talking with Spike Lee about directing, the Yetnikoff project, tentatively titled "Million Dollar Lips," fell through, and his option lapsed. Producer Marvin Worth ("Lenny," "Malcolm X") picked up the thread from there, but his death in 1998 halted further progress.

After the Davis estate hooked up with Cheadle, it shopped the idea to the studios, but ultimately decided to take the independent route. "I always felt that if we could do it with creative control, where people like Don could see it through in his own vision, we would have a focused direction," Erin Davis says.

Wilburn gets more specific. "Hollywood didn't buy it," he says. "I stopped going to the pitches, because it was too frustrating to try to convince people who Miles Davis is."

For his part, Hancock is confident that Cheadle's take on Davis properly captures the musician's spirit. "It's not a documentary of Miles Davis' life," he says. "It's a story that's got its inspiration from Miles' music -- that kind of in-the-moment creative flow that Miles had. The thing I like about that type of approach is that we don't have to worry about people saying, 'Wait a minute, it didn't happen this way.'"

But Boyd, who has read the script, is skeptical. "It seems as though the period of time that they picked - the late '70s - is probably the least significant era of Miles' music," he says. "If this film actually does make it to the screen, there's the likelihood that we won't see any more Miles Davis biopics any time soon. And so the legacy of Miles Davis is resting thus far on this one film, and I don't think based on what I've seen, this film serves the purpose of properly representing what Miles Davis represented to American music and American culture."

Cheadle is more concerned with making a movie that's entertaining than with giving a history lesson. "I don't think the movie can tarnish the legacy," he says. "To me, Miles' legacy is his music."

For its part, the Davis family seems anything but displeased by what has transpired. "I want people to understand how complex he was," Erin Davis says about his expectations of the film, "and I want them to leave the movie wanting to know more."

Cheadle is well aware of the tremendous risks involved. "I know I'm dancing in a minefield on this one," he says, "but I'd own it."
