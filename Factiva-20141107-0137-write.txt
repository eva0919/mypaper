LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - After a heated bidding war that had most of the majors vying for it over the weekend, Open Road has won the U.S. rights to the untitled spec revolving around the Edward Snowden story that has Oliver Stone directing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt starring.
As Deadline Hollywood reported earlier in the week, studio execs first received the script Friday afternoon with the first offers coming in sometime that evening. Wild Bunch has nabbed the international rights.
Stone is writing and directing and will produce with Eric Kopeloff and Moritz Borman.
Snowden's story is now familiar to most: the former U.S. intelligence analyst released more classified documents than anyone since Daniel Ellsberg's leaking of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. He has been on the run ever since.
Stone acquired the rights to the book "Time of the Octopus" by Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, which is considered the closest thing to a documented account of the events since Snowden first released the documents.
Production would likely begin at the end of the year or in the early first quarter of 2015, which is a good thing given that this isn't the only Snowden project in town. Sony already has the rights to "No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State" with the James Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli of EON Productions producing the pic.
Deadline first broke the Open Road news.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Season five of Jerry Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" on Sony's Crackle digital network bowed Thursday, with the premiere featuring Kevin Hart and Jerry tooling around in a 1959 Porsche RSK Spyder on a "weird male date."
The latest season of the show -- which Crackle has said is its most-popular content with more than 70 million views to date -- will also feature episodes with NBC's "The Tonight Show" host Jimmy Fallon, Amy Schumer, Fred Armisen, Bill Burr, Ali Wentworth and YouTube star Miranda Sings, the awkward character created by comedian and singer Colleen Ballinger.
The first episode of season five of "Comedian in Cars Getting Coffee" includes a guest appearance by former "Seinfeld" cast-mate Michael Richards as "Dick Corcoran," the cigar-chomping president of Crackle who tells Jerry the network is going bankrupt because of what it's spending on the cars-and-coffee series. Season five will run seven episodes in all.
The webseries costs about $100,000 per episode to produce, Seinfeld told David Letterman this summer in an interview at the Paley Center for Media in New York.
Seinfeld is executive producer of "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee," produced by Sony Pictures Television's Embassy Row.

Pay-TV 몬Cord Cutting몭 Accelerates; Subscriber Defections Begin to Hit Satellite TV; Price of Bills Cited

The pay-TV industry contracted in the third quarter at a faster pace than a year earlier, signaling that 몮cord cutting몯 is accelerating as more consumers drop cable and satellite-TV connections.
Overall, the pay-TV industry lost about 179,000 TV customers, a steeper loss from the decline of 83,000 in the year-earlier quarter, according to public company reports and estimates from Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson LLC. Already, more homes and businesses have dropped pay-TV service in the first three quarters of this year than in the whole of last year, MoffettNathanson estimates.
Subscriber defections came at all the major cable and satellite-TV providers, including Comcast Corp. and DirecTV. On Thursday, Cablevision Systems Corp. said it lost 56,000 video customers, bringing its total to roughly 2.7 million.
Cablevision Chief Executive James Dolan acknowledged the shifting winds in the industry as 몮over the top몯 streaming video services lure customers away from traditional pay TV. 몮Ultimately cord-cutting and going to over the top is something we do believe is going to happen and we are preparing ourselves for it,몯 he said, noting the company몭s investments in its broadband network. Cablevision on Thursday reported a 3.7% increase in revenue thanks to rate increases and higher advertising revenue.
Video customer bases shrank at satellite-TV providers as well, which is unusual in a quarter where they typically grow. For years, satellite-TV companies posted gains by taking customers from cable providers, but in the third quarter they lost 40,000 subscribers, compared to a gain of 174,000 a year ago. 몮Growth is hitting a wall,몯 said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, conjecturing that the increasing importance of broadband may finally be starting to weigh on satellite providers몭 results.
DirecTV, long known for its operational expertise and premium brand, said Thursday that it lost 28,000 customers in the quarter. The company also said it is experiencing a higher volume of customer calls relating to the amount of the bill, as people become more price-sensitive in a discount-heavy environment. Customers who leave are 몮mentioning price-value and I see more of them claiming they몭re going to no pay TV,몯 said DirecTV Chief Executive Mike White on an earnings conference call. Indeed, several pay TV providers including DirecTV and Cablevision say their subscriber losses were driven in part by their own strategies to let discount-seeking customers fall to the wayside, focusing instead on attracting 몮higher value몯 subscribers willing to pay more.
DirecTV also said the percentage of its customers defecting to cable edged up.
The net contraction for the wider industry was driven by the weaker performance of satellite companies and slower growth at the TV operations of telecom providers Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., which together added a combined 330,000, versus 400,000 in the year-ago quarter.
Cable-TV companies actually slowed video customer losses from an estimated 657,000 losses last year to 469,000, thanks in part to more customers choosing newer, cheaper bundles of slimmed-down pay-TV offerings with fast broadband.
The pay-TV industry is under assault from multiple sides. While some customers are cutting the cord entirely, others are simply 몮shaving몯 it by switching to smaller channel packages that cost less. Many operators are aggressively marketing such offerings, figuring it is better to make less revenue off those customers than lose them altogether. Others, including DirecTV and Dish Network Corp., are jumping into the streaming game with their own online video services to be released this year, aimed at households that don몭t subscribe to pay television.
The pay-TV industry몭s contraction has major implications for TV channel-owners, too. Their growth is increasingly powered by the subscription fees they receive from pay-TV operators, especially given softness in the advertising market.
Pay-TV and media executives broadly acknowledge that some people are dropping their pay-TV subscriptions, but many maintain it몭s still a marginal loss given that the overall U.S. market has about 100 million pay-TV homes.
A host of new streaming launches in coming quarters will test the strength of the traditional pay-TV ecosystem. Sony Corp., for example, has said it plans to debut an online video service by the end of the year. Time Warner Inc.몭s HBO and CBS Corp.몭s Showtime have plans to launch standalone streaming versions of their premium channels next year. CBS three weeks ago launched a $5.99-per-month service that streams CBS programming live and on-demand, except for NFL football.

City Living Comes to Downtown Nashville; The capital of country is growing more urban with neighborhoods like the Gulch, SoBro and Germantown

The capital of country is getting citified.
Nashville몭s once-sleepy downtown neighborhoods are in the midst of a transformation: Cranes dotting the skyline are constructing high-rise apartments, condos, hotels and office towers. Tourism has gotten a jolt from a popular eponymous television drama, as well as a new $585 million, 2.1 million-square-foot convention center. And the real-estate market is booming, as young adults and empty-nesters flock to new neighborhoods in search of walkability and proximity to the action.
Perhaps the most dramatic turnaround can be seen in the Gulch, formerly a forgotten industrial area that many locals weren몭t familiar with a decade ago. Today, people walk along winding sidewalks with benches and street lamps. There are high-rise and midrise condo and apartment buildings with roof-deck pools and cabanas. Bearded baristas serve artisanal pour-over brews at coffee shops.
Sony Music Nashville recently announced that it would relocate its offices from Nashville몭s Music Row to the Gulch. Developer MarketStreet, which owns much of the property in the neighborhood, said $600 million has been invested in the area so far and another $500 million will be put into residential, retail and office development by MarketStreet and other developers in the coming years
몮Ten years ago멞you never came here. There was nothing here,몯 said Scott Evans, a broker with Parks Urban Real Estate Gallery, which opened an office in the Gulch in 2012 with eight agents. It now has 38. Other downtown neighborhoods like SoBro, south of Broadway and home to the Country Music Hall of Fame, and Germantown, just north of downtown, are on the rise as well.
The population of downtown Nashville nearly quadrupled to 7,685 between 2000 and 2014, compared with 21% growth citywide to about 659,000, according to the Nashville Downtown Partnership. Prices for downtown condos average about $390 a square foot, up from $128 a square foot in 2004, according to the Nashville Downtown Partnership몭s Residential Report.
It몭s a big shift for this southern city that has long been known for neighborhoods of Colonial homes and early 20th-century bungalows. Before 1994, residential development of any kind was barred in most of downtown.
The local economy is booming, boosted partly by the area몭s $30 billion health-care industry. The city몭s gross metro product grew 4.2% in 2013, double the national average, according to an IHS Global report. It is expected to top $100 billion by the end of this year.
Jennifer Lee, a 37-year-old dermatologist who moved to Nashville in 2010 from Boston, said the city몭s new urban landscape made the move easier. She purchased a $356,000, one-bedroom condominium in the Icon, a 424-unit, 22-story building in the Gulch with floor-ceiling windows and an outdoor pool deck. 몮When we moved in, the building was half empty,몯 she said. The neighborhood 몮just exploded in the last year.몯
Jay Turner, a local developer whose family made its fortune creating Dollar General variety stores, and his partners saw that Nashville had fallen behind in the residential-driven urban revival many other U.S. cities had experienced. So 15 years ago their company, MarketStreet, decided to purchase much of the property and vacant lots around the city몭s rail yard.
MarketStreet joined with the city to redo the neighborhood몭s infrastructure and streets and christened the area the Gulch, a historic term for the area that had fallen out of use. In 2002, MarketStreet opened the first residential building, a 32-unit apartment complex. It leased quickly, prompting development of more apartments and condos.
The financial crisis stalled development for a few years, but agents say condo sales have bounced back, with resale prices surpassing their precrash highs. That has prompted developers to move forward with projects like Twelve Twelve, a 286-unit building under construction. Prices in the building range from $375,000 for one-bedrooms to about $3 million for three-bedroom penthouses, potentially a record for Nashville.
Twelve Twelve몭s developer, Ray Hensler, built his previous condominium, the Adelicia, in Midtown, attracting buyers like Taylor Swift and Kelly Clarkson. Standing in an empty 2,000-square-foot penthouse with wide-plank floors, Mr. Hensler said he has shifted his focus to the Gulch, because it 몮has emerged as the most sought-after district.몯
Residents say there are downsides to living in the Gulch. Rail yards bring loud freight trains through the area a couple of times a day. The streetscape of mostly modern buildings lacks the historic, haphazard charm of cities like New York or Chicago. 몮It몭s been amazing to see the transformation,몯 said Megan Youngblood. A 35-year-old who works in systems engineering at Vanderbilt University, she moved out of the Gulch to Germantown a few months ago. But 몮I think the Gulch is trying to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up.몯
Although the neighborhood is set up to be walkable, most residents still commute by car. In 2010, the city started a free shuttle-bus service, and bike share was recently added. Karl Dean, the city몭s mayor, has backed a plan to build an $18 million pedestrian bridge linking the Gulch to SoBro, financed by developers in the Gulch. 몮The Gulch is clearly working, but it몭s separated [from downtown] by the railroad tracks,몯 said Mr. Dean. 몮You gotta connect the dots.몯 The plan received its final approval from the city council last month. Mr. Turner, the developer, said the addition of offices will also promote pedestrian commuting.
Affordability in Nashville is a growing concern. The city has long attracted artists partly because its housing costs are relatively low when compared with other music and performance hubs like Los Angeles and New York. Mr. Dean said the city is encouraging more developments like Ryman Lofts, a 60-unit affordable apartment complex for artists and musicians just south of downtown in Rolling Mill Hill, another up-and-coming area. Rents there start at $582 a month for studios. MarketStreet said its buildings include affordable units, and the company is actively looking into how to add more in the Gulch.
Real-estate agents and developers said their biggest problem is a lack of high-end inventory and larger units that would appeal to older, wealthier buyers. Most of the Gulch몭s apartment and condo complexes are comprised primarily of small one- and two-bedroom units.
Charlyn Jarrells, a 50-year-old Arkansas native who retired early from her job as an executive at Wal-Mart, decided to settle in Nashville after living in Seattle, where she lived in a 38th-floor condo. 몮I loved not having a yard to take care of,몯 she said.
When she came to Nashville, she wanted a place on a high floor with views, but had a hard time finding anything larger than a one-bedroom. So she purchased two adjacent units in the Gulch몭s Icon. She paid about $1 million for both, including a $125,000 credit she could put toward combining them, for a total of about 1,950 square feet of living space. Her unit has wide-plank hardwood floors and views of Ryman Auditorium and the State Capitol from wall-size windows. 몮I could not be happier with where I몭ve landed,몯 she said.
The hunt is already on for the next Gulch. On a recent afternoon, Mark Deutschmann, a real-estate broker and developer, drove around Wedgewood-Houston, a somewhat sparse industrial and residential neighborhood south of downtown. A few art galleries and studios have appeared, including one in an old hosiery mill, as well as recording studios and distilleries.
He purchased an 8? acre parcel for $4.5 million, and plans to break ground on a mixed-use condominium development early next year. 몮It몭s really just starting,몯 he said.

Lenovo몭s Quarterly Profit Jumps 19%; Growth in Europe Helps the PC Maker Shrug Off Declining Revenue in China

HONG KONG멪Lenovo Group Ltd. said Thursday its net profit for the quarter through September rose 19% thanks to growing sales of both personal computers and smartphones.
The world몭s largest PC maker by shipments said net profit rose to $262 million from $220 million a year earlier, largely in line with analysts몭 expectations. Revenue, however, came in below analysts몭 projections, rising 7% to $10.48 billion from $9.77 billion.
Lenovo said revenue in China, its biggest market, decreased 2% in the quarter from a year earlier. But revenue in Europe rose 33%, making up for the slowdown in China.
The company몭s smartphone shipments rose 38% from a year earlier. But revenue from its mobile devices division, which also includes tablets, fell 6%.
Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said the decline in mobile device revenue, despite shipment growth, was partly because many of the phones shipped near the end of the quarter hadn몭t yet contributed to revenue.
Lenovo has a challenge integrating two businesses it bought recently. A week ago, the company said it completed its $2.91 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility from Google Inc., while earlier in October it closed a $2.1 billion deal to buy International Business Machines Corp.몭s low-end server business.
Analysts say Lenovo몭s earnings may be hurt in the coming quarters by costs associated with the integration of the two businesses. Mr. Yang Yuanqing has also warned that the acquisitions will likely weigh on the company몭s bottom line in the near term. Mr. Yang has said he aims to turn loss-making Motorola profitable within six quarters of completing the deal.
Lenovo, which was founded in China, bought IBM몭s PC business in 2005. The company, now based in both China and the U.S., overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. to become the world몭s No. 1 PC maker by shipments last year. As the global PC market has become saturated, Lenovo is seeking new sources of growth by expanding its smartphone and server businesses.
Separately, Lenovo said Thursday that it has appointed Yahoo Inc. co-founder Jerry Yang as an independent board director. Of Lenovo몭s 11-member board, eight are independent directors, including former Sony Corp. Chief Executive Nobuyuki Idei and Tudor Brown, a co-founder of U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings PLC.

Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine몭s School for Innovation; After the runaway success of Beats멪recently bought by Apple for $3 billion멪the duo is launching a new academy at the University of Southern California with the goal of inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs

IF JIMMY IOVINE has a trademark, it몭s his hat. For decades, the record producer turned label boss turned headphones magnate turned all-around music-biz oracle has rarely appeared in public without something atop his head, be it a casual wintry wool knit number or a navy blue baseball cap featuring the logo of his multi-billion-dollar corporation, Beats. What Steve Jobs was to mock turtlenecks or Phil Knight is to the swoosh, Iovine is to hats. And yet, it was still slightly incongruous to see him last May, standing at a podium in front of the University of Southern California몭s graduating class of 2014, sporting a poofy doctoral tam with a gold tassel dangling from its side.
Iovine was there to deliver USC몭s commencement speech, in which he regaled the graduates with a story about making tea for John Lennon and quoted lines from his 몮favorite poet,몯 R. Kelly. But he also took the opportunity to promote his latest project: an interdisciplinary program called the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. A joint venture between Iovine and his business partner, Andre Young멪better known as the hip-hop super-producer Dr. Dre멪the academy, which matriculated its inaugural 31-member freshman class in August, features a curriculum that weds its three titular disciplines (art, tech and commerce) in a way that befits the current cultural landscape. They want to create a dream factory, Iovine said in his speech, that will 몮inspire, challenge, and satisfy the curiosity of the next wave of game-changers.몯
Iovine and Dre know about changing the game. For two and a half decades, Iovine, 61, was the head of Interscope Records (later Interscope Geffen A&M), where he helped oversee the careers of U2, Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefani and the Black Eyed Peas. Dr. Dre, 49, is a legendary producer with six Grammys and hundreds of millions in sales to his name, who has helped guide proteges such as Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent and Eminem. Together, they launched their company, Beats Electronics, in 2008, building it from a start-up headphone manufacturer with cool celebrity endorsements into a technology brand so lucrative that Apple recently paid $3 billion for it. Now Dre and Iovine are using $70 million to fund their school.
As Iovine explains it, the school is as much an investment in their own future as it is philanthropy. 몮We wanted to build a school that we feel is what the entertainment industry needs right now,몯 he says. 몮There몭s a new kid in town, and he몭s brought up on an iPad from one and a half years old. But the problem with some of the companies up north [in Silicon Valley] is that they really are culturally inept. I몭ve been shocked at the different species in Northern and Southern California멪we don몭t even speak the same language. The kid who몭s going to have an advantage in the entertainment industry today is the kid who speaks both languages: technology and liberal arts. That몭s what this school is about.
몮The problem with the school system is that a lot of it몭s cookie-cutter,몯 he adds, 몮so what we몭re trying to do is disrupt it a bit.몯
In other words: They몭ve revolutionized hip-hop. They몭ve revolutionized headphones. Now can they revolutionize college?
ON A BLAZING AFTERNOON at the end of August, Iovine and Dre are at a mansion in Encino, California, watching a fake pool party take place. The mansion doesn몭t belong to either of them; it몭s a location for a movie about Dr. Dre몭s old hip-hop group, N.W.A., which is filming now and scheduled to be released next year. Production assistants scurry from room to room, and scantily clad extras drift by in early-몭90s-era swimwear. Dre몭s wife of 18 years, Nicole, is also on set. 몮This is a big deal,몯 Dr. Dre says with a sly grin. 몮We got Jimmy to the Valley.몯 (Iovine, who몭s not a fan of inconvenience, jokes that he almost founded the academy at UCLA instead, because it몭s closer to his home in Santa Monica. 몮I could walk there!몯 he says, laughing. 몮Every time I몭d drive to USC, I몭d be like, how much is this costing?몯)
Growing up in Compton, California, Andre Young attended Centennial High School but was a so-so student and dropped out in order to pursue music. He spent his college-age years DJ몭ing at clubs, until he and his friend Eazy-E formed N.W.A. (Ice Cube joined soon thereafter.) Although he grew up just 10 miles from the USC campus and was a big Trojans football fan, it was never a real possibility for Dre to go there. 몮I would have loved to go to that school,몯 Dre says wistfully. 몮But I didn몭t have that opportunity.몯
Iovine was raised similarly far from academia, the son of a longshoreman in Red Hook, Brooklyn. He spent a year and a half at Manhattan몭s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, but it was 몮a complete bust.몯 몮School was not my thing,몯 Iovine says. 몮I put down the wrong thing on the application멪I checked off five city schools, and that was the one they sent me to. There were 48 people in the class, and 46 were cops. The only thing I knew about criminology was Batman.몯 At 19 he got a job sweeping the floors at a Manhattan recording studio, and from there worked his way into a gig as a recording engineer for John Lennon. Within a few years, he was engineering albums for Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty.
Dre and Iovine met in 1992, after Dre had put the finishing touches on his first solo album, The Chronic. Iovine had co-founded Interscope two years earlier, and he was looking for some talent. 몮I wasn몭t a fan of hip-hop,몯 Iovine recalls. 몮They were playing me hip-hop because Interscope was going to be in the hip-hop business, but it all sounded muddy to me. I몭m a recording engineer멪it just offended me sonically. Then Dre brought in his record, and it sounded as cool as Pink Floyd or Sgt. Pepper몭s. I said, 몬Who mixed this?몭 and he said, 몬Me.몭 And I said, 몬No, no, but who engineered it?몭 And he said, 몬Me!몭 And I said, 몬OK, I몭m getting into business with you.몭 몯
Dre went on to form his own subsidiary of Interscope, Aftermath, which launched the careers of 50 Cent and Eminem. He and Iovine say the qualities that made them mesh well as record executives also helped them succeed with Beats: 몮We just trust each other,몯 Iovine says. 몮He몭s as good a producer and engineer as Michael Jordan is a basketball player. He has an incredible patience that I don몭t. And he몭s a good touchstone for me. Every time we start going off one way, he몭ll say, 몬Nah, man멪we몭re getting corny.몭 몯
Beats started with a chance run-in on the beach. Iovine was in Malibu, at his friend David Geffen몭s house, when he decided to go for a stroll. He happened upon Dr. Dre, who was out on the balcony of his own house nearby. Dre told him he몭d been approached a few days earlier by an athletic company about doing a shoe line; his lawyer wanted him to do it, but Dre wasn몭t sure. (몮I몭m not into fashion,몯 he says. 몮I wear the same s멪 every day.몯) He asked Iovine for his thoughts. Iovine몭s immortal response: 몮F멪 sneakers멪let몭s make speakers.몯
몮It몭s a good thing they didn몭t want to sell aluminum,몯 Iovine jokes now. 몮I몭m not sure what rhymes with that.몯
Beats headphones have been criticized by audiophiles who insist they몭re far from the best headphones on the market. Yet helped by Dre몭s musical cachet, Iovine몭s marketing savvy and a raft of celebrity endorsements (Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, LeBron James), the company earned $1.2 billion last year alone. It can make a pair of headphones for $40 that sells for over $200; one Swarovski-studded model retails for more than $1,000. And Marc Jacobs incorporated Beats headphones into his runway show this fall.
Earlier this year Beats expanded its mission, unveiling a music-streaming service, Beats Music, designed to compete with the Pandoras and Spotifys of the world. It몭s not immediately obvious that headphones would lead to streaming; after all, it몭s not like Nike ever broadcast a basketball game. But Iovine has been an advocate of streaming for years. 몮Streaming was actually first,몯 he says. 몮I couldn몭t get it done. I didn몭t have the platform. But once I had Beats, I had the platform. It몭s a piece of equipment, a piece of hardware. And I wanted to build a piece of software that worked with it.몯
When Apple announced it was acquiring Beats, it was the culmination of a long flirtation between the two companies. Thirteen years ago, Iovine was one of the first people Steve Jobs showed iTunes to, when Jobs was trying to get the music industry on board with the idea. And Iovine had been shopping a subscription music service to Apple, including to Jobs personally, within a couple of years of the launch of iTunes. (Jobs, long a skeptic of subscription services, passed.) 몮Every deal I made, I offered to Apple,몯 Iovine says. 몮I only wanted to work with Apple.몯
Since the acquisition, analysts have focused on three possible explanations for why Apple wanted Beats. One is that it몭s buying the hardware: As Apple expands into more wearable products (e.g., its new smartwatch), Beats gives it a valuable foothold, especially in the youth market. Second is that it몭s buying its software: the proprietary algorithms and expert-curated playlists that it hopes will position Beats ahead of its streaming rivals. The third theory is the most intriguing: What Apple is really buying are Iovine and Dre. Since Jobs died, the thinking goes, Apple has lacked the kind of magnetic personality who can serve as the company몭s face멪someone with creative vision, deep industry ties and the ability to close a deal. In musical terms, it needs a frontman. As Jobs몭s biographer Walter Isaacson recently speculated to Billboard, Iovine, especially, might be that face.
For his part, Iovine shrugs this off. 몮I몭m just the ornament on the hood멪and I don몭t mean because I몭m sexy.몯
Iovine and Dre won몭t, or perhaps can몭t, share many specifics about their new roles at Apple just yet. But listening to them talk, it몭s clear that what몭s occupying their thoughts right now is the idea of integrating the people who create art with those who distribute it. 몮I think what you몭re seeing more and more are companies that are designed to do multiple things,몯 Iovine says. 몮If you look at the Beats model, there몭s software and hardware. Look at what Amazon is doing; look at what Google몭s trying to do. It몭s technology and content in one.몯 As both an example and a cautionary tale, he cites Sony. 몮They had it,몯 Iovine says. 몮They had the Walkman, they had the PlayStation. And they bought Columbia Pictures and Columbia Records, so they had the content. But they never finished the thought멪and Apple ended up with the products. Where do you think Steve got the idea?몯
At heart, this is what the Iovine and Young Academy is about멪creating the kind of student who can design the next PlayStation and sell it, too. Iovine and Dre aren몭t exactly drawing up lesson plans or keeping office hours. (As Iovine likes to point out, David Geffen doesn몭t teach surgery at his medical school.) But they are scheduled to appear at the academy몭s lecture series, and Iovine recently hosted a barbecue for the incoming freshmen at his house.
몮Dre, how did you find talking to the kids the other day?몯 he asks.
몮I mean, I was the one doing most of the talking,몯 Dre says.
Iovine chuckles. 몮They were terrified!몯

CBS Promises Streaming Service as Earnings Jump; Media Company몭s Revenue Rises 2%, Helped by Higher Licensing and Advertising Fees

CBS Corp. said Wednesday its pay channel Showtime will follow the lead of rival HBO and offer its programming through a streaming service available to people who don몭t have pay television subscriptions.
Speaking to analysts on the company몭s third quarter earnings call, CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said 몮fairly definitively몯 Showtime will have such an 몮over-the-top몯 Web offering in 2015. CBS has already launched such a service for its broadcast network and on Thursday it will debut a streaming news service called CBSN.
Programmers such as CBS and Time Warner Inc.몭s HBO are aggressively looking for new ways to reach viewers that may be eschewing traditional cable and satellite television. CBS also said it had reached an agreement to have its content streamed on a new over-the-top video service being launched by Sony Corp.
In its traditional TV business, CBS몭s growth in the third quarter came primarily from content-licensing and the subscription fees paid by pay TV operators. That was partially offset by a soft advertising market. The entertainment segment멪which includes the television network, CBS Television studios and CBS Films멪reported revenue grew 1.4% to $1.91 billion.
The cable networks unit reported revenue rose 4.7% to $624 million, mostly on revenue from the licensing of Showtime original series, as well as increases in affiliate revenue at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks.
Over all, CBS reported a profit of $1.64 billion, or $3.03 a share, which included a $1.56 billion gain related to its spinoff of the outdoor advertising company CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. A year ago, the company had earnings of $494 million, or 80 cents a share. Excluding restructuring-related charges, write-downs related to a radio station swap and other items, earnings from continuing operations were 74 cents a share.
Revenue increased 2% to $3.37 billion. Content licensing and distribution revenue grew 4.3% to $1.4 billion, thanks to increased international and domestic licensing of television programming.
CBS is anticipating a battle with satellite operator Dish Network Corp. as the companies renegotiate their carriage contract, which expires at the end of this month. Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said Tuesday that the CBS broadcast network몭s new online service 몮makes that product less interesting몯 for pay-TV operators because 몮customers have a choice to get it somewhere else.몯
CBS몭s Mr. Moonves, noting that the network몭s ratings are up this season, sounded confident about the Dish situation. 몮We몭re determined to get paid fair value for our programming. We know how to get this done and rest assured we will,몯 he said.
Mr. Moonves also touted new affiliation deals with LIN Media, Tribune Broadcasting, Media General and Gray Television that have the company on track to take in $2 billion in revenues by 2020 for carriage of its programming.

Why Hollywood Went Gaga for Alibaba During Jack Ma's Big Trip

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The Alibaba money-train pulled into Hollywood last week as studios and talent agencies rolled out the welcome mat for founder-exec chairman Jack Ma and his team of content-hungry executives.
It was a certifiable love-fest, as China's richest man dusted off his cinephile status during a Q&A session at the WSJD Live conference, telling entertainment industry power brokers that "The Bodyguard," "Forrest Gump" and "The Godfather" movies rank among his favorites. More important than insight into his Netflix queue was that Ma made it clear he brought his checkbook with him on the trans-Pacific flight.
"I come here to learn. I come here to look for partners," Ma said.
Despite a slew of meetings and a warchest of $25 billion from Alibaba's recent public offering, it's not clear Ma will be signing many checks just yet.
"They're kicking the tires of the car," says media analyst Hal Vogel. "It's not a question of do they have the money. They're still in the discovery phase of 'What should we do and how should we do it?' "
Movie chiefs and agents were only too happy to lay out the possible ways Ma could go on a spending spree.
The Alibaba chief took a meeting with Paramount CEO Brad Grey and vice-chairman Rob Moore. A sitdown between Ma, Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton and Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chair Amy Pascal resulted in preliminary discussions about a co-financing pact. Ma's team met with Universal's top brass, Fox Studio chief Jim Gianopulos, Lionsgate executives and Relativity Media's leadership. Zhang Qiang, CEO of Alibaba Pictures, was often Ma's ambassador after the technology baron traveled to the Silicon Valley area to meet with his U.S. staff later in the week.
Left off Ma's dance card, at least this time, was Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara, although the studio chief expects to meet with him at some point. Ma's team stressed to the executives it met with that not only was Alibaba eager to distribute their films and television programs, but that the company understands the importance of copyright protections. Piracy is a huge issue in China, so these assurances must have resonated.
The American executives who met the Internet entrepreneur came away impressed. One studio chief who met Ma described him as "unassuming, smart, confident -- and someone who loves movies."
Studios weren't the only ones making a pitch to Ma. CAA's leaders talked with Alibaba, while WME's Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell sat down to discuss ways their roster of A-list clients could work with the Chinese e-commerce giant. Emanuel and Whitesell then took the relationship public by hosting Ma courtside at the Lakers' season-opener at Staples Center.
"That was an obvious signal to the marketplace that 'I'm an insider, not just a technology company,' " says one media and entertainment investor. "It's about making and building relationships."
What Alibaba wants is content for its set-top boxes, and as the box office success of "Iron Man 3" and "Transformers: Age of Extinction" demonstrates, China has a great appetite for Hollywood movies. Alibaba already has signed licensing deals with Lionsgate, and Ma and his lieutenant are eager to lock up distribution pacts for movies and shows, and to hammer out licensing pacts for his company's streaming service.
"We have a vast distribution network of approximately 300 million users, with 100 million people coming to our sites every day," says Robert Christie, a spokesman for Alibaba. "Providing an outstanding customer experience is one of our primary objectives for 2015, and providing quality content is one way to achieve that goal."
Hollywood has had a delicate relationship with China for years, but there are indications that things are improving. In the past, many executives traveled to the country, with high hopes that they could break into its market of 1.4 billion people and access its rivers of cash, only to end those expeditions empty-handed. However, several recent flirtations have been consummated -- Jeff Robinov's Studio 8, for instance, secured backing from China's Fosun Group; and Robert Simonds' new studio is being partly supported by Hony Capital. In the case of Alibaba, its public status and burgeoning network of customers and services shows a clear opportunity.
"One of the holy grails for the movie business has been, 'How do you get into China, '" says Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. "It's a difficult market to (crack), but finding a partner like (Alibaba) might be an ideal way to go about it."
The recent whirlwind tour was seen as mostly a fact-finding mission for Ma, and insiders expect that any deals that come out of it will be co-productions or joint ventures. That said, should Alibaba want to lay down roots, it has the financial heft to buy a studio.
Ma speaks English fluently and understands the cultural currency that Hollywood boasts. His biggest obstacle to attaining a fruitful relationship may be his own country: China's strict censors could wreak havoc on any deep investment in the entertainment business he might want to make here.
"Doors are wide open to him anywhere in Hollywood, because he's got a bankroll. But he's got a dilemma," Vogel says. "He's got the right idea about what his customers and viewers want, and he has an understanding of American culture. But he doesn't have a free hand, because of the Chinese government."
Some things money can't buy.

Warner Music Group Signs Deal to License Music to SoundCloud; Warner Is First Major Record Label to Start Earning Money From German Audio-Sharing Site

Warner Music Group has signed a deal to license its music to SoundCloud Ltd., the companies said, making Warner the first major record label to start earning money from the German audio-sharing website.
SoundCloud will pay royalties to both Warner Music and its publishing division, Warner/Chappell Music, each time one of the songs they몭ve opted to monetize is streamed on its free, ad-supported service, as well as for songs played on a new subscription service, according to a person familiar with the matter.
SoundCloud plans to launch the subscription service in the first half of next year, said SoundCloud Chief Executive Alexander Ljung. The record company몭s decision to sign the deal had hinged upon the guaranteed launch of the paid subscription service, which will likely offer consumers different levels of access for different monthly prices. SoundCloud will continue to offer a free listening option as well, Mr. Ljung said.
Currently SoundCloud is free for listeners, about 175 million of whom visit the site each month. Internet radio company Pandora Media Inc., by comparison, has nearly 80 million active monthly users, while on-demand music service Spotify AB has 40 million, about 10 million of whom pay for $10-a-month subscriptions.
Musicians and DJs who want to upload songs, mixes and mashups onto SoundCloud in significant volume pay a monthly fee. As of now, record companies don몭t earn money from the site, nor do artists, music publishers or songwriters. Any such copyright holders can request to have their content removed from the site if users put it up without their permission.
Record labels have allowed much of their content to remain on the site, however, on the theory that the exposure might help drive sales or listening on other services that do pay. Most commonly, labels remove music that has been leaked prematurely, or at the request of a particular artist.
SoundCloud started advertising on the site this summer to bring in revenue that could pave the way for licensing deals. It is already sharing revenue with about 40 partners, from independent labels to individual artists, but Warner Music is the first major label to sign on.
The deal doesn몭t require Warner Music, the smallest of the three global music companies, to license its entire catalog to SoundCloud. That is because SoundCloud users visit the site mostly to discover underground artists or hear fresh remixes of popular tunes, so the service doesn몭t feel compelled to maintain the kind of 25-million-song library offered by unlimited-subscription streaming companies such as Spotify and Apple Inc.몭s Beats Music.
Warner, whose roster includes the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bruno Mars and Led Zeppelin, will also earn royalties when bits of its songs are spliced into mashups, not just when its songs are streamed in their entirety. Warner is owned by billionaire Len Blavatnik몭s Access Industries Inc.
As part of the deal, Warner will also take a stake in SoundCloud, according to people familiar with the matter, in line with the 3% to 5% slice that record labels had discussed taking earlier this summer.
Spotify gave major labels equity several years ago as part of a deal to get that service licensed in the U.S.
Warner Music Chief Operating Officer Rob Wiesenthal said it was difficult to say how much revenue SoundCloud could ultimately generate for the label, but added that the site has a particularly 몮passionate following몯 compared with other digital music services.
Warner Music몭s rivals have taken a cautious approach to dealing with SoundCloud. Interviewed at The Wall Street Journal몭s WSJD Live technology conference, Lucian Grainge, chairman of Vivendi SA몭s Universal Music Group, said last week there is an 몮opportunity for SoundCloud to create incredible revenue.몯 But, he added, he would first need to hear 몮what the business plan is going to be.몯 He added that he doesn몭t believe advertising alone generates sufficient revenue to adequately compensate music companies or their artists. He indicated that subscription services that charge users recurring fees are more acceptable. Neither Universal Music nor Sony Corp.몭s Sony Music Entertainment have moved any closer to licensing deals with SoundCloud in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.

Discovery International Business Again Drives Growth; Media Company Trims Revenue Forecast After Quarterly Results Miss Expectations

Strong international growth drove Discovery Communications Inc.몭s profits 10% higher in the third quarter, even as weak TV ratings and ad sales at its domestic channels contributed to a decision to cut revenue guidance for the year.
The cable channel owner, whose properties include Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, has been aggressively expanding overseas in recent years. Its international operations recently became a bigger revenue driver than its U.S. business.
That trend continued in the most recent quarter. The company reported a 14% rise in revenue to $1.57 billion, as a 32% rise in international networks offset a 1% decline in domestic networks. In terms of profitability, the international networks showed a 25% rise in operating income before depreciation and amortization, while domestic networks were flat on that measure.
The company primarily blamed the domestic revenue decline on a difficult comparison with last year, when digital licensing revenue was robust. It also acknowledged that ratings were a problem at its networks. Among the three biggest channels that account for about 70% of the company몭s revenue, ratings are down for the season at TLC and Animal Planet, and have only recently begun to rebound after a tough summer at the flagship Discovery Channel.
The company몭s stock fell 6.6% in Tuesday Nasdaq trading to $33.31.
몮Improving our ratings is a top priority here in the U.S.,몯 Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav said, noting that the company had recently hired former longtime Disney executive Rich Ross as president of the Discovery Channel.
The company is also facing a soft market for last-minute advertising sales, known as the 몮scatter몯 market, particularly in the last month, Mr. Zaslav said. 몮There몭s no question that in the last month, things have slowed,몯 he said of advertising sales. 몮Our sense is it몭s a little more cautiousness about how to deploy capital.몯
In part for this reason, as well as negative foreign-currency effects and the impact of a coming ban on pay-TV advertising in Russia, the company lowered its revenue outlook for the year, saying it now expects to post revenue of $6.3 billion to $6.35 billion, compared with its previous estimate of $6.45 billion to $6.525 billion.
In July, Russia passed a law banning ads on pay-TV channels, effective Jan. 1. Discovery Communications, which has been in Russia for a long time with channels such as Discovery, Science and Animal Planet, says the rule change forced it to cut its revenue outlook by about $20 million. Executives emphasized that Russia brings in less than 2% of the company몭s global revenue.
Mr. Zaslav said that a further tightening of Russian pay-TV rules expected at the end of 2016, which would force a reduction of non-Russian-owned media to under 20%, 몮probably will happen,몯 though the company will be 몮optimistic if we can get a workaround.몯
Back home, Discovery said it signed a deal with Sony Corp. to be part of the online video-streaming service it plans to launch by year몭s end, becoming the second major media company after Viacom Inc. to do so. A Sony spokesman confirmed the deal, saying that it would share more details including which channels and how many channels at a later date.
Meanwhile, Mr. Zaslav continued to raise concerns about Comcast몭s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable, and that one distributor controlling so much of the buying power for cable networks could cause 몮a retraction of investment in content.몯
Overall, profit for the quarter rose to $280 million, or 41 cents a share, from $255 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.

Babs, Aretha, Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett Ride Timeless Tunes to the Top

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - From Barbra Streisand's "Partners" and Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga's "Cheek to Cheek" -- both of which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 -- to collections from Annie Lennox, Barry Manilow, Aretha Franklin, Bryan Adams, She & Him, Billy Childs and Bette Midler, the fourth quarter has brought a gold mine of cover albums featuring timeless copyrights presented in fresh ways.
That is a very good news for music publishers, for whom copyrights are the gift that keeps on giving. This holiday season's bounty is the most abundant anyone can remember in recent years -- the combination of well-known artists performing beloved songs provides perfect stocking-stuffer material.
While many of the compilations focus on tunes from the Great American Songbook -- the canon of standards written from the 1920s to the 1950s -- others, such as Franklin's salute to divas, Adams' "Tracks of My Years," and Childs' homage to Laura Nyro, highlight proven hits from the '60s, '70s and '80s, and even up to Adele's 2010 chartbuster, "Rolling in the Deep."
"It doesn't have to be 50 years old to feel like something classic," says Danny Strick, U.S. co-president of Sony/ATV. "When you hear Aretha singing 'Rolling in the Deep," it doesn't sound like a cover, it sounds like an Aretha classic."
Any time an older song is re-recorded, it has the potential to find a new audience and that is a proposition that always interests publishers.
"New versions are always compounding the value of the copyright," says Evan Lamberg, Universal Music Publishing Group's president, North America. "I couldn't tell you because (someone new) cut it the song is going to make another $10 million this year, but it just keeps it out in the atmosphere and keeps it fresh .... These albums build bridges that keep these songs timeless. That's the goal of any publisher."
Most of these artists attarct older demographics, but acts like Lady Gaga or She & Him's Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward can expose the song not only to new ears, but also to a new generation. "Lady Gaga is introducing these songs to a whole new audience," says Kathy Spanberger, peermusic's president and COO. "Some younger people may have never heard these songs."
For many of these projects, the artists already have specific songs in mind and it's a sweet surprise when the publishers realize their songs have been used -- the act only needs the copyright holder's permission if altering the song, such as changing lyrics or mashing it up with another tune.
But in some cases, the publisher can lobby a project. "The Cole Porter Trust was very eager to have Cole Porter's songs on the Tony Bennett/Lady Gaga album," says Sean Patrick Flahaven, Warner/Chappell Music's senior VP of theater and catalog development. "So we worked very hard on that. It was very gratifying to the estate, not only financially, but to bring that music out again." There are two Porter songs on "Cheek to Cheek."
Publishers push the catalog year round: they routinely send out compilations to mark a writer's birthday or death anniversary to remind A&R execs, music supervisors, video game manufacturers, ad agencies and other potential licensors of the copyrights available.
Other times, a television series designs its own reworking of a classic: Jamey Johnson, Shooter Jennings and Marilyn Manson guitarist Twiggy Ramirez totally upended peermusic's copyright "You Are My Sunshine" for a "Sons of Anarchy" episode last year. The haunting remake provoked enough interest that it was released as single. Another one of peermusic's recent successes was viral and radio hit "Cups." Originally featured in "Pitch Perfect," the song was based on A.P. Carter's "Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone."
Warner Chappell takes a proactive stance by asking its singer-songwriters when they are recording their albums if they would also record a catalog song for potential synch usage so the publisher has the song cleared and at the ready.
It's not uncommon, says Flahaven, to tell artists about an upcoming project and ask if they'd be willing to cut a Rodgers & Hart tune. "Then if it's placed, it makes up for the time and expense of recording it," says the Warner/Chappell exec. "We like to accumulate those in our pitching system in general."
While these cover projects undoubtedly help fill publishing companies' coffers, diminished sales -- no album released in 2014 has reached platinum -- and issues with streaming payments do not make them the treasure trove they once were. "It's the reality of the environment we are in," Spanberger says.
"Streaming money to publishers and writers is anemic (from) Pandora and Spotify. It's just hundredths of a cent compared to a performance on the radio or a mechanical. But there is an upside to having these songs exposed on the Internet."
There's a reason these classics remain relevant for any audience, says Jay Landers, executive producer of Streisand's "Partners": "The greatest songs from the golden era all the way up to the standards of today have a common thread, which is that they are truly crafted. They are songs with a beginning and middle and end and take the listener on a journey."
Landers questions whether many of today's rhythmic-dominated pop songs will turn into tomorrow's evergreens, but he is very sure of one thing: "I have no doubt that 'Over the Rainbow' will be sung forever."

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - With Christian Bale parting ways on the project, Sony has moved quickly to find the man to portray the late Apple founder Steve Jobs.               
Michael Fassbender is in early talks to play "Jobs" in the the Sony biopic that Danny Boyle is directing, sources confirm.               
Based on Walter Isaacson's biography "Steve Jobs," the real-life drama is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin.               
Seth Rogen is in talks to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Scott Rudin will produce along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.               
Sorkin has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple's famous product launches.               
"The first one being the Mac," he told the Daily Beast. "The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod."               
"It's a little like writing about the Beatles," he added. "There are so many people out there that know him and revere him."               
Leonardo DiCaprio had been circling the role but eventually passed to take time off from acting. David Fincher had also been in talks at one point to direct.               
Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul's death in 2011.

Activision몭s Revenue Jumps 78% on 몬Destiny,몭 Mobile Sales; Videogame Maker몭s Holiday Outlook, However, Falls Below Analyst Expectations

Activision Blizzard Inc. reported a better-than-expected revenue increase of 78% in the third quarter, boosted by the new sci-fi shooter game 몮Destiny몯 and continued growth in its mobile business.
Shares of the videogame maker, up more than 18% over the past 12 months, rose 3.6% in after-hours trading, despite issuing a fourth-quarter forecast that fell short of expectations.
The Santa Monica, Calif., company guided for earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $2.2 billion in the December quarter, compared with the Wall Street consensus of 94 cents a share on $2.34 billion in net revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.
New versions of popular titles 몮Skylanders,몯 몮Call of Duty몯 and 몮World of Warcraft몯 are expected this quarter. Ahead of the release, Activision reported a quarterly increase in 몮World of Warcraft몯 subscribers.
Also seen helping holiday results is continued sales of 몮Destiny,몯 which was released in September and represents the latest project by Bungie, the developer behind the popular 몮Halo몯 series.
Game developers like Activision have benefited from the latest generation of videogame consoles, Sony Corp.몭s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Corp.몭s Xbox One, both released last year. In the latest period, Activision reported next-gen consoles accounted for $468 million, or 40% of net revenue.
Activision, which like its peers once relied on sales of videogames stored on discs, has been shifting to digital downloads and customizing game offerings to specific markets. For example, Chief Executive Bobby Kotick said the company has a special version of 몮Call of Duty Online몯 for China.
For the most recently completed period, digital downloads accounted for 67% of total revenue, up from 59% a year earlier.
Overall, Activision reported a loss of $23 million, or three cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $56 million, or five cents a share. Excluding changes in deferred revenue and other items, Activision몭s per-share earnings rose to 23 cents from eight cents a year earlier.
Gaming companies spread out revenue for games with online components over the life of the subscription instead of at the time of sale.
Net revenue, adjusting for such deferred revenue and other nonrecurring items, was $1.17 billion. Mobile-related revenue rose 27% to $505 million.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a profit of 13 cents a share on $1.01 billion revenue.

Apple, Google Set Disney Video Deal; Tech Giants Will Allow Movie Buyers to Watch on Devices Running Rival몭s OS

Walt Disney Co. has achieved something that many in Hollywood멪and Silicon Valley멪have been attempting for years: Getting Apple Inc. and Google Inc. to play nicely together.
In an unprecedented agreement to share rights to digital content, the two tech giants will allow consumers who buy a Disney movie from either of their online stores to watch it on smartphones, tablets and other digital devices that run their rival몭s operating system.
Starting Tuesday people who register with the Disney Movies Anywhere app and buy a copy of 몮Frozen몯 from the Google Play store on an Android tablet, for instance, can later watch the film on an Apple TV through their iTunes library.
Until now, Apple has restricted movies, TV shows and other content to its own family of iOS devices, along with Mac or Windows computers. Google placed similar restriction on its digital store and Android-powered devices.
Such a strategy can help to lock consumers into one hardware company, but Hollywood studios have long argued that it makes people wary of buying digital movies because they must worry that if they buy a different device, their film library will disappear. DVDs, by contrast, work on players built by any manufacturer.
Both Apple and Google will pay Disney a wholesale rate for each copy of a film that they sell and keep any profits, regardless of the devices on which people watch.
몮This is about getting people comfortable with building their digital movies collection,몯 said Jamie Voris, chief technology officer at Walt Disney Studios. 몮Disney is going to protect them and make sure they can watch their movies wherever they want to.몯
The deal is particularly notable because every major Hollywood studio save for Disney is part of a coalition called Ultraviolet that, like Disney Movies Anywhere, is designed to let people build a library of movies online without worrying about restrictions on the devices they can use to watch.
Ultraviolet launched in late 2011, more than two years before Disney Movies Anywhere. Yet the backers of Ultraviolet, which include Time Warner Inc.몭s Warner Bros. and Sony Corp.몭s Sony Pictures Entertainment, have been unable to persuade Apple to join Ultraviolet. Though its market share has been falling, Apple still controls 61% of online movie sales, according to research firm IHS.
Google, which is also not part of Ultraviolet, accounted for 7% of U.S. online movie sales in the first half of 2014.
몮The approach Ultraviolet has taken relative to the approach Disney Movies Anywhere has taken is slightly different,몯 said Jonathan Zepp, head of Google Play Movies partnerships. 몮[Disney몭s] was the one we felt was the right path for us to move forward with right now.몯
Asked whether other movies from studios were likely to become available for similar sharing between Google and Apple devices, Mr. Zepp called such a proposition 몮philosophically interesting.몯
The agreement applies to Disney movies purchased online and digital copies that come with Blu-ray discs.
A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.
Disney and Apple have had close corporate ties since the media giant몭s 2006 acquisition of Pixar Animation Studios, which at the time was controlled by Apple몭s then-chief, Steve Jobs. Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger is on Apple몭s board and a trust controlled by Mr. Jobs몭 widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, is the largest shareholder of Disney, with a 7.5% stake.
Mark Teitell, general manager of Ultraviolet, noted that apps from companies that are part of his coalition, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.몭s Vudu, are usable on Apple and Android devices.
몮We tend to look at what a consumer can do with six major studios몭 titles,몯 Mr Teitell said.
With Apple and Google, Disney Movies Anywhere now works with retailers that account for more than two-thirds of digital movie sales. Ultraviolet works with stores that account for less than 12%.
Amazon.com Inc., which made up almost 9% of digital movie sales in the first half of this year, is in talks with several studios to join Ultraviolet, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.
Though it releases fewer movies than other major studios, Disney is a powerhouse in the home video market because its family-entertainment titles are more frequently purchased so that young children can watch them repeatedly.
Disney Movies Anywhere launched in February, but worked only with Apple몭s iTunes at the time. A version of the app for Android devices launches Tuesday. Despite the expanded usage rights under the Disney deal, the economics of digital movie sales will remain the same, a knowledgeable person said.

Tokyo stocks rose 2.7% to a seven-year high Tuesday, bringing gains to 7.7% since the Bank of Japan몭s surprise decision Friday to expand easing measures, with a stronger dollar powering buying.
After breaking into positive territory Friday, the Nikkei Stock Average is up 3.5% for the year and trading at its highest level since October 2007. The market was closed Monday for a national holiday.
The dollar was at ?113.66 late in Asia, well up from ?109.22 Thursday, before the Bank of Japan몭s move.
Japanese exporters were among the big gainers on the Nikkei. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. was up 9.6%, Sony Corp. rose 9.0% and Panasonic Corp. was up 4.0%.
In Korea, the Kospi fell 1.0% to 1935.19 as Korean exporters such as auto and electronics goods makers declined on worries that rivals in Japan will have a pricing edge in global markets. The index is down 3.8% this year and is the worst performing among major indexes in the region.
Hyundai Motor Co. lost 3.5% and Kia Motors was down 0.6%, after the companies agreed to pay a combined fine of $100 million and forfeit regulatory credits valued at $200 million to settle charges they overstated the fuel economy of vehicles sold in the U.S.
Markets elsewhere in the region were mixed.
The Shanghai Composite Index was flat at 2430.68 and Hong Kong몭s Hang Seng Index was down 0.3% at 23845.66. HSBC was down 0.5% in Hong Kong after it released weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter late Monday. The bank is the biggest component stock on the Hang Seng Index.
Japan몭s central bank took markets by surprise Friday as it increased its buying of government bonds to ?80 trillion (around $700 billion) annually from ?60 trillion-?70 trillion. The $1.1 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund also said Friday it would boost its domestic stock allocation to 25% from 12%.
몮Another 15% appreciation in stocks from Friday몭s close to the end of 2014 isn몭t out of the question,몯 said CLSA equity strategist Nicholas Smith.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Music rally can shake off discordant Taylor Swift

By Jeffrey Goldfarb
NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Back in 1989, the year Taylor Swift was born and the title of her latest hit album, Garth Brooks sold over 10 million copies of his eponymous record. It is a bygone era for the music industry. Until Swift released the collection that includes "Shake It Off" last week, no artist had sold even 1 million this year. That sort of popularity gives her the market power to make decisions like the one she did on Monday to pull her catalog from digital streaming service Spotify.
The Swedish company was eager to get back together with her. It said on its blog that about four out of every 10 users had played Swift's songs in the last 30 days and that she was on 19 million playlists. In truth, though, a music rebound can happen even if the mega-star never comes around to the subscription idea.
The economics of the $15 billion industry have changed too dramatically. Global recorded music revenue tumbled by another 3.9 percent last year, dragged down by an unexpected collapse in Japan. Meanwhile, sales from services like Spotify increased by over 50 percent and surpassed the $1 billion mark - from zero not so long ago. In the first half of this year, paid streaming revenue surged in the United States, Japan and big European markets like Germany and France. Credit Suisse analysts reckon total sales will actually grow in 2016.
Artists may earn less than a penny per play, but Spotify argues that it's better for all of them if consumers are paying rather than stealing. And for the companies behind the music - especially the three giants, Vivendi's Universal, Sony and Warner Music - the profit margins are better than for CDs and probably even downloading. A customer who shells out $120 a year for an annual Spotify subscription exceeds the $50 or so an average digital downloader spends, according to industry trade group BPI.
Consumers also are getting used to the idea of having access to a big slug of the world's music library. Apple's acquisition of the Beats music service could accelerate the appeal, given its 800 million iTunes accounts. There's no mistaking that a music industry slowly bouncing back will depend on superstars like Taylor Swift, but it's also never going back to 1989.
              
              
              
              
CONTEXT NEWS
              
- Spotify said on its blog site on Nov. 3 that it hopes Taylor Swift will "change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone," following media reports that the pop star had pulled her music from the digital streaming service. Spotify said nearly 16 million of its users had played her songs in the last 30 days and that she was on 19 million playlists.

A Hamster몭s Take on His Bratty Owner; Simon Rich on Ripping Off Heroes, Bombing a 몬30 Rock몭 Audition and His Inability to Learn From Success

몮Spoiled Brats,몯 a new collection of short stories by Simon Rich, begins with a tale narrated by a class hamster about the casual sadism of a school kid named Simon Rich. In another story, a hard-working immigrant emerges from a pickle vat after spending a century preserved in brine, only to encounter his self-indulged great-great grandson, also named Simon Rich.
The 30-year-old comedy writer doesn몭t just take aim at himself in this book, his sixth, but at mothers who think their little monsters are gifted and fathers who몭d rather die than get overtaken by their sons. (Literally멪that mother몭s child has horns, and that father asks his son to club him to death after losing at Scrabble.)
Mr. Rich found success early, nabbing a two-book deal before graduating from Harvard. Just out of college, he became one of the youngest writers in the history of 몮Saturday Night Live,몯 where he worked from 2007 to 2011.
He has been spending this fall in Toronto shooting 몮Man Seeking Woman,몯 starring Jay Baruchel, set to premiere on FXX next year. Mr. Rich is a writer on the cable series, which is based on his 2013 short-story collection, 몮The Last Girlfriend on Earth.몯 And he just finished the first draft of the screenplay based on the story of the pickled immigrant at the center of 몮Spoiled Brats몯; Sony Pictures acquired the movie rights to the piece, 몮Sell Out,몯 after it appeared in the New Yorker.
Mr. Rich, whose father is former New York Times writer Frank Rich, lives in Brooklyn with his wife and fellow writer, Kathleen Hale. He spoke with the Journal about ripping off his heroes, his inability to learn from success, and the time he bombed an audition for a character based on himself. An edited transcript follows.
You몭ve chosen some unusual narrators in your writing.
In my last book, I wanted to write a story about all the fear and anxiety that goes into losing one몭s virginity, and so I wrote it from the perspective of a condom in a teenage boy몭s wallet as he waited and waited to get used. That몭s always been my favorite way to tell a story, to start with a subject that몭s universal and hopefully emotionally relatable, and come at it from a brand new angle.
How did it occur to you to write a story from a hamster몭s point of view?
That몭s a very self-loathing, autobiographical story. It몭s about my own experiences being a spoiled, obnoxious 8-year-old boy, and I thought the funniest angle and the highest-stakes angle to tell that story from would be from the perspective of a creature I was actively hurting.
Have you given much thought to where your humor comes from?
The clich? is that all comedy writers were picked on and miserable and had miserable childhoods and are compensating for some kind of childhood trauma, but I don몭t think that몭s always true.
I know a lot of extremely funny writers who have incredibly boring upbringings. I also know a lot of people who have had horrible childhoods who are some of the most miserable, unfunny people you몭ve ever met.
For me, I think it just comes from loving jokes. The reason I got into this career is just because I wanted to rip off my heroes. I grew up obsessing over 몮The Simpsons몯 and reading Mad magazine and reading Philip Roth and P.G. Wodehouse and Evelyn Waugh and Joe Heller and reading Matt Groening comic books and just thinking, man, wouldn몭t it be great to just live in this world all the time?
How did you handle it at 몮SNL몯 when a piece you몭d written bombed?
I found personally that as a writer멪and this is true of story writing and novel writing and screenplay writing and sketch writing멪it몭s almost impossible for me to reverse-engineer any of my successes. I can몭t sit down and say, 몮Oh, this short story really worked, I몭m going to write one like that.몯 I몭m not really ever able to learn from my successes, but I몭ve always been able to learn from my failures.
So when you were writing for that show, you could figure out what went wrong right away?
Oh yeah, because sometimes the audience will go, 몮Oooh.몯 Or they몭ll sigh or they몭ll chuckle instead of laugh, or physically you look over and see them get confused or lose focus. You can tell. I often wish when I write a book that I could watch people몭s eyes as they몭re scrolling through the page.
What몭s it like to watch a stranger read one of your New Yorker stories on the subway?
I stare at them the whole time. If they make it through the end of the article, then I몭ll feel like I몭ve succeeded, and if they flip to another page, I몭m devastated.
Have you ever wanted to act in one of your comedies?
I always tell the story, to explain how bad of an actor I am, which is when I was writing for 몮SNL,몯 some friends of mine who wrote for 몮30 Rock몯 based a character on me. They called me downstairs to audition, and I did such a bad job I wasn몭t even called back for the role.
What was the role?
It was Tina Fey몭s agent, who I think was named Simon in the draft.
Did you perform in any 몮SNL몯 sketches?
As a sight gag. You can usually find me in some embarrassing, dehumanizing role. I was a white Harlem Globetrotter. I was an emaciated Incredible Hulk. More of a prop than an actor.

Christian Bale Drops Out of Steve Jobs Biopic

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - After early discussions to play the Apple founder, Christian Bale has decided to part ways with the Steve Jobs biopic at Sony.               
While negotiations were never fully under way, sources tell Variety that Bale had talks with director Danny Boyle about taking on the role, but a deal never came to fruition. The news comes almost two weeks after the biopic's screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, told Bloomberg that Bale was a lock for the part of Jobs. ""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that's Chris Bale," he said. "It's an extremely difficult part and he's gonna crush it."               
Sony will now look to find its replacement after Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio both passed on the part. The studio is in discussions with Seth Rogen to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.               
Scott Rudin, Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady are producing.

몬Nightcrawler몭 Neck-and-Neck With 몬Ouija몭 at Box Office

In a scary close finish, the Jake Gyllenhaal crime thriller 몮Nightcrawler몯 and the board-game adaptation 몮Ouija몯 tied for first at the box office with $10.9 million each over the Halloween weekend.
That was according to estimates Sunday from each film's distributor. Studios can predict a film몭s Sunday performance with fairly accurate precision. When final figures are announced on Monday, one film will likely slightly edge out the other.
For Open Road몭s low-budget Los Angeles noir 몮Nightcrawler,몯 it was a strong debut considering its creepy, unconventional protagonist. Mr. Gyllenhaal plays an ambulance-chasing man who shoots gory footage for the local news.
The independent, R-rated film was able to capitalize on a weekend that frightened away many studios. With Halloween falling on a Friday, trick-or-treating cannibalized one of the most lucrative moviegoing nights of the week. Grosses were down 40% on Friday from the same weekend a year ago, according to box-office tracker Rentrak.
Open Road몭s estimate for 몮Nightcrawler몯 was technically $8,760 above Universal몭s number for 몮Ouija.몯 But that tiny margin may not hold up when receipts from Sunday are counted. Other studios had 몮Ouija몯 as narrowly edging 몮Nightcrawler.몯
몮We몭ve seen squeakers over the years but this is one of the closest ones I몭ve ever seen,몯 said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Rentrak. 몮It몭s a testament to the holding power of 몬Ouija.몭몯
Despite the Halloween night impact, 몮Ouija몯 dropped only 45% after topping the box office last weekend. That몭s unusually low for a micro-budget horror film, most of which see interest wane considerably after opening. But Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures opened the horror film a weekend ahead of Halloween to give it a two-week window.
The close contest added drama to one of the quietest movie weekends of the year. Overall business was down 25% from the prior year. Said Mr. Dergarabedian: 몮The scariest thing about this weekend was that Halloween fell on a Friday.몯
Next weekend will be a far different story, though, with the highly anticipated release of Christopher Nolan몭s science-fiction epic 몮Interstellar,몯 as well as Walt Disney Co.몭s animated superhero film 몮Big Hero 6.몯
In the meantime, the World War II tale 몮Fury몯 from Sony Corp.몭s Columbia Pictures held in third place with $9.1 million in its third week of release. In its fifth week, the Twentieth Century Fox thriller 몮Gone Girl몯 also remained in fourth with an additional $8.8 million to its $136.6 million cumulative total to make it the highest-grossing release of director David Fincher몭s career.
Twentieth Century Fox parent 21st Century Fox was until last year part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - "Nightcrawler," a dark crime thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a cameraman in the high-speed world of siren-chasing journalism, topped sluggish weekend domestic box office charts with $10.9 million in ticket sales.
"Ouija," last weekend's box office leader, was second by a razor-thin margin, selling just $8,760 fewer in tickets in a weekend slowed by candy-gathering Halloween trick-or-treaters and revelers, according to estimates from tracking firm Rentrak.
The World War Two war film "Fury" was third with $9.1 million for the three days from Friday through Sunday in the United States and Canada.

 Sony  Posts Hefty Loss, but With Glimmers of Hope;  Sony  Reports $1.2 Billion Loss After Smartphone Business Write-Down; PlayStation 4 Sells Well

TOKYO멪Sony Corp. investors have suffered through years of losses, but the latest massive one, reported Friday, contained a bit of good news for the Japanese electronics and entertainment giant.
Booming sales of its PlayStation 4 videogame console and of camera sensors for smartphones offset weakness in the company몭s own mobile division, resulting in a less-than-expected net loss of ?136 billion ($1.22 billion) for the summer quarter.
Without a previously announced ?176 billion write-down of the value of its mobile business, Sony would have posted a profit, the company said. As a result, even some Sony executives were broaching the possibility that the company might have finally hit bottom.
몮Excluding one-time effects, we have gradually started to make profits,몯 said Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony몭s chief financial officer, at a news conference in Tokyo.
Sales in the videogame business surged 83%, and the division recorded an operating profit of ?21.8 billion, reversing a year-earlier loss. The PlayStation 4, released less than a year ago, sold at a record pace in August. Sony몭s devices unit, which supplies Apple Inc. and other smartphone makers with image sensors, posted an operating profit of ?29.6 billion, more than double the year-earlier level. Ahead of the holiday-shopping season, both units raised their full-year revenue forecasts.
Even Sony몭s television unit, which has been losing money for much of the last decade, logged an operating profit멪marking its first back-to-back quarters in the black since fiscal 2003. Sony has said it expects the unit to be profitable for the full financial year ending in March. Sony몭s overall sales rose 7%, to ?1.9 trillion yen, in the quarter.
To be sure, no one is celebrating yet. Over the last decade, Sony has repeatedly offered hints of a possible turnaround, only to dash hopes with a renewed slump. The latest worry is the weakness of the Japanese currency, which plunged against the dollar Friday after the Bank of Japan surprised the markets with monetary-easing measures. Mr. Yoshida said every decline of one yen against the dollar costs Sony ?3 billion in losses.
Sony also needs to fix the smartphone business, which the company only a year ago said was a pillar of its turnaround strategy. Since then the business has been hit by severe competition from inexpensive Chinese handset markets. The segment showed an operating loss of ?172 billion in the July-September quarter, largely due to the charge to write down the business.
On Thursday, Sony named a new head of its mobile division, Hiroki Totoki, who is seen as a close ally of Mr. Yoshida. The chief financial officer has stepped up restructuring and cost-cutting efforts since being named to that post earlier this year.
Mr. Yoshida said Friday that Sony would scale back its smartphone business in China, the world몭s biggest mobile market, by giving up on sales of low-end handsets that compete with domestic makers. Mr. Yoshida said the board was considering shrinking in other emerging countries, but declined to specify.
The decision to reduce its handset offerings in China led Sony to revise downward its sales target for Xperia smartphones for the full year ending in March, to 41 million units from 43 million. That was the second cut to Sony몭s smartphone forecast this year; initially the company predicted sales of 50 million smartphones, up from 39.1 million in the previous fiscal year. Most analysts said at the time that the projection was unrealistic.
몮We had debated whether it would be right to shrink our presence in the world몭s largest smartphone market, but have judged what we need to do right now is to rebuild the business structure,몯 Mr. Yoshida said.
Analysts say the fortunes of Sony몭s smartphones now depend on the U.S. market. They are hopeful that Mr. Totoki, who was a start-up member of Sony몭s banking unit, would be able to build stronger relationships with U.S. mobile carriers, which have sometimes been reluctant to carry Sony smartphones, and to make the business more efficient.
몮With his experience of setting up and running a bank, I몭m confident Mr. Totoki can establish a relationship of trust with carriers,몯 said Atsushi Osanai, a former Sony product strategist who now teaches at Tokyo-based Waseda Business School.
Mr. Totoki said he is proud of the company몭s smartphones and wants to turn the mobile division into a star performer once again. But some Sony watchers are wary, saying more radical measures than the 15% personnel reduction that Sony has announced for the division may be necessary.
몮We could be told it will cost more and take longer for Sony to finish the mobile unit restructuring,몯 said Yasuo Nakane, an analyst for Deutsche Securities.

Emma Watson, Judi Dench, Robert Downey Jr. Honored at Britannia Awards

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - British royalty mingled with Hollywood royalty at the Britannia Awards on Thursday night at the Beverly Hilton.
Taped messages from J.K. Rowling and Prince William were sent to the guests while Judi Dench, who has played Queen Elizabeth on the big and small screen was among the honorees.
Rowling sent her wishes to Emma Watson, the night's first honoree. "I'm so glad she wanted to act (after 'Harry Potter') because it means we didn't spoil it for her."
Watson, who grew up on the "Harry Potter" film franchise described how her pet died during filming of the third movie. "The set decorators made a tiny coffin for my hamster," she said. "The British film industry is not just an industry but also a family where I grew up."
By the time honorees Judi Dench, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. were introduced the presenters got a little more raw in their speeches. Dustin Hoffman called Dench "the sexiest broad with the lustiest laugh."
Dench regaled audiences with stories about how a top producer told her she would never make it in film "because my face was not arranged properly." While the Albert Cubby Broccoli honoree had never met the filmmaker, she said she "owed Cubby Broccoli for all the Bond films. I had a sensational time making the films."
Downey was introduced by Jamie Foxx and Jon Favreau. Foxx said when he first met Downey the honoree said he wanted a house. "I thought he should at least have a career," Foxx said, adding, "When he started to play black people, I started to get nervous."
"Sometimes I just can't get enough of myself," Downey said in his acceptance speech. "It's ugly."
Then Downey had his wife, Susan, stand up so the guests could she how pregnant she was. Describing this second pregnancy as rather difficult on him, he said he was on bed rest.
Armando Iannucci presented Louis-Dreyfus's award and deadpanned, "Comedy is many things but we can all agree it's not drama. That's why there's only one comedy actor honored here among so many actors."
Louis-Dreyfus was remarkable, he said, because "she's got five Emmys, which is equal to one BAFTA. Not only is she funny, shockingly for a woman, but thanks to her efforts we have four comediennes now."
Louis-Dreyfus said knowing she was a winner already was a big help. "There's no anxiety, I don't have to put on your 'I'm so happy Lena Dunham won' face." Pretending to stumble through her acceptance speech till Iannucci gave her a sheet, she breezed through it in a non-regional English accent.
Humanitarian honoree Ruffalo, who was presented his award for his work with Water Defense by Josh Gad, said, "Wow, I was convinced I wasn't going to get this tonight," before turning serious about the need for clean water. "Our entire existence is wrapped up in water, we need it."
Director Mike Leigh was introduced by fellow helmer Jim Sheridan. "I hate Mike Leigh, everytime I make a depressing movie, he makes a really depressing movie and wins awards," Sheridan joked.
Leigh said he wasn't going to thank anyone but then gave a shout-out to Sony Pictures Classics co-toppers Michael Barker and Tom Bernard. "I made 19 films without scripts," he said.
The evening was hosted by Rob Brydon, introducing himself as Renee Zellweger, and got huge laughs talking about the Scottish vote for independence. "Trust a Scotsman never to pull out when he says he will."

TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp  reported a second-quarter operating loss on Friday that was narrower than analysts had estimated, as blockbuster sales of its PlayStation 4 games console reduced the impact of a sluggish smartphone division.               
Operating loss reached 85.6 billion yen ($771 million) in July-September, compared with the 164.3 billion yen average estimate of 3 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. In the same quarter last year, Sony booked a profit of 14.8 billion yen.               
The company posted a net loss of 136 billion yen for the quarter and held its full-year net loss forecast at 230 billion yen.               
Sony also lowered its smartphone sales outlook to 41 million handsets from 43 million, compared with 39 million last year.

Seth Rogen to Play Apple Co-Founder Wozniak in Steve Jobs Biopic

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Seth Rogen has been set to star as Steve Wozniak opposite Christian Bale in Sony's Steve Jobs biopic, sources confirm.
Variety reported on Oct. 15 that Bale was in talks to star in "Jobs," Sony's biopic about the late Apple co-founder. Writer Aaron Sorkin recently confirmed the Bale casting.
Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role.
Based on Walter Isaacson's biography "Steve Jobs," the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle.
Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.
Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama "The Social Network," has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple's famous product launches.
Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul's death in 2011.
Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987.
Last year's independently financed "Jobs" starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched. Worldwide box office was modest at $36 million.
Rogen starred this year in Universal's "Neighbors" and will be seen next with James Franco in Sony's "The Interview."
He is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.

By Soham Chatterjee
Oct 30 (Reuters) - GoPro Inc forecast better-than-expected holiday quarter sales, underscoring the increasing popularity of its wearable cameras among surfers, skydivers and other action junkies.
GoPro's shares, which went public in June, shot up 14 percent in extended trading on Thursday after the company also reported strong third-quarter results.
Videos taken using GoPro cameras, which can be mounted on helmets, boards, bikes and dog harnesses, have made a big splash on the Internet.
YouTube videos such as "Run Walter, RUN!!", "Waltz On The Walls of City Hall" and "Golf Trick Shot" have gone viral, helping GoPro's cameras gain popularity beyond sports and outdoor enthusiasts.
"The social media side of the business had great metrics, with YouTube content up 92 percent year-over-year (in the third quarter) and YouTube views up 99 percent," Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Reuters.
"All this indicates growing brand awareness, and bodes well for a successful holiday," Pachter said.
The California-based company launched the latest version of its flagship Hero4 camera and a cheap entry-level camera in September, targeting holiday shoppers.
"We anticipate particular strength in our direct channel both with our big box and midmarket customers," Chief Financial Officer Jack Lazar said on a conference call.
The company said it expects a profit of 65-69 cents per share on sales of $550-$580 million for the fourth quarter ending December.
Analysts were expecting a profit of 55 cents per share on revenue of $505.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
GoPro dominates the action camera market, with analysts estimating a market share of more than 90 percent.
The resounding success of its cameras has prompted several companies such as Sony Corp, Garmin Ltd and Panasonic Corp to launch their own offerings.
According to NPD Group's Retail Tracking Service, GoPro was the top-selling camcorder in the United States in 2013.
FIRST-QUARTER BEAT
GoPro reported an adjusted profit of 12 cents per share for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, topping the average analyst estimate of 8 cents.
Revenue rose about 46 percent to $280 million. Analysts on average had expected $265.6 million.
The net income attributable to GoPro shareholders was $14.6 million, or 10 cents per share, in the third quarter compared with a loss of $1.1 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier.
The company's shares were trading at $73.33 after the bell. The stock has more than doubled since its market debut in June. (Reporting by Soham Chatterjee in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)

TAIPEI멪Taiwan몭s economy logged its best quarter in almost two years, as higher income from electronic exports and tourist arrivals filtered through to the rest of the economy.
In the three months ended Sept. 30, Taiwan몭s gross domestic product rose 3.78% from the same period a year earlier and was up 0.49% from the previous quarter, an initial reading by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics showed Friday. This was the highest pace of expansion, since the economy recorded GDP growth of 3.85% in the fourth quarter of 2012.
On a year-over-year basis, growth was largely in line with the government몭s previous estimate of 3.62% and the median 3.85% increase forecast by 10 economists in a survey by The Wall Street Journal. The economy expanded 3.74% in the previous quarter.
Taiwanese manufacturers are supplying key components such as microprocessors and camera lenses to global electronics brands such as Apple Inc. and Sony Corp. Near-record overseas sales of semiconductors for iPhones, continued but modest recovery in key overseas markets, particularly the U.S., and strong growth in income from tourism boosted Taiwan몭s overall exports by 6.68% in the third quarter from a year earlier. That was faster than a 2.88% growth in the second quarter.
Economists say strong demand for new iPhones and the global rollout of faster fourth-generation mobile networks will continue to buoy demand for Taiwanese-made electronic components in the fourth quarter.
According to the Tourism Bureau, 7.25 million people visited Taiwan during the first nine months of this year, up 25% from a year earlier. China was the largest source of tourists, with 2.96 million people visiting, up 36% from a year earlier.
Barclays Research predicts Taiwan몭s GDP will grow 4.10% this year, better than the government몭s target of 3.41%, citing rising income from tourism. But it will still be way below the plus-5% expansion it regularly reported before the global financial crisis.
Capital formation, which includes government and private-sector investment in fixed assets and changes in inventories, gained 7.89% in the third quarter, after rising 6.9% in the second quarter.
An improving job market also lifted private consumption by 2.43% in the third quarter, although it was slower than a 2.53% rise in the second quarter. The government said the gain was partly offset by a drop in sales at restaurants since an adulterated cooking-oil scandal broke in early September.

Samsung, LG turn to quantum dots as OLED still too pricey

SEOUL, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The world's biggest TV makers, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and LG Electronics Inc , are turning to quantum dot technology for their next-generation TVs as it could still be years before OLED is affordable for the mass market.
The nascent technology involves incorporating a film of tiny light-emitting crystals into regular liquid crystal displays (LCD). The manufacturing process is relatively straightforward and offers improved picture quality at much cheaper cost than using organic light-emitting diodes (OLED).
The resulting lower prices could help the technology catch on far quicker. One industry analyst estimated a 55-inch quantum dot TV could be priced 30 to 35 percent more than a current LCD TV, while an OLED TV could be 5 times more expensive. LG recently launched a 65-inch ultra-high definition OLED TV for 12 million won ($11,350) in its home market of South Korea.
The only real challenge is securing enough quantum dot material from the small pool of suppliers, including Quantum Materials Corp and Nanoco Group PLC.
Nanoco last month said a South Korean plant being built by partner Dow Chemical Co will start quantum dot production in the first half of 2015. Analysts believe the output is destined for a local client.
On Wednesday, LG, the world's No.2 TV maker after domestic rival Samsung, said it plans to make quantum dot TVs in addition to OLED TVs. Analysts regarded that a tacit acknowledgement that OLED needs more time for prices to come down before becoming the new standard.
"We are pursuing a dual-track strategy with quantum dot and OLED," LG Chief Financial Officer Jung Do-hyun told analysts after the company reported earnings. OLED is the fundamentally superior product, he said.
Samsung Vice President Simon Sung told analysts on Thursday that quantum dot is among many technologies under consideration.
"How a technology will match with market conditions, when a technology will emerge as the main market segment is the most critical consideration," Sung said. "We'll respond aggressively after identifying such a market opportunity."
At present, Japan's Sony Corp is the only major electronics manufacturer selling quantum dot TVs. Last month, China's TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings Ltd unveiled a quantum dot TV at the IFA tech expo in Berlin.
OLED RISK
LG and affiliate LG Display Co Ltd are the biggest champions of OLED TVs, in contrast to Samsung which has not released a model this year. Analysts say the lack of Samsung support could limit OLED growth prospects and keep prices high.
"In theory, OLED should become cheaper than LCD once production yields get better because OLED doesn't need a backlight, but at this point both the scale and production yield remain low," said CIMB analyst Lee Do-hoon.
"LG needs a product in the interim, and they seem to be saying they'll look at market conditions and respond with quantum dot," Lee said.
Samsung could be more aggressive than LG in pushing quantum dot as Korea's No.1 consumer electronics maker appears less committed to a particular technology, analysts said. LG, on the other hand, risks undermining its OLED push.
"If LG focuses on quantum dot, it'd be basically the same as signalling that it will be difficult for OLED to go mainstream in the near term," said CIMB's Lee.
Researcher DisplaySearch forecasts 1.95 million quantum dot TV shipments next year, for just 0.8 percent of the market, growing to 25.5 million by 2020. IHS Technology sees OLED TV shipments at 7.8 million units by 2019 from 600,000 in 2015.
Some analysts question how successful quantum dot TVs will be given the availability of affordable LCD TVs, including ultra-high definition sets that they say offer enough bang for the buck.
"The main lineup for TVs is still LCD TV, so I don't know how much quantum dot matters," said HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh. "I don't think it would signify anything more than bolstering the product lineup."

(The Day Ahead is an email and PDF publication that includes the day's major stories and events, analyses and other features. To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) Oil companies and Dow components Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are due to report their third-quarter results, which are expected to reflect a drop in the price of crude oil. Investors will look for updates on Exxon's projects in Russia, where sanctions have stalled some operations, and learn if the timetables for new projects aimed at growing oil and gas output are intact. Wall Street analysts are expected to grill Chevron executives on the status of delayed growth projects. U.S. consumer spending likely closed the third quarter on a soft note, setting up for a somewhat weaker fourth quarter. Economists expect the Commerce Department to report that consumer spending rose just 0.1 percent in September (0830/1230).
 Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (0945/1345) and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment data are also scheduled for release (0955/1355). Drugmaker AbbVie Inc, which earlier this month abandoned its $55 billion tax-inversion deal to buy Dublin drugmaker Shire, is expected to report sharply higher third-quarter sales as growth of its Humira arthritis drug offset the impact of falling sales of many of its other products. The company's dependence on Humira will underscore its need to pursue other deals in order to replenish its pipeline of experimental drugs. Third-quarter results from Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, the world's biggest beer maker, may seem a little flat after a boost from the soccer World Cup in the second quarter. However, sales declines are likely in Brazil, its second-largest market. Japan's Sony Corp reports results for the July-September quarter. After announcing a massive writedown on its mobile unit in September, the company is expected to cut the sales forecast for its Xperia smartphones. The company is also expected to report the progress on a restructuring program, under which it will cut 1,000 jobs by March 2015. Timber conglomerate Weyerhaeuser Co, which manages 20 million acres of forests, is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit. The company, in its second-quarter earnings release in August, said third-quarter results will include a net gain of about $1 billion on the divestiture of its home building and real estate company WRECO. However, Weyerhaeuser is expected to report lower third-quarter revenue, hurt by lower realizations from lumber and oriented strand board. Cleaning products maker Clorox Inc will report its first-quarter results before the bell. The company said last month that its chief executive of eight years, Donald Knauss, was stepping down, and days later announced it was exiting Venezuela as the business was "no longer viable." Clorox has missed the Street's profit estimates in the past four quarters. Oshkosh Corp, a manufacturer of specialty trucks and construction equipment, is expected to report a higher fourth-quarter profit as increased sales to builders offsets the impact of a continued decline in sales to military customers. Statistics Canada releases gross domestic product data for August. Analysts expect the real gross domestic product to be unchanged from July (0830/1230). Mexico's central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate and argue that a recent spike in inflation will fade next year. Fifteen analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the bank to leave its main interest rate unchanged at 3 percent while one analyst expected a 25-basis-point cut after weak growth in the third quarter. Separately, Brazil's central bank releases its monthly report on the federal budget. The primary balance is a gauge closely watched by investors because it measures a country's ability to service its debt (0830/1230).

TOKYO--Sony Corp. on Thursday named Senior Vice President Hiroki Totoki as the new head of its mobile division, the electronics giant몭s latest move to prop up its struggling smartphone business.
Mr. Totoki, who once led Sony Bank, part of the company몭s financial arm, as well as the Sony몭s Internet-service provider business So-net, will replace the current head of Sony Mobile Communications, Kunimasa Suzuki, on Nov. 16. Mr. Suzuki will become an executive vice president of Sony Entertainment, which oversees the conglomerate몭s music, movie and publication segments.
몮In light of the global mobile market that is rapidly becoming competitive and difficult, we need to make our business profitable,몯 a spokeswoman at Sony said. 몮Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai judged Mr. Totoki, who has a proven track of record in turning the business profitable, is the most suited for the job.몯
Sony posted a net profit in the April-June quarter despite the unprofitable smartphone business, thanks to its financial and videogame segments.
The 50-year-old Sony veteran has been widely viewed as the man behind the curtain in implementing Sony몭s structural reforms aimed at returning the company to profit in the next fiscal year, which begins in April.
Sony in September lowered its earnings forecast for the year ending in March as it plans to write down the book value of the mobile segment, a move that was welcomed by some analysts as proof that Mr. Totoki and Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida were taking a greater control of the company.
Sony몭s July-September quarterly earnings are due to be released on Friday. The company is expected to record a big net loss because of the announced ?180 billion ($1.65 billion) mobile division write-down. It is also plans to lower its sales goals for its Xperia smartphones for the current year. Sony already cut the figure once, in July.

TOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Sony Corp said on Thursday it would appoint senior vice president Hiroki Totoki as the new president of Sony Mobile Communications on Nov. 16, replacing Kunimasa Suzuki at the top of its troubled smartphone business.
Totoki is currently serving as corporate planning director after Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai pulled him back from a subsidiary to headquarters as one of his closest confidantes along with Kenichiro Yoshida, chief financial officer.
Slow sales of Sony's Xperia smartphones have weighed on the company's flagship electronics division, prompting it to cut its sales forecast once this year and sparking media reports that it will do so again when it announces results on Friday.

How the Kinks Roughed Up Their Sound; To come up with the fuzzy distortion on 몬You Really Got Me,몭 members of the Kinks distressed their speakers with knitting needles and razor blades. A look at how the influential 1964 hit took shape

Before garage rock and heavy metal, there were the Kinks. In 1964, the London band몭s use of power chords and fuzzy distortion on 몮You Really Got Me몯 influenced the Rolling Stones (몮Satisfaction몯), the Beatles (몮Think for Yourself몯), the Yardbirds (몮Heart Full of Soul몯) and other groups in 1965 and beyond.
When 몮You Really Got Me몯 was released in August 몭64, the single went to No. 1 in Britain and No. 7 in the U.S., and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Fifty years later멪with the release of 몮The Essential Kinks몯 (Sony)멪Ray Davies, 70, the song몭s composer and band몭s lead singer; his brother and lead guitarist Dave Davies, 67, (whose CD 몮Rippin몭 Up Time몯 is due out on Tuesday); and the single몭s producer Shel Talmy, 77, talked about the hit몭s inspiration and development. Edited from interviews:
Ray Davies: Just after I formed the Ravens in 1963 with my brother Dave and bassist Pete Quaife, we began wearing colorful outfits bought in boutiques on London몭s Carnaby Street. Months later at a pub with our manager, Larry Page, I insisted we needed an edgier name than the Ravens. A drunk who had been watching us said we looked like kinks to him멪short for kinky or weird. Larry picked up on that and said, 몮The Kinks! That몭s perfect!몯
Before the Ravens, while I was still at college, I played in the Dave Hunt Blues Band, a gritty R&B-jazz crossover group. Around this time I wrote 몮You Really Got Me몯 on my guitar at my sister몭s house in North London. My influences were country and blues멪something that [blues guitarist] Big Bill Broonzy would play.
The inspiration for the lyrics and title came to me one night while playing with Dave Hunt at The Scene Club in Soho. During our set, I looked out in the darkness about 10 feet from the stage and saw what appeared to be a 17-year-old girl moving better than anyone else on the dance floor. She had ash-colored hair set in a beehive style popular then. When we finished, I went off to find her, but she was gone and never returned to the club. She really got me going.
When I played the song first for Pete, our bassist, he said he didn몭t care for it. It didn몭t sound commercial enough for him멪not pop enough. He thought it was almost too basic to be a teen song. Then I played it for the rest of the band in the front room of my family몭s house in London. Everyone liked it. I wanted it to sound coarse, the way we came across through club speakers that couldn몭t handle the volume. Then I set the song aside.
In 1964, after we changed our name to the Kinks, we were under a lot of pressure to come up with a hit for our label, Pye Records. Our first two singles멪몮Long Tall Sally몯 and 몮You Still Want Me몯멪hadn몭t charted. So I pulled out 몮You Really Got Me몯 and went to work on it. I played the riff on the piano at my parents몭 house. Dave learned the song and played the chords on his guitar. I wanted the song to sound like a Gregorian chant멪with its repetitive theme멪over a blues. I also wanted to dirty up the guitar sound.
I also wanted a distorted bass sound with echo effect, the way Ray Charles몭s electric piano sounded on 몮What I몭d Say몯 coming through the bad speaker of my parents몭 record player. To try to emulate that sound, I punched a few holes in Pete몭s preamp speaker with my mother몭s knitting needle.
Dave Davies: I always liked how our band sounded at clubs멪coarse and sort of stripped down. Months earlier I had passed a radio shop a few doors up from my parents몭 house on Denmark Terrace. In the window I saw a small teal space-age Elpico amp for 10 quid. I bought it, but when I got home, I was alone and had a moment of teenage inspiration or rage. I had just learned to shave, so I took one of my razorblades and slashed up the amp몭s speaker cone. I had no idea whether what I had done would work, but when I plugged in the guitar, I was blown away by the raucous sound that came out. It was gritty. Up until then, rock guitars in London had sounded very clean and polished, except for blues players. But the blues sound wasn몭t what I had in my head then. It was just rage.
Ray Davies: Our first recording of 몮You Really Got Me몯 was a demo we made at Regent Sounds on London몭s Denmark Street. Shel Talmy, an American independent record producer who was working in London at the time, liked what he heard.
Shel Talmy: When I arrived in London in 1962, I expected to stay only a few weeks. But after I met with A&R chief Dick Rowe at Decca, he hired me to bring in new artists and record them. A year later, I was visiting some friends at a music publisher on Denmark Street when Robert Wace, the manager of some band called the Kinks, came into reception and asked if anyone wanted to hear a demo. I volunteered. After we listened in my friend몭s office, I thought the demo had a number of potential hits. By then, I was ticked at Decca for turning down two bands I had brought in to be signed멪Manfred Mann and Georgie Fame. So after I met the Kinks, we went into Pye in 몭64 to record their first two singles. When those didn몭t chart, we recorded 몮You Really Got Me.몯 Pye executives loved the playback but two days later, Ray said he didn몭t like it and wanted to rerecord the song.
Ray Davies: It was too slow, and the engineers had cleaned up our distortion, adding echo and making it sound perfect, which was exactly what I didn몭t want to happen. I wanted the single to sound live and raw, the way we sounded live at clubs. After some back and forth, the label agreed to let us rerecord provided we paid for it. So I borrowed ?200 from our managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace. A few weeks later, we rerecorded 몮You Really Got Me몯 at London몭s IBC Studios. I thought about adding a specific girl몭s name to the lyric but decided against it. I had sung, 몮Girl, you really got me goin몭 몯 at most of our gigs and stuck with that.
Dave Davies: I was quite an angry kid. I got my aggression out through my music. For the opening chords at IBC, I used bar chords멪holding down three strings and strumming hard and them shifting my fingers to a different place on the neck. I picked that up from listening to the Ventures몭 몮Walk멪Don몭t Run.몯 Their rhythm guitarist, Don Wilson, wasn몭t playing the full chords멪he was just hitting the bottom three notes. I thought that was great멪I could do that and not worry about fifths and sixths and things I didn몭t know yet.
Mr. Talmy: At IBC, I placed Ray in an isolation booth so the instruments wouldn몭t bleed into his vocal. For the drums, instead of using four mics, which was standard then, I used 12 to isolate all of the various percussive sounds. I used three mics for Dave멪one in front of his amp, another on a boom at a distance and one pointed at his guitar strings. Each mic picked up different parts of what he was playing, and I combined them later to get the sound you hear on the single. The mic on Dave몭s strings picked up the tinny sound that, when mixed with the other two, gave his guitar a nice top. The Kinks didn몭t have a drummer yet, so I hired Bobby Graham, the best English session drummer at the time for rock. I played the tambourine.
I also overdubbed background vocals to enhance Dave몭s riff. Dave, Pete, Ray and Rasa,멪Ray몭s wife at the time멪sang the background track at one mic. Then I had everyone switch positions and I double-tracked the vocals so there would be more dimension.
Ray Davies: To me, the sheer power of Dave몭s hands combined with the anger and aggression with which he played the riff of my song counted more than any distorting speaker.
After we recorded at IBC, we went on Britain몭s 몮Ready, Steady Go몯 TV show in July 몬64, just before the single몭s release. Once teens saw us and heard our metallic sound, the excitement built and the single took off after its release the following week. Part of what the audience was responding to was the song몭s key shift from G to A. The more natural and melodic place for the song to go was from G to C or D. But I wanted it to go to A, which was quite revolutionary then. There몭s something about that full step up that feels like acceleration and raises the excitement level. The progression actually made me shudder when I originally came up with it.
It몭s funny, the song began as a way for me to reach out to that girl at The Scene, to let her know how I felt. I never found her or met her later, but I sort of like to imagine that she knows 몮You Really Got Me몯 was written for her and that she몭s out there still, an age-old diamond.

Nintendo Logs Better-Than-Expected Net Profit; Japanese Game Maker Profits on Weaker Yen, Stronger Software Sales

OSAKA멪Nintendo Co. on Wednesday said a weak yen and sales of popular game titles boosted its quarterly performance and the company몭s hopes for a full-year profit멪even as skepticism among industry watchers persists.
The Kyoto-based game maker reported net profit of ?24.22 billion ($224 million) in the three months ended September, well above analysts몭 expectations and a turnaround from an ?8 billion loss a year earlier.
President Satoru Iwata said Nintendo is poised to break a three-year streak of operating losses and is on track for a net profit of ?20 billion for its March-ending fiscal year, after a loss of ?46 billion in the preceding year. 몮What we are seeing right now is good proof that our business still has a lot of growth potential,몯 Mr. Iwata said at an earnings conference.
The surprisingly strong results for its fiscal second quarter give Nintendo some breathing room, as Mr. Iwata tries to persuade investors that the company몭s strategy of sticking to game consoles is sound. Players have been shifting to smartphones, downloading games as free apps rather than buying consoles and packaged games of the sort that Nintendo thrived on during the heyday of its Super Mario Brothers franchise.
Nintendo, which has steadfastly resisted licensing its games for use on smartphones, gave no hint Wednesday that it might rethink its approach.
The company is scheduled to give a separate briefing on strategy Thursday.
For its latest quarter, Nintendo highlighted solid sales of 몮Smash Brothers몯 and other games for its hand-held 3DS game console, which was developed in-house. Although 3DS sales were weaker in the quarter멪1.27 million consoles compared with 2.49 million a year earlier, Mr. Iwata said he is confident the sales would pick up as popular titles, including new Pok?mon games, are released later this year.
The yen몭s weakness has been a boon, inflating the value, in yen terms, of Nintendo몭s sizable pool of assets held in dollars and euros. About 40% of Nintendo몭s revenue comes from North America, while the European region accounts for 30% and the Japanese market 25%.
Still, for Nintendo and its competitors, the current quarter and its year-end shopping season hold the key, and Mr. Iwata said the company is banking on its pending release of strong game titles.
Many analysts ahead of Nintendo몭s earnings announcement said the picture for the game maker remains grim and its earnings target is likely out of reach. Nintendo몭s latest home console, the Wii U, launched in November 2012, has sold 7.29 million units, compared with more than 10 million for Sony Corp.몭s PlayStation 4, which went on sale a year later.
In the recent quarter, Wii U sales more than doubled from a year earlier to 610,000 units. For the full year, Nintendo is aiming for 3.6 million Wii U sales, up from 2.7 million units, while keeping sales of the 3DS roughly flat at 12 million units. 몮We believe our business is in line with our forecast, and the unit target isn몭t impossible to achieve,몯 Mr. Iwata said, stressing that analysts have been too pessimistic.
Many analysts say the company needs to tap into businesses such as smartphone applications and new markets like China to achieve sustainable growth.
몮Console gaming is becoming increasingly niche compared with the mass-market app-based gaming that has exploded through social media and mobile devices like smartphones and tablets,몯 said Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, after the Nintendo announcement.
Mr. Iwata hinted the company is making progress in expanding to China. Earlier in the year, he also alluded to new initiatives such as health care-related business, word of which could come at Thursday몭s strategy briefing.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) The U.S. Commerce Department releases gross domestic product figures. The economy likely advanced at a solid 3.0 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The figure would mark a slowdown from the second quarter's outsized 4.6 percent gain, but a reading of domestic demand likely gained speed with much less of the strength coming from inventories - a sign of growing fundamental strength. While weakness overseas has raised questions over the sustainability of above-trend U.S. growth, many economists think a tightening labor market is providing the fuel needed to keep the recovery on track (0830/1230). The Labor Department releases weekly unemployment claims data (0830/1230).
Mastercard Inc's volume growth has been decelerating due to a key issuer loss. Shares of the world's second-largest payments company are down as much as 12 percent this year on investor concerns about international sanctions on Russia and competition from new forms of mobile-based payments. The company reports third-quarter results and is expected to implement merchant-acquiring fee increases in January that could add to its revenue growth and earnings. Time Warner Cable Inc reports third-quarter results before the bell. Investors will be looking for any comment regarding the decision of HBO and CBS to go over-the-top and anything new on the pending merger with Comcast. Social networking website for professionals LinkedIn Corp reports third-quarter results. LinkedIn is likely to beat the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine data, as it gains market share from job sites such as Monster.com and Careerbuilder. The company is also expected to benefit from its timeline ads and growing user base. Investors would focus on user growth rate and engagement after social media companies such as Twitter reported slowing user engagement. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen gives welcome remarks before the "National Summit on Diversity in the Economics Profession" conference hosted by the Federal Reserve, in Washington (0900/1300). Brazilian miner Vale SA is expected to post a hefty drop in third-quarter earnings as iron ore prices fell to five-year-lows during the quarter. Investors will be keeping an eye out for any news on cuts to investment projections or any projects that might be dropped. Gold miners Newmont Mining Corp and Goldcorp Inc reports third-quarter results. Newmont is expected to report a drop in third-quarter profit and lower revenue. The company resumed copper concentrate shipments from Indonesia in late September, ending a nine-month suspension from its Batu Hijau mine after the government imposed hefty export taxes. Analysts will watch for any changes to Newmont's production forecasts, which the company updated in late September. Goldcorp is expected to report a dip in profit, but higher revenue. Any changes to production forecasts will be a key focus for investors. Some analysts expect the start up of Goldcorp's Cerro Negro mine in Argentina and resumption of production at the Los Filos mine to boost quarterly production. Also of interest are any comments about the El Morro gold and copper project. Mosaic Co reports third-quarter results after recently curtailing phosphate output due to rising costs. Of interest is any update on how long the curtailment will last and thoughts on timing of a potash supply contract between China's Sinofert and Canpotex, a company owned by Mosaic and other North American miners. Starbucks Corp, the world's biggest coffee chain, posts fourth-quarter results before the bell. Investors expect Starbucks to report another quarter of red-hot U.S. cafe sales, but are braced for any inkling of a cooling trend. They will also keep an eye on its performance in China, where sales at KFC and McDonald's have been hard hit by a meat supplier scandal. Western Union Co, the world's largest money-transfer company, is expected to report a dip in third-quarter profit, hurt by higher regulatory costs. The company is facing rising costs as regulators worldwide crack down on money laundering. Western Union, which has ramped up its digital money transfer business, is being investigated by U.S. regulators for misrepresenting the performance of its digital unit. The company has pushed its guidance of $500 million in digital revenue beyond 2015. Western Union has been negatively affected by slowing consumer money transfer growth due to low foreign exchange volatility. Health insurer Cigna Corp, which has traditionally focused on employer-based health plans, is expected to report a decline in third-quarter profit. Asset manager Invesco Ltd is scheduled to report third-quarter results before market opens. Analysts expect the money manager to earn 62 cents per share, up from 55 cents per share a year earlier. Kellogg Co, the world's largest maker of breakfast cereal, cut its full-year adjusted sales and profit forecasts in July as demand for its Corn Flakes and Special K cereals continued to wane in the United States, its biggest market. The company has reported five straight quarters of sales declines in its U.S. cereal business, hurt by the rising popularity of other breakfast items such as yogurt and frozen egg sandwiches. When the company reports third-quarter results, investors will look for details on how it plans to revive its U.S. business and implement its strategy of repositioning its brands to focus on their nutritional value. ConocoPhillips is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings and update investors on its big investment in growing production from U.S. shale fields including the Eagle Ford in south Texas in a time when crude oil prices have fallen more than 20 percent. National Oilwell Varco Inc, the largest U.S. oilfield equipment provider, is expected to post a higher third-quarter profit, buoyed by demand for its land rigs and jack-up rigs, which are used in shallower waters. Investors will look for any outlook on capital spending considering the recent downward spiral of oil prices. Offshore driller ENSCO Plc is expected to report a lower third-quarter profit, hurt by weak demand, which has in turn led to an oversupply of rigs. Investors will be on the lookout for any efforts to reduce costs and comment on drilling activity and customer response, giving the decline in oil prices. Coal miner Alpha Natural Resources Inc, which is struggling with falling prices for steel-making coal and government regulations that are causing electric utilities to close coal-fired power plants, is expected to report a bigger third-quarter loss and third straight drop in quarterly revenue. Investors will be looking for comments on further cuts in coal production, impact of the rail issues, demand for steel-making coal and further cost-cutting initiatives. Auto parts maker Johnson Controls Inc is likely to benefit from higher demand in its power solutions unit as automakers increasingly look to build more fuel-efficient vehicles. When the company reports fourth-quarter results, investors will be looking for comments on its JV with Chinese company Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems, a move that is expected to create the world's largest automotive interiors company. Harman International Industries Inc, which makes car audio systems, is expected to post first-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, according to StarMine data. The company is expected to benefit from higher sales of its car audio systems. Investors will be looking out for updates to the company's full-year outlook. GoPro Inc is likely to post a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, according to StarMine, helped by strong demand for its wearable cameras used to record outdoor activities and sports. The company recently launched an entry-level camera and a new flagship camera - Hero4 - ahead of the holiday shopping season as competition intensifies in the wearable camera market with rivals such as Garmin, Sony, JVC and even HTC launching or revamping their offerings. Online travel agency Expedia Inc, which gets more than half of its revenue from the United States, is expected to post higher third-quarter revenue and profit, driven by higher hotel and flight bookings. Investors will look for an update on how world travel concerns due to Ebola may impact the company in the current quarter. News and information company Thomson Reuters Corp reports third-quarter results. The company said net sales for its financial products were positive in the second quarter and analysts and investors will be keen to hear if that is a trend. Additionally, there likely will be questions around new messaging products out in the marketplace that are trying to displace Bloomberg. The New York Times Co reports third-quarter results. Subscription revenue growth is slowing though the company made big strides in online advertising. Questions remain about where it plans to cut after it announced a reduction in staff earlier this month. Outerwall Inc, the operator of Redbox video rental kiosks, is expected to report third-quarter revenue above estimates, according to StarMine data. The company, which is grappling with lower revenue from the Redbox video rental kiosk business, is expected to benefit from the release of a number of blockbuster movies on DVDs in the second half of the year. Navigation software maker Trimble Navigation Ltd is expected to report a third-quarter profit below analysts' estimates, according to StarMine data. Investors will look for comments on its fourth-quarter forecast. Audio chipmaker Audience Inc is expected to report third-quarter revenue below estimates after its biggest customer, Samsung, warned of increasing competition and weak earnings. Analysts will be looking for fourth-quarter guidance from the company, which supplies chips that improve voice quality in mobile phones. Beauty products company Elizabeth Arden Inc, struggling with weak sales for the past year, is expected to report another disappointing quarter as sales of perfumes, its biggest division, continues to shrink. When the company report first-quarter results, investors will watch out for its progress on restructuring and new product launches this holiday season. Brazil's IGP-M index, which encompasses wholesale, construction costs and consumer prices, is the country's broadest price measure and data for October is scheduled for release. It has declined in recent months as wholesale food prices dropped, suggesting a relief in consumer inflation in coming months. Chile's unemployment figures for July-September are also expected in the day. Jobless numbers have been gradually creeping up as the economic slowdown bites.

* Q2 operating profit 9.3 bln yen; analysts expected loss
* Wii U sales picked up after Mario game launch in May -CEO
* Weak yen a tailwind heading into key year-end sales season (Adds CEO comments on business and own health, weak yen)
By Reiji Murai
OSAKA, Japan Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japanese video game maker Nintendo Co vaulted to an unexpected quarterly operating profit as new game "Mario Kart 8" stoked sales of its Wii U console, bolstering hopes it was on track for its first annual profit in four years.
A weaker yen also boosted the value of its overseas earnings, and the company on Wednesday reported an operating profit of 9.3 billion yen ($86 million) in its fiscal second quarter, compared with an 18 billion yen operating loss a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a 3.7 billion yen loss for July-September, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine.
Ahead of the vital year-end holiday sales season, the results may ease pressure on Chief Executive Satoru Iwata, who is recovering from surgery in June to remove a tumour in his bile duct. As losses mounted in recent years, Iwata, 54 and in the job since 2002, resisted calls for a major overhaul to make famous Nintendo characters like plumber Mario available for games on smartphones, rather than just its own hardware.
As well as facing the challenge of free mobile games played on phones and tablet computers, Nintendo has struggled to keep pace with Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp, now dominant in the home video console market.
Nintendo reiterated its forecast for a full-year operating profit of 40 billion yen, compared with an operating loss of 46.4 billion yen in the previous year. Analysts have been sceptical on this year's target, as well as the company's strategy, with the average estimate prior to Wednesday's announcement being for a 24 billion yen profit.
On Wednesday, the company said sales of its Wii U home games console, the latest version of its now-ageing Wii product, more than doubled in the April-September period from a year earlier, rising to 1.1 million units.
Iwata told reporters that Wii U sales had improved since "Mario Kart 8", the latest game to feature Mario, went on sale in May. With the year-end holiday sales period coming up, he said the company still aims to sell 3.6 million of the consoles in the current business year though March 2015.
"Through April to September we saw sales improve, especially overseas in the U.S. and European markets," Iwata said of the Wii U. "This year is different to last year, when we headed into the year-end without momentum or good software prospects...The goal is fully achievable."
Nintendo said it was also being helped by a cheaper yen, which boosts the value of overseas sales. The yen's downward trend inflated its operating profit by around 2 billion yen over the April-September period, it said.
RETURN TO HEALTH
In his first appearance before reporters since his surgery, Iwata said he now felt well enough to resume regular work duties. The executive was visibly thinner, but said his weight had stabilised over the past two months.
"Of course it was a major illness and surgery, so compared to before, I may shorten the time I'm at work, or perhaps I may cut back on overseas business trips. But in terms of holding meetings, considering strategy, and speaking publicly, I believe I've recovered enough to work as I had before," he said.
As for the business itself, Iwata said Nintendo was heading in a "good direction" ahead of the crucial holiday season.
The company's shares have fallen around 20 percent this year and about 85 percent from their 2007 high, as the heyday Nintendo enjoyed with the Wii console's then-hot status fades into the distance.
Instead of radical strategic change, Nintendo has pinned hopes on hit games such as "Mario Kart 8". The Wii U, the latest version of the console that first hit the market in 2006, was launched in December 2012, but sales had previously fallen short of projections.
The company also maintained its forecast to sell 12 million of its 3DS handheld game players this business year though March 2015.

* Japanese shares up as factory output beats expectations
    * Nomura jumps on rosy earnings data
    * Honda forecasts trimmed on tough competition,
recall-linked problems
    By Thomas Wilson
    TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rose on Wednesday
after better-than-expected industrial production data and upbeat
earnings figures bouyed investor sentiment.
    Industrial production rose by 2.7 percent in September, the
fastest pace since January, easing some concerns about Japan's
factory activity and the broader economy. 
    The Nikkei share average jumped 1.4 percent to
15,543.28 by 0125 GMT, on course for its biggest gain in a week.
    "Anything that's sentiment-positive for the economy is a
double blessing for the market," said Gavin Parry, managing
director of Parry International Trading in Hong Kong.  
    Japan's largest investment banking and securities group
Nomura Holdings was boosted by better-than-expected
earnings. Shares in the firm soared 5 percent after its second
quarter net profit rose 39 percent. [ID: nL4N0SN2ZF]
    Investors bought robot manufacturer Fanuc Corp,
which climbed 1.7 percent, and Sony, which gained 3.1
percent.
    But Honda Motor Co Ltd slipped 0.4 percent in spite
of the promising factory data.  
    On Tuesday the firm trimmed its full-year sales forecasts in
the face of tough competition in Japan and China, as well as the
impact of recalls of cars with air bags made by Takata Corp
. [ID: nL4N0SN34S]
    Shin-Etsu Chemical also disappointed, with shares
dropping 2.5 percent even though the firm raised its earnings
forecasts.
    Companies due to post earnings results after the close of
Wednesday's session include Hitachi Ltd, Mitsubishi
Motors and Nintendo.    
    The broader Topix gained 1.4 percent to 1,269.02.  
The new JPX-Nikkei Index 400 also added 1.4 percent
to 11,546.39.

Outerwall몭s Redbox, Lions Gate Reach New Deal on Movie Rentals

Outerwall Inc.몭s Redbox has signed a new two-year deal with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. that helps to alleviate investor concerns about the DVD kiosk company몭s ability to maintain relations with Hollywood amid major changes to its business.
Lions Gate몭s prior deal with Redbox had expired on Aug. 31 and, as weeks went by with no news, some analysts had begun to question whether there were issues between the two companies.
As with its previous deal, Lions Gate will continue to allow Redbox to rent its DVDs and Blu-ray discs the same day they go on sale. Three other studios delay Redbox rentals until four weeks after their DVDs are available to buy, in a bid to boost more profitable purchases. Redbox pays less for new movies available only on a delayed basis.
The new Lions Gate agreement expires in September 2016 and includes an option to renew.
Sony Corp.몭s Sony Pictures Entertainment and Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures both recently exercised options to renew their deals with Redbox by one year, until September 2015 and December 2015, respectively.
Redbox몭s revenue and operating income declined in the quarter ended June 30 as the once fast-growing company has stalled, with few new locations to install kiosks and increasing competition from digital outlets. A joint venture to rent movies online with Verizon Communications Inc. was recently shut down after performing poorly.
Earlier this year, Outerwall hired a veteran Warner Bros. executive to take over the Redbox business in a bid to transform it and return to growth.
Deals with Time Warner Inc.몭s Warner Bros. and Viacom Inc.몭s Paramount Pictures expire in December, while one with 21st Century Fox Inc.몭s Twentieth Century Fox ends in April.

Real Estate
In Office Market, L.A. Is a Real Drag; Aon Center Was Sold at a Steep Discount

Values for trophy office buildings in large U.S. cities led by New York, San Francisco and Houston have risen sharply in the past few years, due in large part to demand for office space from the technology and energy industries.
Los Angeles, particularly the downtown section of the city, has been a different story.
Consider the recent sale of the Aon Center, the second-tallest tower on the Los Angeles skyline. The 40-year-old, 60-story property sits on the edge of the city몭s financial district on Wilshire Boulevard.
Earlier this month, San Francisco-based Shorenstein Properties LLC. purchased the building from Beacon Capital Partners of Boston for $269 million, about 18% less than what Beacon Capital paid for the building seven years ago.
Beacon Capital wouldn몭t discuss why the building lost value, but Arty Maharajh, who tracks the Los Angeles office market for commercial broker Cassidy Turley, says years of rising vacancy rates are a primary cause.
The building is currently about 40% vacant.
When Beacon purchased Aon Center in 2007, 몮it was well leased up and today it is almost half empty,몯 said Mr. Maharajh, a vice president of research. And pointing to forecasts for downtown Los Angeles office space that show little hope of improved future demand, he adds, 몮The risk level downtown is DefCon 5.몯
To be sure, the office market is doing well in some Los Angeles communities. Technology tenants such as Google Inc.몭s YouTube, gossip website TMZ and Sony Corp.몭s PlayStation have rushed to the Playa Vista neighborhood near the airport, rapidly filling up new developments at fast-rising rents. Low-slung Santa Monica has some of the highest rents in the city, well above downtown, and attracts private-equity firms and other cash-rich tenants.
But downtown Los Angeles, filled with dozens of buildings built in the 1970s to 1980s modeled after New York skyscrapers, generally hasn몭t been attractive to technology companies, which prefer the flexibility to build from the ground up or rehab old industrial buildings.
Meanwhile, the traditional industries located downtown멪finance, legal and accounting firms멪continue to scale back and few analysts expect that to change soon.
Paul Habibi, a professor of finance and real estate at UCLA몭s Anderson Graduate School of Management, estimates that 100,000 square feet of office space has been absorbed downtown this year.
몮That몭s a drop in the bucket.멞It몭s not enough to move the needle and that몭s in light of the fact that zero new square feet of office space has been delivered downtown,몯 he said.
So why, considering such a grim prognosis, did Shorenstein buy the Aon Center? Shorenstein and several other office landlords and foreign investors that are buying downtown properties are betting that the area is at the start of a transformation. Other recent buyers include Brookfield Property Partners, Overseas Union Ltd. and Commonwealth Partners.
Russell Cooper, who heads acquisitions for Shorenstein in the Western U.S., concedes that the city몭s downtown office market has been weak. But his firm is betting that demand for downtown office space will increase in the future as the area becomes a more attractive place to live, which eventually will encourage employers to relocate there, too.
In September, condo prices were 14% higher than a year earlier, exceeding by two percentage points the rate of growth in San Francisco, according to real-estate research and marketing firm the Mark Co., which notes that 3,700 new rental units are under construction.
Mr. Cooper said downtown몭s growing residential population, its burgeoning night-life scene and the city몭s rapidly expanding subway and light-rail lines are creating more interest from employers such as architecture and engineering firms, including tenants currently on L.A.몭s Westside.
몮Tenants are looking to move downtown because it몭s a good place멞for employees,몯 he said. 몮And while the building is older, it lends itself to smaller users.몯
Cassidy Turley몭s Mr. Maharajh isn몭t convinced. He believes the downtown office market won몭t improve soon and that many buyers of skyscrapers, which include foreign investors who believe they have found bargains, will be disappointed.
In any event, Shorenstein isn몭t solely focused on one high-rise office tower. Reflecting the company몭s increasing shift into the more tech- and creative-focused markets, Shorenstein purchased a mostly vacant former manufacturing building in the city몭s downtown Arts District in March, and it is part owner of a former postal distribution center in Playa Vista, a popular new hub for tech companies on the Westside.

U.S. regulators to vote on treating Internet TV like cable

WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission in coming weeks will vote on whether Internet TV should have the same access to television programming as cable and satellite TV providers, which could shake up competition in the video industry.
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler on Tuesday said he has asked his fellow commissioners to vote on a proposal that would help Internet TV services, such as ones being developed by Dish Network Corp, Sony Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, to compete with traditional pay-TV for digital rights to major network programming.
The potential regulatory change concerns online subscription video services that offer scheduled programming similar to traditional pay-TV providers, and not online video services such as Netflix Inc that stream content on demand.
Satellite provider DirecTV is another company that has indicated plans for an Internet video service and CBS Corp this month revealed a plan for an Internet streaming service that would include scheduled programming.
Time Warner Inc's HBO will also launch a standalone online streaming product but its details are unclear.
Traditionally, the FCC has ensured that cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp could negotiate for rights to retransmit network programming. Online video services have not had the same regulatory backing because they rely on a different technology and do not have their own video distribution facilities.
Now, the FCC will vote on leveling the playing field with a technology-neutral definition of a "multichannel video program distributor," with the goal of encouraging new competition in the video market.
"Twenty-first century consumers shouldn't be shackled to rules that only recognize 20th-century technology," Wheeler said in a blog post on Tuesday.
"Consumers have long complained about how their cable service forces them to buy channels they never watch. The move of video onto the Internet can do something about that frustration, but first Internet video services need access to the programs."
A draft of the proposal tentatively concludes that online TV services should have the same access to cable and local TV programs as traditional pay-TV services and seeks comments on whether the obligations imposed on the two types of video services should also be the same.
If adopted, some analysts see the proposal as potentially also creating a new opening for Aereo, a video streaming company whose business model was questioned by a Supreme Court ruling in June that said the company had infringed broadcasters' copyrights by capturing live and recorded programs through antennas and transmitting them to subscribers.
The vote by four FCC commissioners, two Democrats and two Republicans, would formally propose the idea and begin the process of seeking public comments. (Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Tom Brown)

UPDATE 1-Smartphone launches boost Gorilla glass maker Corning

(Adds executive comments, details, estimates, shares)
By Abhirup Roy
Oct 28 (Reuters) - Corning Inc, the supplier of Gorilla glass to Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics , reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings, helped by launches of new smartphone models.
Shares of the company, which also supplies LCD panels to consumer electronics companies such as Sony Corp, LG and Lenovo Group, rose 1.6 percent in early trading.
Smartphones such as Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and Samsung's Galaxy Alpha were launched in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Corning said it would launch a new version of Gorilla glass on Nov. 20.
The company, however, said fourth-quarter core sales in its speciality materials business, which makes Gorilla glass, were expected to decline by low- to mid-teen digits percent from the third quarter due to the absence of any major new launches.
"What happens after a new launch is at some point, they take enough glass to continue to build out their products and that's why we think that in the fourth quarter, we'll see sales down," Senior Vice President Tony Tripeny told Reuters.
Its LCD panel volumes in the current quarter are expected to be flat or fall slightly from the previous quarter as most of the holiday season orders had been shipped in the third quarter, Tripeny said.
Corning had been hurt by falling LCD glass prices in the past few quarters, but the company said the pace of the price decline was moderating.
The company's core net sales rose to $2.65 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.1 billion, a year earlier.
Net income rose to $1.01 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $408 million, or 28 cents per share.
The company reported core earnings of 40 cents per share.
Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of 37 cents per share and revenue of $2.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Corning shares were up 1 percent at $19.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by Kirti Pandey)

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has recruited a well-known veteran of Dell Inc. to lead one of the chip maker몭s two main business groups.
Forrest Norrod, 49 years old, was most recently vice president in charge of Dell몭s server systems business. Prior to that role, he led an organization that developed custom-tailored servers for companies in the hyperscale market, AMD said. Hyperscale refers to Web services like Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. that serve a profusion of Web pages and consequently buy large numbers of computer servers.
At AMD, Mr. Norrod will take the role of senior vice president and general manager of the business group in charge of enterprise, embedded and semicustom chips. Besides chips for servers, the unit designs chips to order for applications such as the latest Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. videogame systems.
Mr. Norrod will report to Lisa Su, who recently succeeded Rory Read as AMD몭s chief executive. She said in prepared remarks that Mr. Norrod had the unique skills 몮to lead AMD into an expanded set of markets where our differentiated technology assets provide a competitive advantage.몯
AMD, which competes with Intel Corp. for sales of chips using a popular design called x86, once accounted for about a third of server chips using that technology. But its share recently dwindled to less 3%, according to the firm Mercury Research.
Dell veteran Ashley Gorakhpurwalla will assume Mr. Norrod몭s former responsibilities, said Dell spokesperson Jim Hahn in an email. Mr. Norrod몭s last day at the company was Oct. 1, the spokesperson added.
몮Forrest Norrod recently notified Dell of his desire to take some time off and then pursue other opportunities,몯 Mr. Hahn said. 몮We thank him for his contributions and wish him well in future endeavors.몯

It has been 10 years since the comedy 몮Mean Girls몯 and a remake of 몮The Manchurian Candidate몯 starring Denzel Washington played in theaters. But in a New York courtroom last week, they took center stage.
The films were among a group of 25 releases from Paramount Pictures that have been the subject of a nasty court fight, including accusations of dishonesty and fraud. Four investors who were part of a $231 million deal to co-finance the movies멪a 몮slate deal몯 in Hollywood parlance멪are suing to get back part of their $40.1 million investment, all of which was lost in the deal.
몮This language is a lie,몯 said a lawyer for the plaintiffs in opening arguments Tuesday, pointing to a document used by Paramount to sell the deal.
몮Plaintiffs chose this business,몯 countered an attorney for the studio, which is owned by Viacom Inc. 몮It몭s an unpredictable business.몯
Slate deals, which were common in Hollywood about 10 years ago and have recently made a comeback, have generated a lot of lawsuits and behind-the-scenes fights멪though most have been resolved without spilling into the glare of open court.
Paramount has defended itself in four such lawsuits in recent years, more than any other major studio. Two of Paramount몭s cases were settled out of court, and the studio prevailed in a third case that went to trial and was upheld on appeal. The fourth is the one currently in court.
Slate financing deals at Sony Corp.몭s Sony Pictures and Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures몭 also resulted in separate lawsuits. The case involving the Sony deal is ongoing, though the studio isn몭t a party.
A decade ago, hedge funds and other big investors flocked to Hollywood, convinced that by backing not just one but a slate of several dozen films at a major studio they could minimize the risk inherent in the movie business. The hits would offset the flops, or so the thinking went. And with DVD sales booming at the time, the slate financing strategy looked like a safe way to buy a little showbiz glamour.
Most of the deals, however, enjoyed anything but Hollywood endings. DVD sales stopped growing, risky big-budget tentpoles became more common, and the often opaque complexities of film finance멪with fees for studios and talent taken off the top멪and revenue that arrives slowly from a wide variety of sources, resulted in lower profits than some investors had expected. Some quietly left with lighter wallets, but others fought the studios.
몮When it comes to film financing, there몭s always money in an audit,몯 said Clark Hallren, a consultant who was previously a managing director at J.P. Morgan몭s entertainment industries group. 몮The question is whether the additional money you몭ll find is greater than the cost of litigation.몯
Some cases were settled out of the public eye. After hedge fund Elliott Management initiated an audit at Universal over a money-losing slate deal, the two sides agreed last year that the studio would buy back Elliott몭s interest in some of its films, according to people involved in the negotiation.
Slate deals petered out in the wake of the financial crisis of late 2008 and 2009, but have recently returned. Every major studio except Walt Disney Co., which eschews such partnerships, has in the past two years signed or renewed at least one major co-financing arrangement.
The people behind some of those agreements say they learned lessons from deals gone bad in the 2000s and are now taking on less debt and being more selective about the management teams with which they work or films they back.
But such claims have been made in decades past as studios have gone through one wave of financiers after another.
몮The history of these deals is littered with the remains of investors who thought they understood the transaction simply because they succeeded at other businesses,몯 said film financier David Molner, who was a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits against Paramount that was settled.
In the case being argued in New York, Allianz Risk Transfer AG, a unit of German insurance giant Allianz, and three co-plaintiffs are seeking to recover more than $16 million from their original investment, as well as punitive damages. In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan they accused the studio of fraud and unjust enrichment.
The plaintiffs claim that just as they made their deal with Paramount, the studio cut back on its previous practice of selling most foreign rights on its films in advance멪a strategy that offsets risk, but also limits potential upside. Many movies in the slate were box-office duds, and the losses were higher than they would have been if foreign rights had been sold in advance, as the plaintiffs allege they were led to expect.
Paramount has denied the plaintiffs몭 allegations and said it didn몭t promise to pursue any particular amount of 몮foreign pre-sales.몯
Among Paramount몭s earlier lawsuits, the most unusual involved the actor Tommy Lee Jones, a star of the 2007 Oscar- winning movie 몮No Country for Old Men,몯 whose contract entitled him to a bonus if the film hit a certain box-office gross.
A 몮drafting error몯 in the agreement more than tripled the amount the actor was entitled to receive, to $17.5 million from just under $5 million, according to an appeals-court decision on a 2011 lawsuit filed by the Marathon Funding LLC investors group. An attorney for Mr. Jones said an arbitration judge found the contract was legitimate and that his client ultimately received $16 million.
Marathon, which helped finance 몮No Country몯 and 13 other Paramount films in a deal struck in late 2006, accused the studio of dipping into the investment fund for about $2 million to help cover the expense. A California appeals court found in 2013 that Paramount hadn몭t cheated Marathon by using money from the fund.
몮No matter how smart an investor you are, anyone can be taken,몯 said Mr. Hallren. 몮And no one몭s better at doing that than Hollywood.몯

NEW YORK멪The spirits moved 몮Ouija몯 to No. 1 at the box office, with the board-game adaptation leading the weekend with a $20 million debut, according to studio estimates Sunday.
The horror movie release, timed to Halloween, attracted more moviegoers at the North America box office than the Keanu Reeves thriller 몮John Wick.몯 The R-rated hit-man revenge tale from Lions Gate opened with $14.2 million in second place.
Last week몭s top film, the Brad Pitt World War II action film 몮Fury,몯 slid to third with $13 million. In two weeks, the Sony Pictures release has made $46.1 million.
Board-game adaptations such as 몮Ouija몯 have had a checkered history at the box office, with the big-budget 몮Battleship몯멪the last Hasbro game turned into a movie멪famously flopping in 2012. But 몮Oujia,몯 made by Blumhouse Productions and released by Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures, was made for just $5 million, and scared up moviegoers with a micro-budget summoning of brand-name occult.
Two Twentieth Century Fox releases rounded out the domestic top five. David Fincher몭s marital noir 몮Gone Girl,몯 starring Ben Affleck, made $11.1 million in its fourth week, bringing its cumulative total to $124 million. It will soon pass Mr. Fincher몭s 몮Benjamin Button몯 ($127.5 million) to mark the director몭s top box-office hit.
In its second week of release, the animated fantasy 몮The Book of Life몯 earned $9.8 million.
As Hollywood몭s awards season begins to heat up, limited-release titles also made noise at the box office. Easily leading all films in per-screen average were Alejandro Gonz?lez I??rritu몭s black comedy 몮Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),몯 starring Michael Keaton, and the Edward Snowden documentary 몮Citizenfour.몯
Laura Poitras몭 몮Citizenfour몯 drew a $25,000 average opening in five theaters for the Weinstein Co.몭s Radius unit. Expanding to 50 theaters in its second week, Fox Searchlight몭s 몮Birdman몯 took in an average of almost $29,000 per screen.
Fox Searchlight and Twentieth Century Fox parent 21st Century Fox was until last year part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.
Next weekend몭s top film is essentially already decided. Christopher Nolan몭s space travel thriller 몮Interstellar,몯 one of the year몭s most anticipated releases, opens in select theaters Wednesday and then wide on Friday. Mr. Nolan, an ardent advocate for film, is releasing the movie first in about 240 theaters that still project 35mm or 70mm, rather than digital.

Japan몭s Recruit Poised for M&A Splash Overseas; President Says Staffing Company Likely to Buy Marketing Media Firm

TOKYO멪As Japan몭s population shrinks, many firms are seeking further growth overseas through mergers and acquisitions. Poised for its next big deal after successfully relisting its shares just a week ago, Recruit Holdings Co. is no exception.
The listing will help the classified advertisement and human resources company ramp up acquisitions to become the world몭s biggest player in the staffing business by 2020, the company몭s president predicted, citing an investment capacity of about $6.5 billion in the next three to five years.
Masumi Minegishi said Recruit will likely go through with full-scale acquisitions of marketing media companies 몮in the not-so-distant future.몯
Shares of Tokyo-based Recruit, which has a market capitalization of $18 billion that rivals blue-chip firms such as Sony Corp. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., have risen 18% since its IPO in part due to growing expectations for its next M&A steps.
Mr. Minegishi said he is well aware of the mixed feelings of hope and concern that investors have over what the company does next in terms of acquisitions. 몮We몭ve seen a lot of failures in acquisitions made by Japanese companies and some of them pay too much for a target,몯 Mr. Minegishi, who took the helm of the company in 2012, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview Thursday. But 몮we몭ve been successful in past deals,몯 the 50-year-old chief said, citing its two-step M&A approach, in which the Japanese company first makes a smaller investment in a company before deciding whether to make a full-scale acquisition.
Founded in 1960, Recruit started as an employment advertising agency for university newspapers. It expanded rapidly in the era of Japan몭s explosive economic growth of the 1980s, launching publishing enterprises that included a magazine for women looking to change jobs. Despite a bribery scandal and an insider-trading case involving the IPO of a Recruit subsidiary in 1988, Recruit has gained a unique position in the industry as a conglomerate that runs a major staffing firm and a diversified advertising publication business.
Despite its commanding presence throughout Japan, Recruit is a relative newcomer in the world of M&As, largely picking up smaller companies such as U.S. staffing firm CSI Companies in 2010. But in the last four years, it has ramped up its investments overseas, including its acquisitions of U.S.-based Staffmark Holdings and Advantage Resourcing for a combined total of about $700 million and its $1 billion purchase of U.S. job-search website Indeed.com.
몮We are constantly eyeing deals globally and have more than 50 potential targets on our list,몯 Mr. Minegishi said. 몮Our M&A team몭s skills of sourcing (acquisitions) are excellent and it often happens that we have already contacted companies by the time investment banks pitch us deals.몯
Mr. Minegishi said Recruit won몭t just consider making a big acquisition in the staffing business but also online sales promotion firms in the travel, housing and restaurant sectors.
Recruit has made a minority investment in several online services, including U.K. Hotspring Ventures Ltd.멪-a web operator that provides access to health and beauty treatments with listings for spas and salons.

Foreign Companies Are Cooling on China; Slowing Economy, Regulatory Crackdowns Are Forcing Many Multinationals to Scale Back
By Wei Gu

Foreign companies are wielding their axes in China.
For years, multinationals plowed money into China, hoping to benefit from its fast growth. Now, a combination of slower growth there, weak global demand and a feeling that Beijing has singled out foreign businesses for regulatory crackdowns is pushing an increasing number of companies to cut their staffs.
The number of European companies doing business in China that cut staff in the past year rose to 16% this year from 10% in 2012, according to a survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China. Likewise, the number planning to boost permanent staff fell to 48% this year from 61% in 2012.
몮The gold-rush stage is over,몯 said Kirsten Mao, a partner at ManGo Associates, a Chinese recruiting firm. 몮Many multinationals which have overexpanded in China are now in a restructuring mood.몯
The staff reductions are part of a broader cost-cutting wave among foreign companies operating in China. The European Chamber of Commerce survey said 24% of companies plan to cut costs in China in 2014, up from 22% in 2013.
U.S. companies share the same views. In a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce, 27% of American companies in China said they see no investment expansion in the country over the next year, up from 16% last year.
Some multinationals are plagued by woes outside China. Reductions in China at International Business Machines Corp., Sony Corp., Microsoft Corp.몭s Nokia unit and Adobe Systems Inc. are part of global job cuts.
After years of expansion, some are scaling back. Carlyle Group, the alternative asset management company, is laying off about 10 people working on its China growth fund, according to people familiar with the matter. It closed the growth fund몭s Chengdu office last year and is going to trim the growth-fund team in its Shanghai office and consolidate it with the Beijing team.
A spokesman at Carlyle declined to comment.
Some companies are also fleeing what they see as a hostile business environment in China. Almost half of the American firms surveyed believe foreign companies have been singled out in a string of pricing or anticorruption campaigns that have hit pharmaceutical, tech and auto companies recently, according to the American chamber.
China is also losing its advantages as a low-cost country. Financial-services company DTCC Solutions LLC SRO, a unit of U.S.-based Depository Trust and Clearing Corp., is moving its small Shanghai operation to Wales. A number of companies are making similar moves, consolidating offices and tapping into low-cost English-speaking work forces. The company said it is committed to Asia and is expanding in other offices.
Chinese growth, while still strong by developed-country standards, is slowing, and that is hurting company profits. According to the European Chamber of Commerce, only 63% of European companies in China were profitable in 2013, down from 73% in 2011. Revenue-growth expectations for their China operations are at their lowest levels since the peak of the financial crisis, the group says.
Slower investment demand at multinational companies also has hit staffing companies. Ms. Mao몭s search firm, which has eight offices in China, is looking to close an office. After growing by 50% to 60% annually for the past few years, revenue is likely to be flat in the next two years, she expects.
Landlords and others who cater to expatriates have felt the chill. Adam McWhirter, managing director at Maxxelli Real Estate in Chongqing, said housing allowances have fallen or been stripped away in some cases as companies try to hire local talent instead. Kenny Hon, general manager of the Beijing Riviera, an upscale property development, said occupancy has dropped to 84% from 93% last year, as companies like Shell and Nokia cut jobs.
All this gloom is good news for law firms with labor-dispute practices. Chinese law says companies can only do mass layoffs if they haven몭t made a profit for three years or have been unable to pay employees for eight months. If they don몭t meet those criteria, the layoffs can be blocked.
As money gets tighter, foreign companies also are clamping down on spending. A U.S. company laid off 20 people in China for submitting false dental-reimbursement claims, according to Kevin Jones, partner at law firm Faegre Baker Daniels, which advises on employment matters.
Foreign companies몭 pain may be Chinese companies몭 gain. Some are eager to scoop up well-trained local talent from foreign companies. E-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. recently courted local engineers from Nokia by splashing a 몮Nokia, welcome to Alibaba몯 banner across its recruiting website.

* DIC says cash raised to repay debt ahead of schedule
* DIC may pass excess funds from sale to Dubai Holding
By David French
DUBAI, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Dubai International Capital (DIC) should complete the sale of the two main assets remaining in its portfolio within 18 months, which will provide it with cash to cover its outstanding debt well ahead of scheduled repayment in two years.
Proceeds from the divestment of the five remaining assets should also give the private equity firm surplus funds to pass to its parent firm, Dubai Holding, to help finance its ambitious projects in the emirate, chief executive David Smoot said.
Part of the investment vehicle of Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, DIC rose to prominence in the mid-2000s as it took stakes in global brands including Daimler and Sony, and at one point was heavily linked with a takeover of one of England's biggest soccer clubs, Liverpool FC.
However, like many state-linked entities in the Dubai stable, DIC fell prone to overexuberance and the heavy debt load taken on to finance many of its deals, forcing it into a $2.5 billion restructuring which it completed in April 2012.
Since then, DIC has been selling down its entire portfolio of assets to service its debt, most recently offloading German packaging company Mauser for a total consideration of 1.25 billion euros ($1.72 billion).
With around $1 billion of net debt remaining, which excludes cash it has on its balance sheet, the sales of Doncasters, a British-based engineering aerospace group, and German alumina products maker Almatis will give it the funds to comfortably meet its repayment schedule, Smoot told the Reuters Middle East Investment Summit.
"We have a bullet repayment that's due December 31, 2016. We'll finish our task well inside of that deadline." Under a "bullet" structure, the borrower just pays back the interest on a loan during its lifetime and the full amount at the end.
ASSET SALES
The process of grooming Doncasters, the largest asset left on its books, and Almatis for a sale began this summer and deals with respective buyers should be made within 18 months, Smoot said.
"Assets like this should trade for a double-digit multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation)," said Smoot of Doncasters when asked for expected sale value. It generated an EBITDA of 134 million pounds ($216.56 million) in 2013, he added.
Almatis, around 80 percent owned by DIC with a stake also held by Blackstone unit GSO Capital Partners, had an EBITDA of around $100 million, he said, without giving an expected valuation for the firm.
No investment banks have been mandated to advise on either sale but would likely be selected later to help facilitate the transactions, Smoot said. However, a small team that used to work for consultancy Deloitte was hired by DIC to help prepare the assets for divestment last year.
Two smaller assets could be sold before the end of the year, with Bahraini real estate firm Ishraq, which runs a Holiday Inn Express resort in the kingdom, expected to give DIC around $15 million of cash to reduce its debt pile.
The fate of DIC's final asset, a stake in Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, is dependent on the actions of majority shareholder Investment Corporation of Dubai. DAE has a leasing business but also owns StandardAero, which was linked with a multi-billion-dollar tie-up with BBA Aviation last year.
"Certainly when, or if, the asset comes to market, there will be a lot of interest in it", he said of StandardAero, adding there had been a significant improvement in the firm's performance in the last 18 months, including a restructuring of the workforce and its balance sheet.
DIC 2.0
The positive recovery which DIC has achieved matches a number of other Dubai government-linked entities who have rebounded from their debt problems.
But while the likes of property developer Nakheel have been able to repay their restructured obligations early due to the recovery in Dubai's economy, DIC's assets were mostly outside the emirate.
This meant that DIC was reliant on improving the operating performance of its assets, and the strength of the portfolio has allowed it to fulfill obligations to its creditors, Smoot said.
The process of selling off DIC's assets should leave it with additional cash beyond its restructured debt amount, but Smoot ruled out investing in assets of other Dubai Inc entities in the same way that ICD has acquired companies from state firms struggling with their debt burdens.
"We've proven to be good stewards within the Dubai Inc framework and so, from time to time, we have been asked to look at different situations and I'm sure we'll be asked in the future to do the same", said Smoot of the process which market participants have labelled Dubai's asset shuffle.
"Our only focus right now is making sure we shepherd our remaining assets to a successful conclusion."
However, DIC would be open to channelling cash to its parent firm, Dubai Holding, to help fund a raft of new projects, including plans to build an entertainment district that will include the world's largest shopping mall.
"How much (cash) I don't know but I'm sure it'll be much appreciated by Dubai Holding as they have other uses for the capital."
Smoot said it was too early to define exactly what DIC would look like after the asset sales, although investment advisory or raising cash from third parties to fund new deals were two potential areas of interest.
"You'd want to have multiple partners supporting your business, so you're not overall dependent on a single one, and you'd want to shy away from borrowing money, particularly to fund long-term, illiquid equity investments."
"So that suggests DIC 2.0 is going to look very different from the prior one."

SONY
Smartphone Sales Target Could Drop
Sony Corp. is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, as the business struggles in the face of fierce competition멪especially in emerging markets.
The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43 million for the 12 months ending March 2015, those people said. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50 million, which many analysts said at the time was too optimistic.
The expected revision stems from Sony몭s plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets.

GENERAL DYNAMICS
Defense Contractor Reports Robust Quarter
General Dynamics Corp. on Wednesday reported forecast-beating quarterly profits and increased its 2014 guidance, with signs that orders for its core combat and information technology units have bottomed out.
The company also said it would secure very strong orders for its Gulfstream Aerospace business jets in the fourth quarter, and moved to calm analysts몭 concerns that new models introduced last week could cannibalize sales of its existing lineup.
General Dynamics몭 stock has been the best performer among U.S. aerospace and defense peers this year, driven largely by the contribution of Gulfstream and restructuring efforts that have improved the profitability of its core defense operations.
General Dynamics reported a profit of $696 million for the third quarter compared with $651 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose to $2.06 from $1.84, well ahead of the $1.91 analysts몭 consensus. Revenue edged up 0.2% to $7.75 billion.

Mini Cooper몭s Fuel Economy Will Be Lowered
BMW AG will reduce the advertised fuel economy of four 2014 Mini Cooper models after an audit by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that the original values were inflated.
The agency has been stepping up its review of the mileage values submitted by auto makers after earlier audits found that the manufacturer-reported mileage claims exceeded the values the agency obtained in its own lab tests. Hyundai Motor Co., Ford Motor Co. and Daimler AG몭s Mercedes-Benz brand have recently revised mileage ratings for certain cars after EPA questioned the original values.
In BMW몭s case, EPA said city, highway or combined mileage estimates for four 2014 Mini Cooper models were overstated by as much as four miles per gallon.

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO
Revenue Fizzles for Lucky Strike Maker
British American Tobacco PLC on Wednesday reported a big fall in nine-month revenue, blaming a slow recovery in Western Europe and pressure on the disposable incomes of consumers in all its big markets.
The maker of Lucky Strike, Dunhill and Kent cigarettes said revenue fell 9.6% in the nine months to Sept. 30, largely because of currency weakness in its major markets.
BAT said cigarette volumes declined 1% in the period, compared with a fall of 3.2% a year earlier. The company said growth in the Middle East, Pakistan and Ukraine failed to make up for falling demand in Russia, Vietnam and Brazil.
몮Although currency movements impacted our reported results, the group continues to perform well and we are on track to deliver another year of good earnings growth,몯 Chief Executive Nicandro Durante said.

Japanese stocks surged for a second time this week, rebounding from a big drop Tuesday, while Hong Kong shares gained for a fourth straight day after the government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks for the first time Tuesday.
Asian markets got a boost from a sharp rise in Wall Street shares overnight, driven by strong quarterly results from Apple and news that the European Central Bank is considering further stimulus.
The Nikkei Stock Average led gains in the region, jumping 2.6% to 15195.77, as the dollar moved back above ?107.
The latest read on Japanese exports showed a rise of 6.9% from a year earlier in September, helped by a weaker yen and a surge in output among suppliers of components for Apple몭s new smartphones. Still, Japan몭s trade deficit edged up 1.6% from a year earlier to ?958.3 billion ($8.96 billion), the first increase in three months.
Stocks in Japan have had a rough run lately, with big declines last week sending the Nikkei into correction territory, down more than 10% from a late-September peak. On Tuesday the Nikkei lost 2%, after it gained 4% Monday.
The Nikkei tends to rise when the yen falls, because a weaker yen is generally positive for earnings at Japan몭s exporters. The dollar has backtracked against the yen in October after gaining earlier in the year. Midday Wednesday in New York, the greenback was at ?107.28, up from ?107 late Tuesday.
Shares of Japanese shippers were strong, as the Baltic Dry Index of freight rates rose for a third straight session to a one-month high. Nippon Yusen added 4.3% and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines gained 5.4%.
Sony rose 3.4% following reports it will exit its low-end, emerging-market-oriented smartphone business and on news that activist investor Third Point had sold its Sony stock.
Fujifilm Holdings gained 4.1% after a Nikkei report that the company is likely to book a 20% on-year rise in group operating profit for the April-September fiscal half, to around ?70 billion, as its digital camera business moved out of the red. The firm is also enjoying positive exposure as the developer of Avigan, currently in demand as an Ebola treatment.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to 23403.97, pushing it to a month-to-date gain of 2.05% despite protests that have hurt the city몭s retailers and other businesses.
The government and pro-democracy student leaders held official talks Tuesday, but there was no agreement over how the city몭s chief executive should be elected.
Australia몭s S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.1% to 5385.90, its seventh consecutive rise, putting the index back in positive territory for the year.
BHP Billiton was up 1.5% after the company reported strong petroleum and metallurgical-coal production and solid iron-ore output figures for the September quarter. Rio Tinto gained 2.1%, while fellow iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals added 3.1%.
Australia몭s largest banks all advanced, climbing between 0.5% and 1.3%. The earnings season for the lenders kicks off next week with National Australia Bank몭s full-year results.
South Korea몭s Kospi climbed 1.1% to 1936.97.
Hyundai Motor fell 4.2% ahead of its third-quarter report. The firm is expected to post a net profit of 1.87 trillion won ($1.77 billion), down 17% from a year earlier, while sales likely fell 12% to 20.57 trillion won, according to a Wall Street Journal poll.
In India, the S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.8% to 26787.23, its fourth straight rise.

Daniel Loeb, Third Point Exit  Sony  Investment

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Daniel Loeb was a persistent thorn in Sony Corp.'s side for more than a year, but the investor's hedge fund, Third Point, no longer has a stake in the troubled technology maker.
After trying and failing to pressure Sony to spin off its entertainment division into a separate company, Loeb gradually lowered Third Point's position. At the time, the activist investor slammed Sony Pictures' greenlighting process for producing expensive flops such as "White House Down" and "After Earth."
Even though Sony did not embrace his suggestions and the company expects to lose more than $2 billion for the fiscal year, it was a profitable investment for Third Point. The hedge fund generated a 20% return on its investment, Loeb wrote in an investor letter.
He also praised Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai for cutting costs, transitioning out of the personal computer business, overhauling its television division and increasing transparency, but did sound a note of caution.
"They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company's fortunes," Loeb wrote.
At one point, Third Point was Sony's largest investor with a 7% stake, but by February had shifted its position between shares and swaps, falling out of the company's top 10 investors.
Loeb also wrote that Third Point had purchased "a significant position" in online auction company eBay during the third quarter, has continued to invest in AliBaba following its public offering last summer, and thinks PayPal has opportunities for growth despite the debut of Apple Pay and increased competition in the mobile retail world.

 Sony  Is Looking to Cut Smartphone Sales Target Again

TOKYO멪Sony is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday, as the business struggles to perform as expected in the face of fierce competition especially in emerging markets.
The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43 million for the 12 months to the end of March 2015. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50 million, which many analysts said was too optimistic.
The planned move stems from Sony몭s plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets.
Sony disappointed investors in September when it announced it would write down ?180 billion ($1.68 billion) of the smartphone segment몭s business value and lowered the earnings forecast for the current business year to a ?230 billion net loss, almost five times what it said previously.
For Sony watchers, the latest plan won몭t come as much of a surprise, as company executives, including chief executive Kazuo Hirai, have been signaling it will downsize its smartphone business in some countries after concluding that introducing entry-level models for emerging markets was a mistake. Sony plans to hold a meeting with investors in November, and Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said details of how it will update the smartphone business plan would be unveiled there.
Sony몭s Xperia smartphone business was once a star player for the company, but is now experiencing trouble. It has been hit by the emergence of Chinese makers of cheap handsets, while it continues to struggle in competition against market leaders such as Apple and Samsung.
The Xperia will remain a core business for the company along with image sensors and the gaming business, but Mr. Yoshida has said at news conferences that the smartphone segment will focus on high-end models and won몭t seek a major share of the global market.
Mr. Hirai said in September that Sony would cut 1,000 employees, or 15% of the global smartphone business workforce, by March. Some analysts said the cut wasn't enough to turn around the segment.
Sony announces its earnings result for the July-September period on Oct. 31. While analysts expect a net loss due to the ?180 billion smartphone charges, they say it is unlikely the company will again revise down the earnings forecast for the year for the company as a whole.
New York hedge-fund firm Third Point LLC, which unsuccessfully sought a partial spinoff of Sony몭s entertainment business, said Tuesday said that it had sold its stake in Sony for a return of nearly 20%, saying in a letter to its investors that 몮more urgency몯 was necessary to 몮definitively turn around the company몭s fortunes.몯

Amgen: $100 Billion Activist Target; Dan Loeb Urges Biotech Firm to Take Steps to Unlock Value

Another $100 billion company is on an activist investor몭s chopping block.
Daniel Loeb몭s Third Point LLC has taken a stake in biotechnology giant Amgen Inc. and wants it to explore breaking in two, according to a letter sent to Third Point몭s investors Tuesday.
The New York hedge-fund firm said it is one of Amgen몭s largest shareholders and has been engaged in constructive talks with the company, which has a market capitalization of roughly $109 billion.
몮We firmly believe that the company is at an inflection point,몯 Third Point said in its letter.
Activist investors this year have called on a number of companies to consider breaking up, including PepsiCo Inc., eBay Inc. and Darden Restaurants Inc. They argue that businesses perform better when they are narrowly focused.
몮It is well established that disparate business units generally benefit from operating separately,몯 Third Point said.
The firm said Amgen can unlock value by streamlining its research-and-development process and cutting its 몮bloated cost structure,몯 but Third Point also wants Amgen몭s board to consider the 몮more radical몯 option of breaking up. Third Point suggested potentially splitting apart the company몭s mature business from its faster-growing operations, an idea proposed earlier by Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges.
In a statement, Amgen said it 몮has always appreciated the perspectives of all of its shareholders, including Third Point, and welcomes constructive input toward our common goal of enhancing shareholder value.몯 The company plans to update investors on its priorities and restructuring plans at an investor day next Tuesday.
Third Point said Amgen몭s stock could get to $218 a share by the end of 2017 if the company completed the work on costs and R&D. But if the company went forward with a split, Third Point believes the stock could be worth $249 a share in two years.
Amgen shares rose 4.8% to close at $144.09 Tuesday, touching an all-time high in the process, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Third Point had a stake in the company. Amgen몭s stock is up 150% over the past three years and 26% this year.
Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., helped pioneer the biotechnology-drugs business, but the medicines that propelled its growth are aging and some are facing the threat of low-cost competition. Robert Bradway, a former Morgan Stanley health-care investment banker, became chief executive in 2012 to help turn around the company. Last year, he orchestrated a $10.4 billion deal to buy Onyx Pharmaceuticals and its blood-cancer drug, Kyprolis.
While some analysts have been disappointed by Kyprolis sales, Amgen is betting that new studies will result in additional uses that can drive more sales.
Meanwhile, the company몭s laboratories have been criticized on Wall Street for failing to find new drugs. Amgen executives believe the company몭s drug pipeline has turned a corner, and they몭ve touted study results from three cancer drugs and two cardiovascular medicines, including a cholesterol-lowering drug that is expected to be a blockbuster seller.
Mr. Bradway in July announced plans to cut costs by closing some facilities and laying off 12% to 15% of Amgen몭s employees. The company has said the cost savings are earmarked for potential sources of new growth, such as the cholesterol drug.
The stock has risen sharply since those announcements, and Third Point applauded the moves on Tuesday.
Amgen is the first new investment Third Point has disclosed since the firm raised $2.5 billion in about two weeks this August. The firm, which now has about $17.5 billion in total assets, told investors it planned to use the cash to take activist stakes in several large companies in the U.S. and abroad.
Amgen isn몭t the only company Third Point has urged to explore a split. The company last year disclosed a stake in Sony Corp. and pushed the company to spin off its entertainment business.
Sony rejected Third Point몭s call for a breakup and instead cut costs and made management changes within the entertainment business. In its letter Tuesday, Third Point praised those moves and said it has sold its Sony stake for a return of nearly 20%, though it said 몮more urgency몯 is necessary to 몮definitively turn around the company몭s fortunes.몯

UPDATE 3-Third Point's Loeb urges breakup of biotech company Amgen

BOSTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb told investors on Tuesday he urged U.S. biotechnology company Amgen Inc to split into two separate businesses, a move he said could boost its share price by more than 80 percent.
"Our own extensive diligence suggests that a breakup of Amgen is feasible and that purported constraints such as tax strategy and supply chain management can be managed," he said in a quarterly letter sent to investors by his Third Point hedge fund.
Loeb, who ranks among the industry's most closely followed investors - returning an average 17.5 percent per year since 1996 - also said Third Point made new bets on eBay Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, while exiting other holdings such as Sony Corp.
The letter said Amgen, in which Third Point is an investor, has "all the hallmarks of a hidden value situation."
It added that investors would likely welcome a split into what Third Point calls MatureCo and GrowthCo.
Loeb, who has been making more activist bets and is known to lob sharply worded directives at underperforming chief executives, called Amgen CEO Bob Bradway open-minded and receptive to the idea of a split.
Amgen, the world's largest biotech company by sales, needs to improve its research and development evaluation, Third Point said, adding that recent cost cuts did not even scratch the surface.
Amgen said it appreciates the perspectives of all of its shareholders, including Third Point.
"The board and management continually assess Amgen's strategic priorities - and, when appropriate, take action - to set the best path forward to increase shareholder value," the company said.
Amgen has scheduled a business update for investors and analysts on Oct. 28 at which it will provide details on the restructuring plans it announced in July.
Third Point recently created a Scientific and Medical Advisory Board led by oncologist Dr. David Agus, the former doctor of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. The board will help evaluate therapeutic companies and their clinical assets.
The letter also touched on this month's wild equity market swings, which have been partly blamed on hedge funds.
Third Point said it still likes investing in the United States and is betting that "large-cap opportunities with a constructivist angle will become more promising."
The hedge fund had cut its exposures over the last week, but has now taken new positions and returned to stocks it still likes but sold earlier at much higher prices.
Amgen shares rose $6.58, or 4.8 percent, to close at $144.09 on Nasdaq.

Chinese Smartphones Lift Japan몭s Electronics Business; Japanese Parts Makers Tap Surging Demand; Murata, TDK Benefit

KYOTO, Japan멪China몭s smartphone boom is being fueled by an unlikely source: Japanese parts makers.
Upstart Chinese phone makers like Xiaomi Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. are increasingly undercutting smartphone giants like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. with high-performance, low-cost handsets.
A significant portion of those handsets몭 guts멪as much as 50% by value, in some cases멪is made by Japanese companies like Murata Manufacturing Co. or TDK Corp. Those parts range from displays and Wi-Fi modules to tiny, energy-storing ceramic capacitors.
몮Almost all cellphone manufacturers are our customers,몯 said Tsuneo Murata, president of Murata, which makes capacitors and other components. 몮The pie for the component demand is growing.몯
The parts sales are a rare bright spot in Japan몭s gloomy electronics industry, and China몭s smartphone market멪the world몭s largest and growing at 19% a year, according to Counterpoint Research멪is a big factor. Sales there are being fueled by cutthroat competition among dozens of brands, some of which offer smartphones at less than $100. Lower prices mean smaller budgets for parts, but Japanese suppliers often provide a larger share of components to Chinese brands than to Apple or Samsung, analysts say.
In the second quarter of this year, Xiaomi leapfrogged Apple and Samsung to become the best-selling smartphone provider in China, according to Canalys, a research firm. Counterpoint says Chinese brands will capture about three-quarters of the domestic market this year, in terms of volume, up from one-third in 2010.
Chinese companies are boosting purchases of Japanese parts as they push beyond the domestic market, in order to upgrade their phones. In some Chinese-branded phones, Japanese suppliers provide up to half of the parts by value, said Daiki Takayama, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Another Chinese smartphone maker, ZTE Corp., buys displays from Sharp Corp. of Japan for its high-end phones, along with camera modules from Sony Corp., said Lu Qianhao, head of the company몭s handset marketing strategy. He cited technological know-how, manufacturing expertise and quality control as advantages of Japanese suppliers.
By contrast, Japanese suppliers account for about one-third of the bill of materials for the latest iPhones, and less than that for Samsung phones, said Shoji Sato, an analyst at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.
Even phone-screen maker Japan Display Inc., whose shares plunged last week after it predicted a loss this fiscal year because of delays in shipments to Apple, says that it expects sales to Chinese smartphone makers to nearly triple to ?180 billion ($1.68 billion) during the same period.
Japan Display makes liquid-crystal displays for smartphones and tablet computers, one of the most competitive areas in the parts business, in which rivals like LG Display Co. of South Korea have been making inroads. Suppliers like Murata that dominate hard-to-copy niches are doing better.
Murata, which is based in Kyoto, built on a long tradition of ceramics-making in Japan몭s former capital to hone its specialization in capacitors and related components.
The company몭s latest capacitors are not much bigger than a grain of sand, but they contain about 100 layers of ceramics, and Murata uses proprietary machines and methods to make them.
몮It몭s like making a good mille-feuille,몭몭 Mr. Takayama said. 몮You can buy a very high-quality egg, the best vanilla essence or whatever, but nobody else knows how to mix it or how long to bake it.몯
Because Murata is the world몭s largest supplier of capacitors for phones, with a 35% share, it can assure manufacturers of a reliable supply, analysts say. That is important given the tight schedules of the smartphone business.
Capacitors cost pennies or less, but state-of-the-art handsets contain 700 to 800 of them멪three or four times as many as in previous generations of smartphones, the company says.
Mr. Sato estimated that Murata sells $2 to $3 worth of parts to most Chinese smartphone makers per handset. Given that Xiaomi alone has forecast shipments of 60 million phones in 2014 and 100 million next year, that is a solid source of revenue. Apple, which uses more capacitors, as well as other parts that Chinese makers don몭t generally source from Murata, buys about $9 to $10 worth of Murata parts for every iPhone, Mr. Sato estimated.
Murata몭s sales of parts to smartphone makers and other suppliers of communications gear rose about 90% over the past five years, to ?430 billion in the year ended March 31, boosting overall sales by about 60%, to ?847 billion.
The Kyoto area, also home to parts makers like Rohm Semiconductor, Nidec Corp. and Kyocera Corp., has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Chinese smartphone boom. TDK, which is based in Tokyo and makes capacitors and other parts, says its sales to Chinese smartphone makers rose 50% in the April-June quarter.
The push to automate smartphone assembly plants in China, including those making phones for non-Chinese brands, is providing a further boost to Japanese suppliers. Fanuc Corp., a maker of industrial robots that is based in the shadow of Mount Fuji, in September sharply upgraded its forecast for sales and earnings in the financial year ending in March by 29% and 26%, respectively.
Katsushi Saito, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said increased orders for plants owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which operates under the trade name Foxconn Technology Group and is a major assembler of Apple and Xiaomi phones, was the likely reason.
A spokesman for Fanuc said he couldn몭t disclose the names of the company몭s clients. Apple didn몭t respond to a request for comment. Xiaomi and Foxconn declined to comment.
Much of the growth in demand for parts this year was linked to China몭s rollout of high-speed networks and the handsets that operate on them.
Japanese parts suppliers have also benefited from the recent weakness of the Japanese yen, which reduces a price gap with competitors in South Korea and China.
Like other parts suppliers, Murata is looking beyond the boom in Chinese smartphones to new markets like wearable technology, as well as existing industries with a growing appetite for precision electronics parts, such as the automotive and health-care businesses, Mr. Murata said.

Globalfoundries Inc. has agreed to takeover the semiconductor operations of International Business Machines Corp., which is effectively acknowledging the rising cost of chip making is too burdensome.
The two companies did not state the financial details of the transaction, but IBM will pay Globalfoundries $1.5 billion to take the chip operations off its hands, according to a person familiar with the situation.
The big technology company has long had losses on its semiconductor operations, which produce chips for IBM computers and for some external customers. IBM began talking to potential buyers early this year, with Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. as well as Globalfoundries participating in the discussions, people familiar with the matter said last spring.
IBM initially hoped to sell the operations for more than $2 billion, the people said, but bidders were coming in closer to $1 billion. Talks with Globalfoundries at times were marked by disagreements over financial terms, one person familiar with the talks said.
Though IBM has been a pioneer in advancing semiconductor technology, the company몭s manufacturing capability fell behind others that produced chips in large volume. IBM for years produced chips used in videogame consoles but lost that business for the latest generations of hardware from Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
G. Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at VLSI Research, said one likely reason for IBM to pay Globalfoundries in the transaction is the cost of either operating IBM facilities to produce the specialized chips it needs for its computers or adapting Globalfoundries factories to make them.
Still, 몮you would think that IBM would have gotten cash for it, not the other way around,몯 Mr. Hutcheson said.
Globalfoundries, which manufactures chips to order for other companies, emerged as the most likely candidate in part because of geography. Most of the relevant IBM operations are in New York state.
Globalfoundries, which is owned by entities associated with the government of Abu Dhabi, has built a large factory near Albany. It also runs former manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in Germany and plants in Asia that were acquired along with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.
The company몭s chief executive is Sanjay Jha, who took the job in January. He had previously run Motorola Mobility LLC and had served for years as a senior executive of Qualcomm Inc.
IBM produces chips from plants in East Fishkill, N.Y., and Burlington, Vt.

몬Fury몭 Chases Away 몬Gone Girl몭 at Box Office; World War II Drama Took in $23.5 Million, Leading a Cluster of Weak Debuts for Several New Films

Three films catering to three different audiences premiered at the box office this weekend, but none turned out enough viewers to qualify as a runaway hit.
The World War II drama 몮Fury몯 rolled into the top spot with an estimated $23.5 million, while the animated film 몮The Book of Life몯 collected $17 million to take third place. The latest adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks romance novel, 몮The Best of Me,몯 opened with few sparks itself, grossing $10.2 million in a fifth-place debut.
몮Fury,몯 starring Brad Pitt as a tank commander in the final days of the war, opened lower than some expected, but could benefit from the longer shelf life typically seen for adult dramas at movie theaters. Its opening is comparable to that of 몮The Monuments Men,몯 another World War II drama that went on to gross $78 million earlier this year.
몮Fury,몯 released by Sony Corp.몭s Columbia Pictures and co-financed by QED International, had a final cost of about $68 million.
몮People who might not have been the target audience are quite surprised by the film,몯 said Rory Bruer, Sony몭s president of worldwide distribution. About 60% of the opening-weekend audience were men.
몮The Book of Life,몯 which sets a romance against the Mexican holiday of D?a de Los Muertos, is the second feature film from the Reel FX Inc. animation studio and had a budget of $50 million. Produced by Guillermo del Toro and featuring the voices of Channing Tatum and Zoe Saldana, the movie received an A- grade from audiences, according to the CinemaScore market research firm.
The movie was distributed by Twentieth Century Fox, whose parent company, 21st Century Fox Inc., was until recently part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.
The opening for 몮Best of Me몯 is the worst yet for the Nicholas Sparks brand. 몮Best of Me,몯 distributed by Relativity Media LLC with a budget of $26 million, stars James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan as star-crossed high school sweethearts who rekindle a romance years later.
The weak opening for 몮Best of Me몯 is an outlier among adaptations of the author몭s romance novels, which have been reliable box-office performers since 2004몭s 몮The Notebook몯 grossed $81 million and went on to become a cultural juggernaut thanks to a second life on cable and home video. But the opening for 몮The Best of Me몯 is less than half of that seen in the debut weekend of Relativity몭s last Nicholas Sparks release, last year몭s 몮Safe Haven.몯
몮We have had great success with Nicholas Sparks over the years and are always glad to be in business with him,몯 a Relativity spokesperson said, adding the studio expects the film to play well in coming weeks.
Meanwhile, Fox몭s holdover hit 몮Gone Girl몯 collected an additional $17.8 million, bringing its three-week total to $107.1 million.
Director Jason Reitman몭s 몮Men, Women & Children,몯 a look at social-media mores released by Viacom Inc.몭s Paramount Pictures, didn몭t connect with audiences upon wide release, grossing only $320,000 in 608 locations.

Streaming-Platform Roku Wants to Sell Video Ads
Video-streaming platform Roku already distributes content from more than 1,800 different partners through set-top boxes and connected TVs. Now it wants to sell video ads alongside that content, too.
Since the beginning of the year, the company has been quietly building its own video ad network; aggregating inventory from a range of the 몮channels몯 available on its platform, packaging it and offering it up for sale to marketers and agencies. It몭s a model reminiscent of the one commonly employed by cable-TV companies, whereby cable-TV networks typically allow their distribution partners to sell two or three minutes of their ad time each hour.
몮There are lots of ad-supported business models coming onto our platform now. We decided there was a lot more work we could be doing to help our partners with monetization,몯 Scott Rosenberg, Roku몭s vice president of business development, said in an interview.
Major ad-supported channels on Roku currently include Hulu, Vevo, Sony-backed Crackle, and those operated by major networks such as Fox, CBS, A&E, and the History Channel, for example. Mr. Rosenberg declined to disclose which channels Roku currently sells ads for, per its agreements with those companies, but said it represents ad space for both large and small channels on its platform.
According to Mr. Rosenberg, Roku works carefully alongside its partners몭 sales teams to avoid any conflict, but its proposition is different to what its channel partners offer. Marketers can몭t usually work with Roku to buy their way into specific shows, for example. Rather, Roku sells packages of ad space that it promises will reach a specific audience demographic across multiple channels. Its own data can be used to help inform those ad placements, it says.
몮Generally we몭re not interested in selling specific channels or content. Our pitch is scale,몯 he said. 몮Brands and agencies are often looking for broad-based buys across multiple channels on Roku.몯

Mobile App Snapchat
Launches Advertisements
Snapchat, the mobile app that lets users send vanishing messages, introduced ads to its service this weekend.
In a blog post published Friday, the company said it will place an ad in the 몮Recent Updates몯 section of its application.
몮The best advertisements tell you more about stuff that actually interests you. Some companies spend a lot of time and collect a lot of data about you to figure that out,몯 the blog post read, adding, 몮The product we몭re releasing today is a lot simpler. An advertisement will appear in your Recent Updates from time to time, and you can choose if you want to watch it. No biggie. It goes away after you view it or within 24 hours, just like Stories.몯
Snapchat said it won몭t place ads in users몭 personal communications, and that they won몭t be 몮creepy and targeted,몯 referencing the behaviorally informed ads now sold by the vast majority of online advertising and media companies.
And in case there was any doubt as to why Snapchat is introducing ads, 몮We need to make money,몯 the company몭s post explained.

Programmatic Spending
Is Expected to Increase
Automated or 몮programmatic몯 display ad spending in the U.S. will grow 137.1% in 2014, representing $10 billion in total spend or 45% of the U.S. digital display ad market, according to new predictions by eMarketer.
By 2016 over $20 billion of ads will be purchased through programmatic ad systems, eMarketer reckons, accounting for 63% of all ad dollars spent on digital display ads.
In 2014, mobile programmatic will account for 44% of total US display ad spending, growing to 56.2% in 2015. Programmatic video ad investment is expected to grow at a slower rate, however. By 2016, just 40% of digital video ads will be purchased programmatically, eMarketer said.

Brad Pitt's 'Fury' all the rage at U.S., Canada box office

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Brad Pitt's gritty World War Two drama "Fury" conquered all box office foes over the weekend, ringing up $23.5 million in ticket sales at theaters in the United States and Canada.
"Fury" kicked two-time box office leader "Gone Girl" into second place, with the thriller, which stars Ben Affleck, collecting $17.8 million from Friday through Sunday, according to data from tracking firm Rentrak.
Animated movie "The Book of Life" earned the No. 3 spot, with a debut of $17 million.
In "Fury", Pitt plays a hardened war veteran who leads men overcome by fatigue and traveling by tank in Nazi Germany during the final months of World War II. Actors Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena and Logan Lerman also star in the film.
"Gone Girl", the big-screen adaptation of a best-selling book, features Affleck as a writer who becomes a suspect when his wife disappears.
"The Book of Life" draws on Mexican art and wooden puppets to animate a colorful love story rooted in the Mexican Day of the Dead festivities. It follows childhood friends Manolo (Diego Luna), Joaquin (Channing Tatum) and Maria (Zoe Saldana).

'Fury' Enters New Battle Zone: The Oscar Race

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Sony's "Fury" arrives in theaters Friday with critical approval and positive box office predictions. As for awards, the WWII drama's outstanding artisan work could enlist it in this year's race.
Writer-director David Ayer and his team - including cinematographer Roman Vasyanov, production designer Andrew Menzies, composer Steve Price, editors Jay Cassidy and Dody Dorn, hair/makeup person Alessandro Bertolazzi, supervising sound editor, Paul N.J. Ottoson, and sound mixer Lisa Pinero - are likely to stir up enthusiasm within the guilds, as well as from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences' below-the-line branches.
Beyond that? It depends on the quality of the upcoming, unseen, films. But word of mouth on "Fury's" below-the-line work will encourage voters in other guilds and AMPAS categories to see the film, which is an important factor during these months when voters are being flooded with viewing options.
Logan Lerman seems an outside possibility in the supporting-actor contest; Brad Pitt, despite a strong performance, may have too subtle a role for this year's crowded actor race.
After its domestic launch, "Fury" makes its European bow Sunday as the closer of the BFI London Film Festival. The dates are similar to Sony's rollout last year for "Captain Phillips," smart timing that gave voters an opportunity to see the film in advance of the fourth-quarter rush of contenders. "Captain Phillips" scored six Oscar noms, including best picture.
Considering the current headlines, will a war film be a tough sell to voters? Sony needs to remind folks that they may have seen a lot of Yanks-vs-Nazis films, but this one is different, thanks to Ayer's meticulous filmmaking. Yes, it's about war, but it's also about fellowship, compassion and faith, and it keeps the adrenaline pumping as it weighs these matters.
Another possible advantage: World War II is part of Hollywood's DNA.
Exhibit A: Even before Pearl Harbor, studio toppers ordered scripts to stir up public support for the war. During the war and in the 70 years since, it's been the setting for a gazillion films, much more than any other war before or since. Exhibit B: Eight WWII movies have won best picture (and that's not counting "The Sound of Music" and "The King's Speech," where the war was background, but key to the plot). In comparison, the best-pic roster includes just three for WWI, two for Vietnam, one for the Civil War, one for the Mideast, and zero for endless other wars throughout history.
That familiarity could be a liability, but in the case of "Fury," it's an asset. Audiences (and voters) bring immediate emotional connections to WWII, but not too much connection (latter is the case with depictions of Mideast conflicts). We don't need heavy exposition for WWII; heroes and villains are clear-cut. In addition, the look and battle methods of WWII seem more cinematic than most other wars (in the same way that boxing is for some reason more movie-friendly than skiing or tennis).
A trio of films this year - "Fury," "The Imitation Game" and "Unbroken," not to mention the pre-war "The Grand Budapest Hotel" - are reminders that there are still new ways to tell WWII stories. Like the heroes in "Fury," the team is fighting for survival in a chaotic situation. But the Ayer force may save the day.

UPDATE 3-Online growth prospects help Japan's Recruit shine in market debut

* Shares up 7.4 pct as broader market slips
* Recruit is one of the world's top 5 staffing firms
* Adept at turning publishing businesses into web products
* Other major listings in Tokyo this year have flopped (Updates closing share price)
By Thomas Wilson
TOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Staffing firm Recruit Holdings Co Ltd surged in its market debut in Tokyo on Thursday, with investors leaping at a rare opportunity to grab part of a big Japanese company with strong online growth prospects.
The 7 percent climb in its share price came amid a decline for the overall market and snapped a string of weak high-profile listings in Tokyo this year. It values the company at around $18 billion - on par with Sony Corp and more than Switzerland's Adecco, the world's biggest staffing firm by sales.
Particularly appealing for investors is Recruit's wide range of businesses including magazines and its aggressive expansion both overseas and into web-based products like real estate listings and second-hand car sales.
"It has been able to meld its traditional publishing business with its web-based products well and that implies high prospects for growth," said Masayuki Doshida, a senior market analyst at Rakuten Securities.
Doshida cited travel magazine Jalan as one such example. It now has its own website offering customers the ability to book travel tickets, hotels and rent cars across Japan.
A tightening labour market as Japan's population rapidly ages and a shift by companies towards using more temporary workers is also expected to work in Recruit's favour.
ACQUISITION HUNGRY
Its shares closed at 3,330 yen, compared with an IPO price of 3,100 yen.
Its IPO, the second-largest in Japan this year, raised roughly $2 billion, with about half of those funds going to the company for further acquisitions and half to existing shareholders.
With ambitions to become the world's biggest staffing firm by 2020, Recruit has in recent years snapped up rivals such as U.S. staffing service CSI, Advantage Resourcing and Staffmark Holdings as well as Indeed.com.
It has over 100 human resources affiliates, roughly evenly split between Japan and overseas.
But the global staffing market is highly fragmented and in terms of just staffing-related revenue, Recruit ranked no. 5 in the world in 2012 with a 1.5 percent market share. That compares to 6.5 percent for Adecco, according to Staffing Industry Analysts.
The bigger market cap for Recruit may lie in its higher profit margins. Its margin for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the last financial year was 15 percent, compared to around 5 percent for Adecco.
Founded in 1960 by Hiromasa Ezoe, a Tokyo University student, Recruit grew rapidly but stumbled in the late 1980s, when it became the centre of a shares-for-favors corruption scandal that brought down the Japanese government.
Recruit made 1.2 trillion yen ($11 billion) in operating revenue in the past financial year, an increase of 13.6 percent, helped by its Indeed.com unit and a favourable exchange rate. But net income declined 9 percent as operating expenses increased.
Weak listings on the Tokyo bourse this year included a $3 billion offering by smartphone screen maker Japan Display that suffered as investors fretted about falling product prices and its ability to compete in Asia.
A $700 million IPO by restaurant chain Skylark Co this month also received a lukewarm welcome as its longer-term growth prospects are less than clear and the listing was seen primarily as an opportunity for owner Bain Capital to cash out.

Japan Display Shares Drop 18%; Outlook Downgrade Blamed on Market Competition, Shipment Delays to Apple Inc.

TOKYO멪Shares of Japan Display Inc. sank 18% Thursday, just a day after it announced a much bigger downward revision to its earnings outlook than analysts had expected.
After the market closed Wednesday, Japan Display said it now predicted a loss of ?10 billion ($95 million) in the year ending in March, instead of a ?26.8 billion net profit previously expected. It blamed fierce market competition and delays of shipments to Apple Inc., whose business accounts for nearly one-third of Japan Display몭s revenue.
몮The magnitude of earnings revisions was much larger than expected,몯 J.P. Morgan analyst Narci Chang wrote in a letter to clients. The brokerage slashed the company몭s price target to ?350 from ?770, putting it at underweight. 몮We expect share price momentum to stay weak,몯 Ms. Chang wrote.
Shares of the world몭s leading display maker fell 18.22% to ?359 at the market close from the previous day. They listed at ?900 on the Tokyo exchange in March this year.
Japan Display was formed two years ago through a merger of the LCD units of Sony Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp., with the help of the government-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, which owns a 35% stake.
A Japan Display official who asked not to be named said the company couldn몭t secure enough parts to produce displays with the quality requested by Apple. That was consistent with what analysts had been saying, noting that production of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is more than six weeks behind schedule.
Also weighing on Japan Display몭s earnings was a one-time cost of ?7 billion from the planned closure of an inefficient factory in Saitama prefecture north of Tokyo.
Many investors had expected the firm to slash its earnings forecast given the severe competition, especially in the Chinese market. But they said they hadn몭t anticipated the scale of the cut. That is leading to uncertainty about the company몭s ability to accurately forecast its business outlook.
몮Given the very low credibility of its guidance, the stock may have further downside risk,몯 said Jefferies equity analyst Atul Goyal, noting that Wednesday몭s cut was fourth since the company몭s initial public offering.
In its statement, the Tokyo-based manufacturer said business would be better in the second half of the fiscal year thanks to expected increases in shipments to China and other Asian markets, although that wouldn몭t offset the poor first half.
SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Yukihiko Shimada said, 몮Sales projections for the second half are somewhat bullish, and may come in short.몯
Japan Display몭s setback is the latest example of the difficulties Japanese manufactures are having staying profitable in a highly volatile market, even with efforts to become more cost-efficient.

Miles Beyond the Biopic: Don Cheadle Riffs on a Jazz Legend
By Steve Chagollan

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Don Cheadle has managed to accomplish something no one has been able to pull off in two decades: serve up a bigscreen tale of jazz great Miles Davis.
"Miles Ahead," in which the versatile actor portrays the legendary trumpeter, marks the directorial debut of Cheadle, who co-wrote the script. The independently financed production, made for $8.5 million, wrapped a monthlong shoot in Cincinnati in mid-August, capping a lengthy gestation period for a project that began eight years ago with Davis' posthumous induction into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.
The picture, which has yet to score a U.S. distributor, is among a number of film endeavors centering on iconic black musicians - all of them divisive figures who were considered ahead of their time, with none of the films so far connecting with a wide audience. Most recently, "Jimi: All Is by My Side," starring Andre Benjamin (aka Outkast's Andre 3000) as Jimi Hendrix, bowed quietly Sept. 26, and has grossed less than $300,000 to date. "Get On Up," the $30 million James Brown biopic, received a similarly chilly reception, despite major studio support (Universal), grossing little more than its budget since its Aug. 1 debut. Alex Gibney's low-earning documentary "Finding Fela!" about Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, opened in limited release in early August.
"Nina," which stars Zoe Saldana as troubled pianist-singer Nina Simone - who like Davis could not be pinned to a specific musical genre - appears to be in a holding pattern, despite being shown to potential distributors at Cannes in May. The movie has been embroiled in controversy ever since it was announced that Saldana, a light-skinned beauty of Dominican descent, would play Simone.
And there will no doubt be legions of naysayers who will object to the way the Davis story is told, given the kind of fanatical following such artists tend to cultivate.
"Miles Davis is a hugely significant figure, perhaps one of the most important musicians and cultural figures of the 20th Century," says Todd Boyd, professor of critical studies at USC who specializes in the study of race and popular culture. "So attempting to reduce someone's life like Miles into a two-hour film is a challenge in and of itself."
Bryce Duffy for Variety Davis' career spanned some 50 years, and the highlights are many, from his pioneering "Birth of the Cool" sessions starting in 1949, to his first quintet with John Coltrane in the '50s, his orchestral collaborations with Gil Evans later in the decade, the second great quintet with Herbie Hancock in the '60s, and his electro-funk Prince of Darkness phase.
Cheadle's take on Davis, co-written with Steven Baigelman, leans toward the more conceptual, juxtaposing two periods in the trumpeter's life. "The central story takes place in two days, before he made his comeback (in 1980)," Cheadle says. The "B story," as he calls it, reflects back to 1956-66, which parallels Davis' relationship with his first wife, dancer Frances Taylor Davis. "She's sort of the one that got away," Cheadle explains, "the love of his life." Saldana was originally identified to play Frances, but the role ultimately went to Emayatzy Corinealdi (Sundance hit "The Middle of Nowhere").
Sets and locations in Cincinnati double for Davis' New York Brownstone, the office of Columbia Records executive George Butler, and for performance spaces in the flashback sequences that could make up as much as 40% of the film.
The filmmakers are adamant that "Miles Ahead" not be considered a biopic, but rather an interpretation of what made the trumpeter tick. "It's like wall-to-wall truth, not wall-to-wall facts," explains Cheadle, who says the script ideas he rejected were too traditional in tone, and too aggressive in scope. "We're much closer to something like historical fiction, where this is a composition of our making, using Miles as our inspiration, our muse, to tell a story from our perspective."
At the time of Davis' Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2006, his nephew, Vince Wilburn Jr., a producer on the movie, was asked if a Miles Davis film was in the works. And, as Cheadle recalls now - adding that he didn't know it then - Wilburn had said, " 'Yes, and Don Cheadle's going to play him.'"
Wilburn, who played a role in coaxing the man he calls "Uncle Miles" out of retirement in 1980, confirms the story. "We just knew (Cheadle) would fit," he says, calling the actor's performance "his interpretation; his spin." Adds Erin Davis, the trumpeter's son and also a producer on the feature: "I can say that the direction of the film is going to be what Miles would have liked."
There are many reasons Miles Davis stopped performing and recording in 1974, including serious health issues, creative burnout, continued hostility from critics who refused to embrace his electronic music, and perhaps just an old-fashioned midlife crisis (Davis was about to turn 50 at the time, corresponding with Cheadle's current age).
"Miles had this incredible facility and ability to move to the next thing and the next thing, and not play it safe and not repeat himself," says Cheadle, whose swaggering self-confidence and wiry intensity appear to make him the ideal candidate for the role. "When that's exhausted, what do you do? So that to me was a very interesting part of his life."
Cheadle says he sought directing counsel from some of the helmers he's worked with, including Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Carl Franklin and George Clooney, who knows what it's like to juggle roles from behind and in front of the camera.
"I knew it on paper; I knew what our schedule was, which was ambitious to say the least," Cheadle says of the 30-day shoot. "But experience is the real kicker when you're on the set. It's like, 'Wow, OK, there's no pause' - and trying to do things that are in some ways diametrically opposed; trying to be immersed in the acting but also have some sort of 10,000-foot perspective."
Bryce Duffy for Variety The filmmakers are cagey about what other real-life figures will be depicted in the movie or how much performance footage will be included - pretty much keeping anything other than the story's broad strokes under wraps. Ewan McGregor reportedly will play a Rolling Stone reporter, loosely based on a real-life person who inadvertently gets Miles out of his isolation, according to Cheadle. That reporter very well could be David Breskin (though Cheadle elaborates by calling the character "an amalgam"), who gained significant access to Davis during and after his seclusion, based on the Jack Chambers biography of Davis, entitled "Milestones."
Cheadle says he neither glossed over nor dwelled on Davis' dissolute lifestyle, including excessive cocaine abuse and certain misogynistic tendencies, which the trumpeter described with blunt candor in his autobiography "Miles." "We're dealing with everything," he says. "But it's not the point of that period."
A warts-and-all treatment of a pop figure can be problematic when negotiating for rights with that talent's estate. Biopics on Charlie Parker ("Bird"), Ray Charles ("Ray") and Johnny Cash ("Walk the Line") managed to navigate through all the speed bumps. But long-in-the-works films on Janis Joplin and Marvin Gaye, to name just two, seem no closer to realization now than when they were first announced several years ago.
Cooperation of estates that control the artist's likeness, access to personal archives and, in the case of the Davis family, music publishing rights, is key. The cost of licensing the music alone can be a deal-breaker, although "Jimi" managed to skirt the issue by avoiding any music Hendrix wrote himself. "Miles Ahead" is benefitting from the full cooperation of the Davis estate, controlled by Wilburn, Davis' kids Erin and Cheryl Davis, and Darryl Porter, general manager of Miles Davis Properties. The estate controls publishing rights to Davis' music, while Sony owns the master recordings for much of the period covered in the movie. "Columbia and Sony have been very generous in giving us things at a price that doesn't break the bank," Cheadle says, "but we absolutely have had to pay for it."
The estate has aggressively marketed all things Miles since his death in 1991, assisting Sony with exhaustive boxed CD/DVD sets, publishing an art book showcasing Davis' paintings, and peddling Miles-themed merchandise and mounting annual treks to SXSW to further fan the flame among younger audiences. Porter says Davis "is best-known for being a musician, although we claim he's a lifestyle."
Many of these Davis collectibles were offered as incentives to those who contributed to crowdfunding service Indiegogo to help raise more than $343,000 in gap financing for the film. According to Indiegogo's head of film, Marc Hoffstatter, the 2,000-plus funders were driven by social media, with Cheadle boasting some 240,000 Twitter followers, and the Miles Davis website claiming almost two million likes on Facebook. Cheadle invested his own money in the production, but wouldn't reveal how much. The rest was covered via independent financing from Bifrost Pictures, with a favorable Ohio tax rebate. IM Global handled foreign pre-sales.
Herbie Hancock's involvement in the film has been described as everything from serving as a consultant to a technical advisor, although he describes his role as non-specific. Whatever original music is being done for the film is from jazz crossover artist Robert Glasper. "The only music I've heard so far is what Robert has done," says Hancock, who was drawn into the project in its very early stages. "It sampled some ideas that Don had discussed with me earlier."
Adds Cheadle: "Robert Glasper is kind of taking point on actually creating the music and playing that music. Herbie is kind of our shepherd and godfather, making sure we don't fall off the beam."
Telling the Miles Davis story has baffled Hollywood for at least 20 years. Former Columbia Records chief Walter Yetnikoff announced a planned biopic in 1993, starring Wesley Snipes. But despite securing rights to Davis' autobiography, and talking with Spike Lee about directing, the Yetnikoff project, tentatively titled "Million Dollar Lips," fell through, and his option lapsed. Producer Marvin Worth ("Lenny," "Malcolm X") picked up the thread from there, but his death in 1998 halted further progress.
After the Davis estate hooked up with Cheadle, it shopped the idea to the studios, but ultimately decided to take the independent route. "I always felt that if we could do it with creative control, where people like Don could see it through in his own vision, we would have a focused direction," Erin Davis says.
Wilburn gets more specific. "Hollywood didn't buy it," he says. "I stopped going to the pitches, because it was too frustrating to try to convince people who Miles Davis is."
For his part, Hancock is confident that Cheadle's take on Davis properly captures the musician's spirit. "It's not a documentary of Miles Davis' life," he says. "It's a story that's got its inspiration from Miles' music -- that kind of in-the-moment creative flow that Miles had. The thing I like about that type of approach is that we don't have to worry about people saying, 'Wait a minute, it didn't happen this way.'"
But Boyd, who has read the script, is skeptical. "It seems as though the period of time that they picked - the late '70s - is probably the least significant era of Miles' music," he says. "If this film actually does make it to the screen, there's the likelihood that we won't see any more Miles Davis biopics any time soon. And so the legacy of Miles Davis is resting thus far on this one film, and I don't think based on what I've seen, this film serves the purpose of properly representing what Miles Davis represented to American music and American culture."
Cheadle is more concerned with making a movie that's entertaining than with giving a history lesson. "I don't think the movie can tarnish the legacy," he says. "To me, Miles' legacy is his music."
For its part, the Davis family seems anything but displeased by what has transpired. "I want people to understand how complex he was," Erin Davis says about his expectations of the film, "and I want them to leave the movie wanting to know more."
Cheadle is well aware of the tremendous risks involved. "I know I'm dancing in a minefield on this one," he says, "but I'd own it."

GameStop몭s Holiday Pitch: More Layaway, Generous Financing; Electronics Retailer to Offer Expanded Layaway Offerings, Including Game Consoles

GameStop Corp. on Wednesday continued its push for holiday shoppers by unveiling expanded layaway offerings, including next-generation videogame consoles and tablets, along with more generous financing terms for holders of its store credit cards.
The latest moves come as the videogame and electronics retailer has been posting strong results buoyed by demand for new consoles from Sony, Microsoft Corp. and Nintendo.
For the holidays, the company is preparing to see high demand for new games for the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One and the Wii U, as well as from customers who are looking to trade in their old smartphones for cash to help buy the new Apple Inc. iPhone 6. GameStop refurbishes and sells used iPhones and other pre-owned electronics as it looks to become a bigger player in an industry that the company expects will grow by 20% to 25% annually over the next five years.
Last month, to prepare for the rush, GameStop said it would hire 25,000 seasonal workers this year, a 47% jump from last year.
In another change from last year, when the Microsoft and Sony consoles debuted, the retailer has made the PlayStation 4 available for layaway during the upcoming holiday season. It had previously made the console available for layaway in April.
The Xbox One, which was available for layaway in February, wasn몭t on the list of products the company announced Wednesday. However, a company representative confirmed that the device will become available for layaway in early November.
Two Samsung Galaxy 4 tablets will be available under the program, too, the company said, as will a variety of headsets and accessories that hadn몭t been available before. The company added that it will make more products available as the season progresses and items become available.
GameStop also said it is also offering a limited-time financing offer for holders of its PowerUP Rewards Pro credit card. Under the incentive, customers will be eligible to pay nothing in interest on purchases of $500 or more for six months, GameStop said.
Retailers have reinvigorated layaway programs in recent years as cost-conscious consumers trim back credit-card spending amid a slow economic recovery. Sears Holdings Corp.몭s Kmart chain recently triggered the beginning of its layaway season, as well.

UPDATE 1-Japan Display cuts forecast as sales of high-end Chinese smartphones disappoint

By Sophie Knight and Reiji Murai
TOKYO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Smartphone and tablet panel maker Japan Display Inc slashed its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday to a 10 billion yen ($93 million) net loss, citing lower-than-expected sales of high-end panels to Chinese handset makers.
Japan Display, which had previously estimated it would post a net profit of 26.8 billion yen, said Chinese smartphone makers had not adopted full high-definition displays as rapidly as it had expected, while delayed shipments to a large customer had depressed sales in the six months to Sept. 31.
Sources told Reuters in August that Apple Inc suppliers including Japan Display had suffered a setback due to a design glitch with the panel for the recently released iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, halting some production assembly operations.
The forecast cut is the latest bad news for Japan Display, whose share price scraped a new all-time low on Wednesday before the announcement. An earlier profit warning and disappointing results both last year and for the first quarter have cast doubts over the viability of its high-end panel business.
Japan Display, the result of a merger between the display units of Sony Corp, Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd, troubled investors by its reliance on a tablet market so sluggish that analysts say even Apple may struggle to turn it around if it announces new iPads as rumoured on Thursday.
A source close to Japan Display said the company's full-year forecast had also taken a hit after orders from a Japanese handset maker had come in lower than expected, while prices for mid-end panels for the Chinese market had sagged.
Japan Display said it would not pay a dividend for the second quarter ended September, which it had not previously set, and also cut its operating profit forecast for the year to March 31 to 6.5 billion yen from a previous forecast of 40 billion yen.
In a separate filing, the Japanese company said it would close its Fukaya plant in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, resulting in an extraordinary loss of around 7 billion yen in the second half of the financial year. It said it would move staff from the plant to other manufacturing facilities.
Japan Display's share price ended flat on Wednesday at 439 yen after hitting a low of 431 yen, a lifetime low and 52.1 percent below the offering price of 900 yen at its initial public offering in March. ($1=107.4100 Japanese yen) (Reporting by Sophie Knight; Editing by Ryan Woo)

Japan Display had initially forecast a net profit of 26.8 billion yen. The company, which supplies displays for Apple Inc's iPhones, also cut its operating profit forecast for the year to March 31 to 6.5 billion yen from a previous forecast of 40 billion yen.

From the makers of Denmark's The Killing and Borgen: a costume drama
Denmark has launched a new television series that it hopes will emulate the global success of its previous hits Borgen and The Killing but, eschewing contemporary murder and political twists, it has moved into an entirely new landscape -- historical drama. With the same actors and producers as the Scandinavian Noir dramas that were watched by millions around the world, Danish state-funded broadcaster DR says '1864' keeps the same recipe of character development and melancholy to get viewers hooked.
Brotherhood brings Pitt, cast together in war film 'Fury'

Digital doctors: China sees tech cure for healthcare woes

HANGZHOU, China, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Liu Chunming almost died after a car crash in July in Taihe, a remote county in China's southeast Jiangxi province, but survived serious abdominal injuries thanks to specialist doctors who led his treatment from 1,000 kms (621 miles) away.
From a central "operations room" in the eastern city of Hangzhou, doctors diagnosed and directed treatment for the 48-year-old using live video feeds and software that shares patient scans and files to aid consultation.
Liu's case - one of a growing number of distance healthcare cases in China - reflects the rise in digital healthcare, or eHealth, to bridge the chasm between China's developed health services in large cities and its grassroots rural care.
And that's a multi-billion dollar opportunity for technology firms.
"I'm not sure what would have happened without the distance diagnosis technology," Liu said in a phone interview from his village of Xiakeng in Taihe. He has since recovered.
To be sure, technology - from electronic patient records to remote healthcare - is already widely used in developed markets such as the United States and Europe, but the sheer size and scale of China make this a huge opportunity for tech firms and a big challenge for doctors, who say China lags far behind.
China's healthcare management sector is growing at close to 40 percent a year and will hit $38 billion in the next five years, according to local consultancy Raisewin International.
Technology is playing a growing role as Beijing overhauls a healthcare management sector blighted by chaotic patient data, underfunded rural health centres, overburdened city hospitals and a nationwide shortage of doctors.
"Technologies like remote health fit China's current situation because we have a large country with a rural-urban gap and medical resources spread unequally," said Yan Jianhua, who oversees the remote healthcare programme at the state-run Hangzhou hospital unit that treated Liu.
Government-supported programmes are looking to leverage specialised software and communication equipment to get the most out of in-demand doctors and specialists at leading hospitals.
The Hangzhou operations room, where doctors work remotely with around 160 hospitals across China, is equipped by global tech brands including Cisco Systems, Dell and Sony Corp.
INVESTMENT DRIVE
China's digital healthcare makeover won't come cheap though. Experts predict a multi-billion dollar bill to bring in IT systems for patient records, develop patient-doctor interaction software and install national networks.
Private investors and big corporations are already pumping money into the sector, with investment in Chinese healthcare IT alone predicted to double to some 34 billion yuan ($5.6 billion) by 2017, according to analytics firm IDC.
"There's a lot of interest because of China's demographics and the helpful trends in the market. Everyone's trying to get in and take as much market share as they can," said Mark Gilbraith, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers China life sciences unit, adding the adoption of healthcare technology was being driven by China's use of smartphones, an ageing population and a boom in chronic diseases as wealth levels rise.
Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings led a $100 million round of funding into healthcare platform Guahao.com on Monday and last month took a stake in popular drug information platform DXY.com. E-commerce group Alibaba invested in healthcare data firm CITIC 21CN Co Ltd in January.
From a standing start just a couple of years ago, these kinds of digital applications have attracted millions of users as doctors, and patients, become increasingly tech savvy.
Doctors now spend close to 13 hours a week online, including interacting with peers and patients, up from 11 hours in 2012, according to a report from Kantar Health and DXY.com. Over 80 percent use mobile phones to go online, more than double the number two years ago.
Other international companies to get in to this market include IBM Corp, Microsoft Corp, BT Group and Siemens AG. Locally, China Mobile , Huawei Technology Co Ltd and ZTE Corp are competing, too.
"There is clear adoption of tele-health and mobile health in remote locations sprouting up across China," said Kendall Ho, an eHealth expert at the University of British Columbia, which is working on a project in southern China.
HEALTHCARE DIVIDE
China's healthcare system struggles with a dearth of doctors and a significant gap between the level of quality in urban and rural hospitals. Patients often travel hundreds of miles to see a specialist in one of the big city centres.
Low pay and an often volatile relationship between overworked doctors and frustrated patients has seen the number of medical professionals fall in the last decade, according to a Deutsche Bank report, leaving many of China's almost 25,000 hospitals short of doctors.
A lack of centralized information systems for patient data, uneven distribution of resources and issues over patient registration, booking appointments and payment have all created a space for technology, said Xu Ruixue, director of public affairs solutions at ZTE, a Chinese telecoms equipment maker. Beijing plans to establish electronic health records to cover three-quarters of the population by next year.
"Information technology has a key role to play in resolving these challenges," said Xu, adding ZTE is expanding its work in hospital information systems and remote healthcare.
Other firms are pushing forward trials including healthcare 'clouds' to store and share information, online hospitals for self-diagnosis, tele-health and mobile health apps.
This will all take time, and money.
An IT overhaul to Britain's National Health Service cost tens of billions of dollars and came under fire for inefficiencies. China's near 1.4 billion population dwarfs the UK's 64 million.
But Beijing is on-board and sees technology as a potential quick-fix for its healthcare woes, Jian told Reuters at the Zhejiang hospital's distance telemedicine centre.
"Our remote diagnosis programme is already part of the country's healthcare reform drive," he said. "China's health ministry and the state is a big advocate and support."

PREVIEW-Netflix movie push aims to freshen streaming content

LOS ANGELES, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc is on a mission to start closing the yawning gap between the theatrical debut of movies and their availability for online streaming, forcing Hollywood to rethink where to release new films.
With a sequel to martial-arts drama "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and four Adam Sandler movies, Netflix will have brand-new content for subscribers around the world. That instant access is much quicker than the typical 7-to-18 months Netflix must wait to stream new releases from Hollywood studios.
Netflix has said it believes new and exclusive movies will help it build on its base of 50 million global customers. The company will release its latest subscriber numbers in its quarterly report on Wednesday, when it is expected to face questions about the original movie strategy.
Sandler's films will go straight to Netflix in the nearly 50 countries where the company operates. The international rights are key because many movie rights are tied up by other providers in overseas territories.
Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible estimates Netflix will spend up to $40 million on production of each Sandler film. That cost would be similar to what Netflix pays to stream a single film from a Hollywood producer such as DreamWorks Animation months later, he said.
"The perk here is you don't have to wait nine months," said Wible. "You have something you have exclusive access to across the globe."
If it can convince more stars and directors to accept straight-to-streaming deals, Netflix could shake up movies as it did television. In the case of its original series like "House of Cards" and "Orange is the New Black," it has fueled binge viewing by releasing all episodes at once. Netflix also won the first major Emmy awards for a series delivered online.
With more original movie deals in the works for Netflix, Hollywood directors told Reuters they are weighing the pros and cons.
David Ayer, director of the coming World War II drama "Fury" starring Brad Pitt, said he "absolutely" could be lured by an online distributor for a future project.
"The screens we watch on are becoming handheld (and) portable," he said. "It's the future of the business."
Ayer said he was hopeful that an online platform would grant him the same artistic freedom that Sony Pictures did with "Fury." "That's what studios need to do in order to maintain access to the labor of love of a filmmaker," he said.
Others in Hollywood may resist going to Netflix first.
Ned Benson, a first-time writer and director, took an unconventional approach for his release of "The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby," creating three separate films called "Him," "Her" and "Them."
While it seemed logical to release the three installments via video on demand for binge viewing at home, Benson wanted the films shown in theaters first.
"I really still believe in the theatrical model and the movie-going experience, even though we live in this day and age where you can stream and do things online via Netflix or VOD," Benson said. "I feel like we still have that option later."
The plan to release "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend" on Netflix in all of its markets in August on the same day the movie appears in select IMAX theaters has also raised the hackles of some theater owners. Chains AMC Entertainment, Regal Entertainment Group and Cinemark Holdings Inc are refusing to show the film.
It remains to be seen whether such opposition will deter other filmmakers from playing ball with Netflix in the future. (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Additional reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; editing by Gunna Dickson)

Life and Style
From Ballet to Broadway and Beyond; In 1944, 몬On the Town몭 made stars of the show몭s backstage talent.

When 몮On the Town몯 had its Broadway premiere in 1944, during the final months of World War II, it was at once retro and radical, quickly establishing itself as a milestone of American musical theater (and the basis for one of the all-time great Hollywood musical films five years later). The challenge for director John Rando, who is staging a revival of the musical that opens at New York몭s Lyric Theatre on Oct. 16, will be in finding what is current and what is timeless in a show so specific to a unique period in our collective history.
몮On the Town몯 grew out of an idea by choreographer Jerome Robbins. At the time, ballet was generally regarded as highbrow, invariably concerned with gods and goddesses or with dying swans. Robbins몭s idea (inspired by a 1934 painting by Paul Cadmus) was to make ballet vital and topical by depicting three carousing sailors on shore leave in New York, boisterously competing with one another for the attention of girls in a saloon. That notion initially took shape as the ballet 몮Fancy Free몯 (1944) the first of many collaborations between Robbins and composer Leonard Bernstein, who had made his conducting debut with the New York Philharmonic in November 1943.
Following its April opening at the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York, 몮Fancy Free몯 was such a hit as a ballet that Robbins and Bernstein were approached to develop the idea into a full-scale Broadway show. Now the problem was how to combine Robbins몭s classically informed dance numbers with musical-comedy theatrics, and Bernstein knew the perfect kids to write the book and lyrics: his former roommate Adolph Green and Green몭s writing-and-performing partner Betty Comden, whose experience up to then consisted mainly of crafting original material for their nightclub act, The Revuers. Robbins was the only one of the four with any real Broadway experience멪though as a dancer, not a dancemaker.
At first, Comden and Green couldn몭t believe they were being asked to write a show about servicemen on leave. That was already a much-overused trope of Hollywood movies such as 몮Born to Dance몯 (1936) and 몮Seven Days Leave몯 (1942). But they quickly got the point: 몮On the Town몯 would draw its energy from the deliberately incongruous juxtaposition of the highbrow and the lowbrow. With Robbins몭s ballet sequences and the comedy멪both visual and verbal멪of Comden and Green, the show was supposed to be a cross between George Balanchine and the Three Stooges.
몮On the Town몯 was a sizable hit on Broadway, running for 462 performances. And it made stars of its backstage talent (Comden and Green were also on stage in prominent roles), doing the most to accelerate Bernstein몭s rise as a formidable force in American music. As his centennial approaches, it is clear that neither Bernstein몭s original classical music nor his purely instrumental jazz compositions are as overwhelmingly successful as his theater music. Bernstein, especially in his dance numbers, combined Prokofiev with Ellington멪long, elegiac, sweeping, balletic lines that make knowing use of blue notes, saxophone solos and jazzy phrasing.
MGM immediately snapped up the rights to 몮On the Town몯 and put Comden and Green under long-term contract. The resulting movie was a sensation and remains a classic to this day멪marking Gene Kelly몭s directorial debut and one of Frank Sinatra몭s most memorable movie roles. Yet the 1949 film is less of a masterpiece than it might have been had producer Arthur Freed not dropped most of Bernstein몭s songs. Kelly몭s primary motivation as one of the film몭s stars was to dance to Bernstein몭s superlative ballet music; as a first-time director, he apparently didn몭t feel he had the clout to make the case for the rest of the original score. Neither did Comden and Green멪who were importuned to write substitute songs with MGM stalwart Roger Edens멪and, remarkably, neither did Sinatra. Betty Comden later told me, in 1994, 몮Frank said that the only reason he agreed to do the movie was so that he could sing 몬Lonely Town,몭몯 a number that never made it to the film. (Some of the new Comden-Green-Edens songs are good, although when I told Comden that her 1949 song 몮Prehistoric Man몯 was even better than 몮Carried Away,몯 the 1944 song it replaced, she stood up dramatically, pointed toward the doorway, and demanded that I leave her apartment immediately. I suspected that she was kidding, at least to a degree, primarily because we were actually in Adolph Green몭s apartment at the time.)
Thus the movie몭s best moments are Kelly몭s effervescent dances and the street-wise comedy that Comden and Green wrote for a game cast that also includes the brilliant dancers Vera Ellen and Ann Miller. But MGM missed out on such gemlike Bernstein ballads as 몮Lucky to Be Me몯 and, especially, 몮Some Other Time.몯 Many years later, Tony Bennett and Bill Evans would reveal to us the luminescent beauty of those two numbers, and Sinatra eventually recorded a definitive reading of 몮Lonely Town.몯 These are some of the most beautiful songs ever written for the American theater.
More than beautiful, these tunes are enduring. In addition to being regularly listed as one of the classic Broadway shows, 몮On the Town몯 is one of 16 whose books and lyrics are collected in the Library of America몭s new 몮American Musicals몯 volumes. (Further, Sony has just reissued a 1963 London cast album featuring a young Elliott Gould as Chip.)
The MGM version cannot be considered a definitive document of 몮On the Town,몯 and the 1971 and 1998 Broadway revivals of the show were both short-lived. It is hard to imagine that any subsequent team could recapture the brash energy that Robbins, Bernstein, Comden and Green brought to their own material in 1944멪an exact parallel to that of the three sailors who sought nothing less than to condense a lifetime몭s worth of living, loving and laughing into a single day. 몮On The Town몯 is, more than anything, a product of its time, and now it is up to Mr. Rando to bring out the majesty of its music and dancing and to show contemporary theatergoers the work몭s transcendent magic.
Mr. Friedwald writes the weekly Jazz Scene column for the Journal.

The Columbus Effect in Business; Pioneering is glorious, but later entrants are often the ones who see the true potential of discoveries.

Christopher Columbus will be feted in many places on Monday as an intrepid explorer, reviled in others as the spearhead of European colonization. But the Genoese ship captain who in 1492 sailed west to parts unknown might be best considered today for what he can tell us about ourselves. The man who successfully pioneered direct cross-Atlantic navigation also died dispossessed and embittered. In this respect Columbus represents a type, not an exception: failing pioneers.
Many scholars believe that pioneers are highly successful, have a high market share, and are long-term leaders of the markets they pioneer. Yet historical analysis shows that pioneers mostly fail, have a lower market share and rarely lead their industries. Long-term market leaders seldom are pioneers. Rather, they are ones who appreciate the discoveries of pioneers, envision the mass market and exploit it profitably.
But the myth lives on. Scholars talk of 몮first-mover advantage몯 as though it were a law. Students come out of business school obsessed with being 몮first to enter,몯 as though it were a pre-eminent strategy. Analysts admonish entrepreneurs to 몮rush to market.몯 The mantra of consultants: 몮Better to be first than to be better.몯
Really? Today몭s market leaders in many categories didn몭t pioneer those categories. Microsoft didn몭t pioneer personal-computer operating systems (QDOS came before) or word processing (WordStar and others came before). Amazon didn몭t pioneer online books stores (Books.com came before). Apple didn몭t pioneer mobile music, the smartphone, the tablet (Sony, BlackBerry and others came before). Google didn몭t pioneer Internet search (AltaVista, among others, came before). And Facebook didn몭t pioneer online social networks (Myspace came before).
Why do pioneers tend to fail in the long run? For the same reason that Christopher Columbus didn몭t flourish despite his initial success: Pioneers too often cling to their initial intuition, just as Columbus clung for too long to the notion he had reached India. Pioneers focus on the small initial market, failing to envision the vast mass market that they just opened up. Pioneers stick with the initial product even when the market demands relentless innovation. All the while, a surge of later entrants learns from mistakes of pioneers, envisions opportunities and rides on the explosion of new superior technologies.
For example, BlackBerry popularized smart phones with their nifty physical keyboard. But the company ultimately declined because it clung too long to a physical keyboard while consumers were rapidly adopting touch-screen smartphones. Even Thomas Edison fought a bitter losing battle to protect direct current against the then new technology of alternating current멪which ultimately became the standard.
Yet pioneering is a glorious term. So much so that those who capitalize on the breakthroughs of others often promote themselves as pioneers, basking in their self-anointed glory and feeding the myth of pioneering advantage. If these later entrants forget their humble roots, though, such self-promotion may lead to self-deception. In today몭s climate, millions of entrepreneurs the world over are crafting the innovations that can topple overconfident market leaders.
Mr. Tellis, a professor and director of the Center for Global Innovation at the University of Southern California몭s Marshall School of Business, is the author of 몮Unrelenting Innovation: How to Create a Culture for Market Dominance몯 (Jossey-Bass, 2013).

21st Century Fox Inc. and private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC have formed a programming partnership that will combine three television production companies into one with the hopes of creating a global entertainment giant.
Under the terms of the joint venture, 21st Century Fox몭s Shine Group and Apollo몭s Endemol and Core Media will be merged. All three companies are primarily known for unscripted content. Core is a producer of Fox몭s 몮American Idol.몯 Shine makes 몮The Biggest Loser몯 for NBC. Endemol몭s shows include 몮Big Brother,몯 which airs on CBS.
몮The combination of these assets will create a leading global format business with a deep and diverse portfolio of products, enhanced distribution capabilities and world-class creative talent,몯 said 21st Century Fox President Chase Carey.
The terms of transaction weren몭t disclosed but the entity has been valued at more than $2 billion, people familiar with the companies said.
The deal, which had been in the works since spring, continues a trend of consolidation among unscripted production companies. U.K. broadcaster ITV PLC has been very active, acquiring an 80% stake of Leftfield Entertainment, whose shows include 몮Pawn Stars, and a 61.5% piece of 몮Duck Dynasty몯 producer Gurney Productions.
Last month, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. bought a 55% stake One Three Media, a joint-venture between 몮Survivor몯 producer Mark Burnett and Hearst Corp.
More sales may be in the works. Tinopolis PLC, which has been a buyer is now said to be on the block. Earlier this year, Tinopolis acquired Magical Elves, which makes 몮Top Chef몯 for Bravo. It also owns A. Smith & Co. Productions, producer of Fox몭s 몮Hell몭s Kitchen.몯
Another motivating for 21st Century Fox may have been to keep pace with Time Warner Inc.몭s Warner Bros. and Sony Corp. both of which have been aggressive in expanding abroad through acquisitions of production companies.
Fox and Endemol will each own 50% of the venture, which has more than 600 scripted and nonscripted formats and have operations in more than 30 markets. Sophie Turner Laing, a former managing director of content at British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC, which Fox has a large ownership stake in, has been named chief executive of the as-yet-unnamed company.
As a result of the deal, several top executives from the individual companies will be leaving, including Shine Non-Executive Chairman Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of 21st Century Fox Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch. Until last year, 21st Century Fox was part of the same company as News Corp, the owner of The Wall Street Journal.
몮As Shine enters this new chapter with new partners, it is the right time for me to take the final step back from the company I love,몯 Ms. Murdoch said in a written statement. Shine was founded by Ms. Murdoch in 2001 and sold in 2011 for $675 million.

Film Review: 'Fury'

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Some feats are unforgettable: We remember the Alamo, along with the 300 Spartans who died at Thermopylae. But a five-man American tank crew (actually, four men and a baby, to be more accurate) overwhelmed by a platoon of German soldiers? Not only did the standoff depicted in "Fury" never happen, but it will likely be long gone from moviegoers' memories six months from now, after Sony's marketing blows over and people go back to watching "Inglourious Basterds" - the other, better pulp World War II movie featuring Brad Pitt as a heavily scarred, slow-drawling Nazi hunter. With a disappointing domestic reception ahead, David Ayer's first big-studio foray as director will rely on a strong showing overseas, where its fantasy of American exceptionalism will seem all the more egregious.
Until now, writer-director Ayer has largely focused his attention on gritty LAPD dramas, Tasering the genre back to life with such tell-it-like-it-is pics as "Training Day" and "End of Watch." Set during the waning days of World War II, as the Allies advance on Berlin and the Nazis put up vicious resistance on their home turf, "Fury" shifts the director's focus to military history. As such, the project marks a massive step forward in both ambition and scale for Ayer, but also brings disappointment. Though colorfully embellished with authentic detail and logistically complex to bring to the screen, Ayer's script is bland at the most basic story level, undermined by cardboard characterizations and a stirring yet transparently silly climactic showdown.
Even so, the film benefits from the scribe's usual research-based approach to capturing the tight, honor-bound dynamic of serving on the front lines, enriched by his ear for precise (and period-appropriate) technical patter. The pressure-cooker atmosphere is enhanced by the fact that Pitt's character, Sgt. Don Collier (a diluted version of his Lt. Aldo Raine from "Basterds"), and his men are sardined into a Sherman tank in which they've been serving side by side since North Africa. They all have nicknames (Collier's is "Wardaddy"), as does the tank itself: "FURY," menacingly painted in all caps on its 76mm cannon barrel.
It's a marvel of military service how men who might despise one another in civilian life can become like brothers in the field, and here, we get a sense of both the off-color squabbling and the deep-rooted camaraderie among these virtual siblings. Wardaddy's team includes the Scripture-quoting "Bible" (Shia LaBeouf), Latino driver "Gordo" (Michael Pena, affecting an early-century Mexican accent) and barely evolved swamp-rat mechanic "Coon-Ass" (Jon Bernthal). Ayer introduces the team from within the tight confines of their tank, a space that doesn't yield many good angles, but allows for some nifty lighting tricks. D.p. Roman Vasyanov's favorite is clearly to frame just the actors' eyes through the narrow slits of the tank's armor.
These guys look and sound like they've been to hell and back (even pretty-boy LaBeouf, who appears with his face scruffy and teeth blacked out for the role). But don't let the constant stream of personal, off-color insults fool you. Their views may differ, but they can agree on one thing: "Best job I ever had!" they exclaim, and Ayer clearly believes it. That's not necessarily the case for baby-faced newcomer Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), a clean-shaven, wet-behind-the-ears Army typist assigned to join them at the outset - more for reasons of dramatic convenience than practical necessity.
Norman serves as the audience's proxy, allowing Ayer to show us the ropes as the kid is forced into a situation more intense than he's ready to handle: Norman retches after discovering the scalp of a German soldier while scrubbing the blood from his seat in the tank. As war-movie cliches go, the onscreen spew is off-putting yet effective (Tom Hanks did it when he landed on Normandy Beach in "Saving Private Ryan"), the tough-guy equivalent of watching a neophyte take his first smoke onscreen. The poster boy for S.L.A. Marshall's infamous statistic, estimated in his book "Men Against Fire," that 75% of American troops in World War II never pulled the trigger for the purpose of killing, Norman has serious reservations about handling the machine gun he's assigned. But he grows up fast as tough-love Wardaddy treats the kid like his own "war son."
It's either that or risk letting the incompetent new team member get everyone in the crew killed, which is just the over-simplistic dynamic Ayer exploits for the remainder of the film. There's even a poignant if somewhat protracted interlude featuring "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days" star Anamaria Marinca and younger beauty Alicia von Rittberg ("Barbara"), in which Pitt's character enables the incredulous Norman to lose his virginity: "She's a good, clean girl. If you don't take her in that bedroom, I will."
It was cigar-chomping World War II vet Samuel Fuller who practiced the philosophy that the first shot and last shot of each of his films was the most important. The same could be true of "Fury," which opens and closes with corpse-strewn battlefields, which bookend the film with haunting evidence of the aftermath of war. Generally speaking, "Fury" looks less like recent war movies - with their modern, handheld camerawork and overall emphasis on immersion - than the more classically framed studio pics of an earlier era, where careful attention has been paid to meticulous compositions. The same goes for Steven Price's score, which offers variations on a single three-note motif, poignant when appropriate, but also easily expandable into a full-blown military theme as needed.
Though it's the action scenes that thrill, Ayer makes a point of balancing them with the quiet stretches between skirmishes, acknowledging that boredom - punctuated by a certain giddy tension - characterized much of the time soldiers spent at war. One could seldom anticipate when or where the enemy might strike, but when they did, the transformation from safety to survival mode was instant and entire. That makes for several heart-clutching sequences, including one that narrows Wardaddy's tank column down to just one as they face off against a superior German Tiger tank, using the Fury's speed and agility to defeat their armor-piercing rival. (The production shot with actual Sherman and Tiger tanks from World War II, along with a reconstructed interior whose removable walls did little to diminish the claustrophobia of the tight space.)
In another standoff, the tank column advances on a treeline at dusk. The scene looks like something out of "Star Wars" as the opposing sides exchange what looks like green and red laser fire, though the appearance and sound are both true to Ayer's research: The glowing bullet trails are tracers, which allowed gunners to see where they were shooting - or not, in the case of the trigger-shy Norman.
As in "End of Watch" (in which one character miraculously recovers from a near-fatal shooting), Ayer allows himself to play God here, deciding the fates of his characters for emotional and dramatic impact, even if none should logically survive the assault. Would a team of five men with a half-disabled tank really dig in their heels and fight a platoon of Germans nearly 300 strong? This choice is the most "Hollywood" element in a film that is constantly shifting between disturbing, realistic details (a burning man who shoots himself to escape the pain, or the German "cowards" hanged by the SS from street poles) and the stilted, sometimes even hammy liberties needed to make its point.
Ayer's seemingly contradictory approach can be heard in nearly every line: On one hand, he goes out of his way to capture authentic-sounding slang, encouraging the actors to use accents that aren't always intelligible amid the hyper-attuned (and occasionally deafening) sound mix. On the other, there can be no mistake that this is dialogue, not natural speech, for they express themselves in terse, trailer-quotable soundbites that tend to remind us that we're dealing with a collection of stereotypes, of which Bernthal's redneck is the least convincing, though none ever seems more than skin-deep. If their sacrifice is meant to be memorable, we must first believe them to be men: Ironically, it's the baby of the group, Norman, who emerges "Fury's" most full-fledged character.

The biggest U.S. cable-TV channels are experiencing a troubling trend: Their reach into American households is shrinking.
Over the past four years, the top 40 most widely distributed channels in 2010멪household names like CNN, ESPN and USA멪have lost an average of 3.2 million subscribers, or more than 3% of their distribution, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from measurement firm Nielsen.
Some in the industry point to consumers who are 몮cutting the cord,몯 ditching their cable and satellite-TV connections in favor of more affordable online video options like Netflix and Hulu. But the numbers don몭t add up. Last year the pay-TV industry lost 166,000 subscribers, according to research firm MoffettNathanson LLC. While that was the first annual decline on record, it isn몭t enough to account for the subscriber declines of the biggest cable channels.
Indeed, the data and interviews with a range of cable-TV industry executives suggest that something else is going on: Many consumers aren몭t so much cutting the cord as shaving it.
A growing share of pay-TV customers are signing up for smaller, cheaper bundles of channels that cost anywhere from $10 to $50 a month and don몭t include popular channels like TNT, USA, ESPN, CNN, Fox News, Disney Channel and Discovery Channel, the industry executives say.
몮What we are seeing is some cord cutting and some cord shaving,몯 said Stephen Hasker, global president of Nielsen. 몮Consumer time and attention is shifting.몯
Basic plans that include little more than local broadcast stations now make up some 12% of pay-TV subscriptions, up from 8% to 10% a few years ago, according to estimates by some industry executives. Some consumers are also turning to cheaper, sports-free and family-oriented packages, executives say.
몮We think cord-shaving is a reality going forward,몯 says AT&T Inc.몭s Chief Strategy Officer John Stankey.
The shift of consumers to lower-priced plans is a worrying sign for media companies, striking at the heart of how they make money. TV channels are paid by cable and satellite-TV providers on a per-subscriber basis. Over time, declines in subscribers could dent these companies몭 growth. Pay-TV providers face significant risks, too. If more people downgrade to skinny tiers, it could pressure revenue, analysts say.
Some media executives say losing a few million subscribers to their channels doesn몭t immediately raise alarms. They point out that they have been able to raise the fees they charge pay-TV operators for each subscriber more than enough to offset the declines. Media companies are also optimistic about selling their channels to new Web-based TV services from companies like Sony Corp.
But others are doing some soul searching over how and why this happened. Some executives say media companies have been so eager to make content available to streaming-video companies like Netflix Inc.멪which pays a lot of money for those rights멪that they have actually undermined the pay-TV ecosystem, encouraging consumers to think they can find good programming for cheap online.
몮We몭re at a tipping point of consumers thinking Internet first and TV second,몯 says Bryan Rader, CEO of Bandwidth Consulting LLC, a firm that advises investors about pay-TV marketing trends.
The precise number of people moving to skinnier bundles of channels is murky, since cable-TV providers closely guard that data. Media companies, meanwhile, don몭t disclose the distribution of their TV channels, and some of them contest Nielsen몭s estimates, arguing that changes in the media measurement specialist몭s methodology are to blame.
But data points are piling up to show 몮cord shaving몯 is for real. At least two pay-TV providers say about 10% of gross TV subscriber additions are customers who are taking a slimmed-down bundle멪in contrast to the bigger ones with hundreds of channels that can cost upward of $100 a month.
Most of the biggest channels have lost between three million and five million subscribers since 2010. The two most expensive channels, which feature marquee sports events멪Walt Disney Co.몭s ESPN and Time Warner Inc.몭s TNT멪have been the hardest hit, with subscriber drops of nearly 5%. ESPN this year is expected to receive average monthly fees of $6.04 per subscriber, while TNT will receive $1.44, according to SNL Kagan.
ESPN, touting its 몮35-year history of innovation,몯 responded that 몮the demand for live sports will only continue to grow.몯
There are some limits on how far cord-shaving can go. Big channels like ESPN stipulate in their contracts with distributors that they need to be in the most widely distributed tiers or reach a high percentage of the customer base. That means if too many people start subscribing to cheaper tiers멪ISI Group LLC analyst Vijay Jayant says the threshold is between 10% to 20% of the total base멪providers may have to start bringing the big channels into those bundles and they won몭t be as skinny.
Skinny TV packages have technically been available for years, but operators barely marketed them. A 1992 law stipulated that cable-TV providers must offer 몮basic몯 tiers, consisting of a handful of local broadcast stations and public programming. A mid-2000s push by regulators led to family-oriented tiers, but pay-TV providers didn몭t market those packages broadly either.
Operators몭 thinking has changed. Attracting cost-conscious consumers and the growing pool of people who have never had a cable subscription and mainly consume online video멪so called 몮cord nevers몯멪is now part of their growth strategy. The hope is that they can hook those consumers into pay-TV with the skinny plans and encourage them over time to upgrade to more expensive bundles.
Comcast Corp. last year began marketing a basic tier paired with high-speed Internet and HBO for a promotional price of roughly $50 a month, although it can vary by market. AT&T recently launched a similar offer that also comes with a year몭s free subscription to Amazon.com Inc.몭s Prime streaming video and shipping service. Meanwhile Verizon FiOS and DirecTV have put more marketing muscle behind slimmed-down TV bundles.
Some TV executives say that their internal numbers show shallower declines in their channels몭 reach than Nielsen몭s data does. A big issue, they say, stems from Nielsen몭s decision last year to include broadband-only homes in the panel of consumers it samples to gather industry data. Nielsen warned the change could affect each channel몭s household reach estimate by about 1.2%.
But the drop-off in major channels몭 reach has been going on since 2010멪long before the Nielsen readjustment. Most network executives said that even if their internal numbers didn몭t match Nielsen몭s exactly, the direction was the same멪a steady subscriber decline that is expected to continue.
Nielsen says the subscriber declines are a real phenomenon.
Cord-shaving may be the biggest near-term threat. But the industry몭s bigger long-term risk is that consumers will get so fed up with rising cable prices that more will cut the cord entirely.
Craig Moffett, MoffettNathanson analyst, said 몮investors have gotten complacent and started to believe that cord cutting isn몭t a real risk멞precisely at the time that the forces of cord cutting are starting to gather more momentum.몯

Larger Apple iPad to Be Delayed; Apple Suppliers Concentrating on Meeting Demand for New iPhones

Apple Inc. suppliers have pushed back plans to mass produce a larger-screen tablet to early next year, people familiar with the matter said, as they struggle to make enough new iPhones to meet strong demand.
Suppliers of the Cupertino, Calif., company had originally planned to produce the larger iPad in mass volume beginning in December, the people said.
몮The top priority for the supply chain is to meet the overwhelming demand for the larger screen iPhones. The output of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus remains unsatisfactory,몯 said a person at a supplier. 몮It would be challenging for display makers to split resources and spend a few months to ramp up production for a new larger screen iPad now.몯
Foxconn Technology Co., a major assembler of Apple몭s iPhones and iPads, is also facing the challenge of hiring enough factory workers to assemble the two new iPhones at its largest production site in Zhengzhou, in northern China. At the plant, more than 200,000 workers are dedicated to just making the new iPhones and key components such as metal casings. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is the world몭s largest contract manufacturer by revenue and has more than 1 million workers in China assembling electronics for companies including Apple, Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
몮Everyone is busy with the new iPhones, Foxconn몭s bread and butter. Chairman [Terry Gou] has also gone to the Zhengzhou site to monitor the production closely,몯 said an official at Foxconn.
Apple said it sold more than 10 million of its new iPhones in its first weekend of availability. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus went on sale in 10 countries on Sept. 19. Apple has expanded to other countries in recent weeks and is expected to start sales of the new handsets in China on Oct. 17. The company is expected to give an update on iPhone sales when it reports results for the quarter ended September, on Oct. 20.
Suppliers in Asia say Apple몭s larger tablet will likely have a 12.9-inch liquid-crystal-display screen with resolution that is similar to the current 9.7-inch iPad Air unveiled in October last year.
Apple said on Wednesday it was hosting a media event on Oct. 16. While the media invite didn몭t say what will be discussed, it is expected that Apple will unveil new iPads and iMacs. It remains unclear if the company will unveil plans for the larger iPad at the event and Apple declined to comment.
Apple몭s plans for a larger iPad come as the company몭s tablet business is showing signs of slowing. Unit sales of iPads have fallen for two straight quarters, while revenue from tablets has fallen on a year-to-year basis for four of the past five quarters.
It would be the first time Apple unveils a bigger screen iPad, following its move to launch bigger-screen iPhones last month to counter competition from rivals like Samsung Electronics Co. which popularized the big-screen mobile devices. As early as last year, Apple was testing larger screens for its smartphones and tablets.
Apple introduced a smaller iPad멪the 7.9-inch iPad Mini멪in late 2012 as it tried to offer different sizes to compete in the tablet market.
Data from research firm IDC shows Apple몭s share of the global tablet market has slipped to 26.9% in the second quarter from 33% a year earlier. Samsung몭s share of the tablet market also fell to 17.2% from 18.8% as both companies have been facing rising competition from other Chinese vendors including Lenovo Group Ltd.
Apple has continued to expand its customer base with new products and refinements of current ones.
Suppliers are also preparing for mass production of a 12-inch MacBook Air in December, featuring a higher resolution display, people familiar with the matter said. The current MacBook Air comes in two different sizes: 11-inch and 13-inch models.
Amid a technological sea change from desktop computers to mobile devices, Apple aims to position the iPad as the computing product for a new generation of workers. In July, Apple struck a partnership with International Business Machines Corp. to develop applications targeted at different industries. Under the partnership, IBM also plans to sell iPhones and iPads to its corporate clients.
몮If Apple were to launch a larger iPad, it would need to make better use of the screen real estate. Introducing better multitasking capabilities would certainly drive interest,몯 said Tim Coulling, analyst at Canalys.

Foxconn Workers Walk Off Job at Chinese Plant; About 1,000 Employees Went on Strike for Several Hours This Week

About 1,000 workers at a Foxconn Technology Co. plant in southwest China assembling printers and computers for companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. went on strike for several hours this week demanding higher pay.
The Taiwan-based company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., said the workers walked off the job for four hours Wednesday at its production site in Chongqing. About 20 workers went on strike Thursday morning, but further details on that stoppage weren몭t available.
Foxconn is working with its labor union and workers to resolve the dispute, the company said Thursday in a statement. The company said the strikes didn몭t disrupt production.
Management 몮continuously increased production volumes, and even required individual workers to take on tasks that used to require two workers to handle. The increase in workload wasn몭t compensated,몯 said one worker who declined to be named. He said he participated in the strike.
몮Some workers are not happy because the company [Foxconn] has reduced overtime hours, a key component of their salaries,몯 after H-P cut orders, said a Foxconn official who declined to be named. Workers also demanded the resignation of the factory manager, he said. Also, the company had tried to lay off some workers without paying severance, the official added.
Foxconn filed a complaint with the local police, he said. The reason for the complaint wasn몭t clear.
On the Weibo social-media service, users distributed images that appeared show hundreds of workers gathered outside the Chongqing facility Wednesday, waving protest banners as police officers looked on. The police presence at the factory continued Thursday, according to the worker.
A Chongqing police spokeswoman, however, said she wasn몭t aware of the strike.
Foxconn employs about 30,000 workers at its Chongqing site. The company has more than one million workers in China and is a major supplier to Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp.
The strike came after H-P said earlier this month it planned to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations as it faces intensifying competition from China몭s Lenovo Group Ltd.
몮H-P continuously works to optimize its supply chain in order to maximize production and meet continued customer demand,몯 H-P said in a statement. 몮At times this results in the movement of product lines between supplier factories. When these decisions are made, we work closely with the supplier so they can plan accordingly to minimize the impact to the workers.몯

Amazon in Talks to Join Digital Locker for Movies; E-Commerce Giant Might Come on Board With Studios몭 Cloud-Access System

Amazon.com Inc. is in talks with at least three studios to join the Ultraviolet digital-movie 몮locker몯 consortium, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. Such a deal could jump-start Hollywood몭s effort to expand the $2 billion-plus online movie-sales business and make Amazon a bigger threat to market leader Apple Inc.
Ultraviolet allows people who buy movies from any participating digital retailer, or who redeem a code from a Blu-ray disc, to access an entire library from most Internet-connected devices.
Currently, people who purchase a digital movie from Amazon can watch it only via an Amazon app, while movies they buy from Apple몭s iTunes Store are listed separately in that app.
Backers of Ultraviolet have claimed digital movies will be more appealing to consumers when they have a single online collection, or locker, much like a shelf of DVDs bought from different stores.
Amazon, which is No. 2 behind Apple in digital movie sales and rentals, is in talks with Time Warner Inc.몭s Warner Bros., Sony Corp.몭s Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures to implement Ultraviolet, the knowledgeable people said.
The total market for digital movie sales and rentals in the U.S. is projected to grow 25% to $2.3 billion this year, according to research firm IHS. Helping drive that growth, studios have begun selling most movies for several weeks online before they become available on DVD.
Ultraviolet is backed by every Hollywood studio except Walt Disney Co. The online movie services participating so far are all relatively small players, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.몭s Vudu, Target Corp.몭s Target Ticket and CinemaNow, formerly owned by Best Buy Co.
Notable holdouts have included Apple, Microsoft Corp. and멪until now멪Amazon.
Ultraviolet is viewed by the studios, in part, as a way to prevent Apple from gaining too much power over the sale of movies online, by banding together smaller competitors. Apple몭s market share in online movie sales and rentals last year was 58%, said IHS, down from 75% in 2008.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
Ultraviolet has grown more slowly than its backers had hoped when it launched four year ago, due to the paucity of big retail participants, as well as early technical snafus. To date, the service has amassed close to 20 million registered accounts, each with about five movies, according to a spokeswoman.
Amazon몭s participation could boost those numbers. With a market share of 15%, it is bigger than all of the digital retailers currently participating in Ultraviolet combined, according to IHS.
In addition to its strong position in digital movie downloads, Amazon is among the top three sellers of DVDs and Blu-ray discs for Hollywood studios, behind Wal-Mart and close to Target, according to studio executives. If it joins Ultraviolet, Amazon could enable anyone who buys a movie disc from it to automatically get a digital copy at the same time, without having to redeem a code. The retailer already does something similar for music, giving customers free online versions of albums they have bought on CD.
Blu-rays from most studios come with a code that allows people to get an Ultraviolet digital copy of the movie if they enter it online.
Talks with the three studios have been ongoing for several months, a knowledgeable person said. Technical questions involving how Amazon몭s digital locker would connect to other participating retailers have been a sticking point. Amazon wants to have several Hollywood studios signed up before launching with Ultraviolet, the person said.
Several other prominent digital movie retailers have kept their distance from Ultraviolet. Most notable is Comcast Corp., which started selling movies to its cable customers late last year and has already become a strong competitor, according to studio executives. Despite owning Universal Pictures, one of the studios that back Ultraviolet, the cable company keeps movies it sells within its own silo of set-top boxes and apps.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Sony Pictures Animation's forecast is looking bright, as it and family entertainment outlet DHX Media have inked a deal to adapt the film franchise "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" into a children's series.
Under the deal, DHX Media ("Yo Gabba Gabba!," "Degrassi") will develop and produce 26 22-minute, traditionally animated small-screen episodes of the computer-generated animated feature films. The deal also includes global television and non-U.S. home entertainment exploitation rights to "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs: The Series," with the companies also planning to approach U.S. broadcasters and digital channels with the pitch. The deal also has DHX Media representing merchandising for the television series on a worldwide basis.
"'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' has a tremendous legacy as beloved children's books and a duo of highly popular feature films, showing how great ideas can succeed across media," said Steven DeNure, president and COO of DHX Media. "We believe audiences both old and new are going to love this fiercely funny franchise reimagined for the small screen."
The "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs" films are based on the 1978 childrens book penned by Judi Barrett and illustrated by Ron Barrett and focus on Flint Lockwood, a high school tween who dreams of being a scientist while living in a blue-collar town called Swallow Falls whose primary industry is sardines. Other characters include Sam Sparks, the new girl in school and an aspiring journalist, and Flint's dad, Tim. There's also Steve the Monkey, Manny the head of the school's audiovisual system, school gym teacher (and eventual cop) Earl, baby clothing model Brent, and Mayor Shelbourne, who wins every election on the pro-sardine platform. The first film, which was released in 2009, had a domestic gross of $124,870,275. The 2013 sequel grossed $119,793,567 domestically.
Sony Pictures Digital Productions prexy Bob Osher said he is "thrilled to see the adventures of our beloved characters from 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' further expanded to television for audiences around the world to enjoy" and Rick Mischel, executive producer at Sony Pictures Animation, added that "DHX's track record in creating great kids' television content makes them an ideal partner to capture the unique humor and tone of Flint Lockwood and his friends that made the theatrical franchise so successful."

Company Nearer to Shipping
Videogame Consoles in China
Sony Corp. moved a step closer to shipping videogame consoles in China, as it seeks to join Microsoft Corp. in tapping a market where devices such as PlayStations and Xboxes have long been banned.
According to a filing, a factory in Shanghai몭s free-trade zone affiliated with the Japanese electronics company would start packaging consoles in December. The filing said the facility could package 200,000 consoles a year.
A spokesman for Sony said the 200,000 figure doesn몭t represent an actual business plan, adding its operation will be based on other factors such as the number of software titles it can sell. He declined to comment further on Sony몭s plans.
The filing was an environmental assessment posted by a Sony local partner on the official website of the free-trade zone. It didn몭t specify the type of console that would be shipped.
Sony signed a deal earlier this year with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group Co. to make and sell PlayStation game consoles in China. The move came after the Chinese government in September lifted a 14-year ban on the sale of videogame consoles in the country. Microsoft began selling its Xbox One through the free-trade zone late last month. China has long kept a tight leash on the videogame industry out of concern about violent content. The Xbox One titles approved for sale don몭t include violent games such as the 몮Halo몯 and 몮Call of Duty몯 titles.
The filing was reported by local media in August and on Thursday by Bloomberg News.

About 1,000 workers at a Foxconn Technology Co. plant in southwest China assembling printers and computers for companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. went on strike for several hours this week demanding higher pay.
The Taiwan-based company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., said the workers walked off the job for four hours Wednesday at its production site in Chongqing. About 20 workers went on strike Thursday morning, but further details on that stoppage weren몭t available.
Foxconn is working with its labor union and workers to resolve the dispute, the company said Thursdayin a statement. The company said the strikes didn몭t disrupt production.
Management 몮continuously increased production volumes, and even required individual workers to take on tasks that used to require two workers to handle. The increase in workload wasn몭t compensated,몯 said a worker who declined to be named. He said he participated in the strike.
몮Some workers are not happy because the company [Foxconn] has reduced overtime hours, a key component of their salaries,몯 after H-P cut orders, said a Foxconn official who declined to be named. Workers also demanded the resignation of the factory manager, he said. Also, the company had tried to lay off some workers without paying severance, the official added.
Foxconn filed a complaint with the local police, he said. The reason for the complaint wasn몭t clear.
On the Weibo social-media service, users distributed images that appeared show hundreds of workers gathered outside the Chongqing facility Wednesday, waving protest banners as police officers looked on. The police presence at the factory continued Thursday, according to the worker.
A Chongqing police spokeswoman, however, said she wasn몭t aware of the strike.
Foxconn employs about 30,000 workers at its Chongqing site. The company has more than one million workers in China and is a major supplier to Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp.
The strike came after H-P said earlier this month it planned to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations as it faces intensifying competition from China몭s Lenovo Group Ltd. An H-P representative in Asia didn몭t have an immediate comment.

PepsiCo
Company Raises Forecast
PepsiCo Inc. reported better-than-expected third-quarter results despite continued volatility in emerging markets and sluggish consumer demand in developed markets.
Shares of Pepsi, up 18% over the past year, were up 33 cents at $94.27 on Thursday afternoon. The snacks and beverage maker also raised its earnings view for the year, based on its results for the first three quarters. The company now expects core per-share earnings growth of 9%, up from its prior view of 8% growth.
Pepsi has relied on its snack business lately to offset the impact of weaker demand for soda. Sales of diet soda are declining in the U.S., while concerns about soft drink consumption and obesity are rising. U.S. consumption of diet soda fell 6.3% last year while regular soda fell 1.7%, according to Beverage Digest.
Carbonated-soft-drink volume in the key North American market declined 1.5% in the third quarter, Pepsi said.
The company this month is launching its newest soft drink, a mid-calorie soda called Pepsi True, which will be sold exclusively through Amazon.com Inc.
Chairman and Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said the company still faces a challenging macroeconomic environment, including heightened volatility in emerging markets and weak demand in advanced markets.
Pepsi has batted away calls from activist investor Nelson Peltz몭s Trian Fund Management LP to break up the company몭s snack and beverages businesses, saying it is stronger with both together. PepsiCo has been losing market share to chief drinks rival Coca-Cola Co. for several years in the U.S. and abroad.
For the period ended Sept. 6, Pepsi reported a profit of $2.01 billion, up from $1.92 billion a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to $1.32 from $1.23. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges and other items, earnings were $1.36 a share. Revenue edged up 1.8% to $17.22 billion.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected earnings of $1.29 a share and revenue of $17.07 billion.
Gross margin expanded to 53.6% from 53%.
In its Americas foods business, Frito-Lay North America sales rose 3%. Latin America foods sales climbed 6%, though Quaker Foods North America sales fell 3% on volume declines.
The company몭s Americas beverages unit posted flat sales of $5.38 billion, while European revenue fell 1% to $3.76 billion.

Line Unveils New Features, Not New Finance

TOKYO멪Line Corp., the owner of a popular Japanese smartphone messaging application, on Thursday introduced mobile payments and other new services in an effort to expand without immediate recourse to outside investment.
The company has attracted more than 560 million user accounts in Japan and elsewhere in Asia by offering a free chat app, cutesy digital 몮stickers몯 and catchy games. Line looked set to go public later this year for as much as $9 billion, but those plans were put on hold last month, fueling speculation that it might seek a buyer or tie-up멪a possibility the company몭s chief executive rejected.
몮At this point, we have no intention of accepting capital,몯 Akira Morikawa, Line몭s chief executive, said at a news conference, adding that Line몭s thinking reflected the position of its parent company, Naver Corp. of South Korea. 몮We aren't considering that and won't consider it.몯
Instead, Line몭s focus is on expanding its business by offering new functions to compete with the latest innovations of its main rivals.
In addition to the payment feature, other new services announced Thursday include music streaming, food delivery and digital taxi-hailing, as well as a mapping function that provides detailed floor plans of department stores and other buildings.
Another new function will let users post comments publicly, as on Twitter. Until now, Line has focused on private messaging between users who know each other.
Many of the new services, including Line Pay, closely resemble features previously introduced by WeChat, a messaging platform owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. of China. Along with WhatsApp, which Facebook Inc. recently acquired for $19 billion, WeChat and Line are bidding to become global mobile communications platforms. But WeChat and Line have made only tentative steps beyond Asia so far, and many of the new Line services will only be available in Japan at first.
몮With the presence of strong rivals, we think the U.S. market is challenging,몯 said Takeshi Idezawa, COO of Line. 몮As one of the first steps, we plan to increase our presence there.몯
The new payment system, which Line said it would introduce in Japan this winter, will let users purchase goods and services at participating online and traditional retailers, using their smartphones. They will be able to send credit to other users of the service, or split bills with them. Line Pay, as the function is called, will also work in concert with the other new services, including the taxi-calling feature.
Mr. Morikawa and other Line executives said they would reconsider the possibility of an IPO after the new services are up and running next year멪an approach that analysts said made sense.
몮If they have this payment thing running in the next six months, that could really give them a leg up,몯 said Neha Dharia, an analyst at Ovum, a telecommunications consulting firm. 몮If it몭s successful, it could open up a huge revenue stream for them.몯
But Ms. Dharia said mobile payment services could be difficult to expand to other markets because that would require cooperating with local banks and navigating multiple sets of financial regulation. Line, which generated ?18.2 billion ($168 million) in sales in the April-June quarter, doesn't provide a regional breakdown of its financial results, but analysts say the vast majority of its sales come from Japan.
In Japan, the company has faced rising concern over security, following reports of a number of hacking incidents. For the payment service, it announced beefed-up security measures.
Line몭s new music service, which it is setting up with the music division of Sony Corp. and Avex Group, one of Japan몭s largest independent music companies, will offer subscription music streaming. While subscription streaming has been widely available to smartphone users in other markets for several years, rights holders in Japan have been reluctant to license their music for such services. But plunging sales of CDs and digital downloads have caused them to reassess.
Line also said it was taking steps to broaden the appeal of its mobile games멪until now aimed at mainstream audiences멪to try to attract more serious players. The company said it had formed several joint ventures to develop new games, including one with Gree Inc., one of Japan몭s leading mobile game companies.

 Sony  Is Closer to Shipping PlayStation 4 Videogame Consoles in China; Game Consoles Have Long Been Banned in China

Sony Corp. moved a step closer to shipping videogame consoles in China, as it seeks to join Microsoft Corp. in tapping a market where devices like PlayStations and Xboxes have long been banned.
According to a filing, a factory in Shanghai몭s free-trade zone affiliated with the Japanese electronics company would start packaging consoles in December. The filing said the facility could package 200,000 consoles a year.
A Sony spokesman said the 200,000 figure doesn몭t represent an actual business plan, adding its operation will be based on other factors such as the number of software titles it can sell. He declined to comment further on Sony몭s plans.
The filing was an environmental assessment posted by a Sony local partner on the official website of the free-trade zone. It didn몭t specify the type of console that would be shipped.
Sony signed a deal earlier this year with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group Co. to make and sell PlayStation game consoles in China. The move came after the Chinese government in September lifted a 14-year ban on the sale of videogame consoles in the country.
Microsoft began selling its Xbox One through the free-trade zone late last month.
China has long kept a tight leash on the videogame industry out of concern about violent content. The Xbox One titles approved for sale don몭t include violent games such as the 몮Halo몯 and 몮Call of Duty몯 titles.
The filing was reported by local media in August and on Thursday by Bloomberg News.

Glen Brasington is vice president of marketing at Pernod Ricard Asia, the regional unit of the French distiller. The Hong Kong-based Australian received valuable training as a bartender during his university days. 몮You learn to read people very quickly,몯 he says. He draws on that skill as he travels around Asia promoting high-end spirits and liquor.
Mr. Brasington spoke with the Journal about replacing a keyboard after it met with a cup of tea, skipping meals on flights, and how to remove the wrinkles in Hong Kong-tailored shirts.
How often are you on the road?
Usually from June onwards is when I spend a lot of time going to our markets. In a year, I could easily be traveling for about 130 days. There are 16 Pernod affiliates whom I visit regularly, including Dubai and the Gulf states, through to Japan and down to Indonesia. I go to France, of course, where our head office is located. Now, I몭m more frequently in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, which need a little bit more support with the projects that we몭re running there.
Which airline do you fly the most?
Our company has corporate deals with Cathay Pacific and Air France. Generally, the timing of [Cathay] flights work better for me, especially around Asia, so that몭s what I tend to take. We also do a lot of business with Korean Air. An A380 of theirs even has an Absolut [one of Pernod몭s brands] bar.
Memorable in-flight service?
On a Korean Air flight to Seoul, an air stewardess spilled a cup of tea on my laptop, ruining three hours몭 worth of work. It was an accident and she was incredibly apologetic. Of course, I was furious멪not with her멪but the fact that I had no means of resolving the problem. And to think I had a full-day meeting the next day and the day after.
When I hopped off the flight, the stewardess told me she had called the Sony service center and made an appointment for me. An hour later, she called again, saying that she and her boss, the purser, would personally come for me at my hotel the next morning. They showed up as promised [and] drove me to the repair shop, where they replaced my keyboard. They paid for it. It몭s a story I몭ve told about 50 times because that was certainly service over and beyond expectation.
Favorite hotel?
I like the design style of the Andaz hotel in Shanghai. It몭s really modern and minimal, and the service isn몭t intrusive. I get annoyed, arriving at 1 a.m., and the first thing the butler wants to do is take you on a tour of the room. Another plus for Andaz is that it몭s directly opposite our office. Convenient location, design and efficiency are what make me book a hotel consistently.
How important are a hotel room몭s amenities?
I don몭t spend that much time in my room to be honest. The nature of the business calls for a lot of meetings at our offices and socializing, which in Pernod we call a 몮conviviality moment.몯 That means dinner with my colleagues in the city I몭m visiting at a restaurant or hotel that stocks our products. Then the group moves on to bars that also carry our products, though it몭s not really to drink but more to understand the environment we operate in.
What do you do most of while flying: work, sleep or eat?
I rarely eat on flights. Meals just take too long to lay out and clean up, and this disturbs my work flow. Since I tend to do late afternoon flights, I몭ll try to eat in the lounge before departure.
Favorite airport lounge?
The Wing of [Cathay], of course. I몭m a fan of its beef cheeks, which is one of five dishes on the a la carte menu, paired with our products like Martell in a special yearlong promotion.
Do you spend time in airports?
Yes, because it몭s where I can shop for toiletries and get a haircut or a massage멪things I can never find time to do in my free time. I몭m always at Zara at Hong Kong몭s airport. In fact, retailers like Uniqlo and H&M should be more interested in opening up there to take advantage of travelers who have more time and spending money.
Fitness regimen while traveling?
I have the best intentions but don몭t always have the time to work out. I still bring a skipping rope and goggles anyway.
Favorite travel app?
Skyscanner. It provides a comprehensive list of flights available on a preferred day, their routings, as well as competitive prices.
Travel advice?
If you have your shirts tailored as I do in Hong Kong, specifically ask for easy press material. Hang them up in the bathroom and the steam pretty much gets [out] the wrinkles. I never use the iron in hotels멪they몭re usually covered in gunk.

Smartphone Maker HTC Introduces Waterproof Selfie Camera; Taiwanese Firm Turns to Photo Technology as It Pursues Turnaround

TAIPEI멪While working on a product road map for smartphone maker HTC Corp. earlier this year, company Vice President Jerry Hsiao did some research.
몮British women spend a month of their lives taking selfies,몯 read an article from the British tabloid the Daily Mail that Mr. Hsiao selected for a PowerPoint slideshow highlighting his findings.
While Mr. Hsiao had included the article jokingly in a presentation this week about new products from the Taiwanese company, the observation holds true that people today are often endlessly fascinated with their own images refracted through high-tech gadgets. And long-suffering HTC is hoping that tendency will help it engineer a turnaround.
On Wednesday in New York, HTC, once the world몭s top smartphone maker by volume in 2011, launched a waterproof action camera and software for taking selfie photos, a departure from its usual emphasis on mobile-phone hardware. HTC also unveiled a selfie-focused smartphone to bolster the company몭s midprice Desire line.
It is a strategic change that the company hopes will help it reverse three years of falling sales. Last year, HTC fell out of the world몭s top 10 smartphone brands by shipments amid branding weakness and strong competition from Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea in the high-end market and Chinese rivals such as Xiaomi in the low-cost segment. This month, the company said its third-quarter revenue fell 11% to 41.86 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$1.37 billion), compared with NT$47 billion a year earlier, despite returning to a net profit largely on cost cuts.
Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said in an interview that the company hopes its new products will help it return to sales growth in coming quarters. HTC몭s sales have fallen year-over-year for the past 12 quarters.
HTC몭s $199 Re Camera is a slim tube-shaped camera that can be clipped to a backpack, mounted on a bicycle or taken underwater. It is the company몭s first major venture outside smartphones since its launch of a tablet computer three years ago, and will be sold on Amazon.com and through other retailers and operators. The camera weighs about 2.5 ounces, similar to the weight of an extra-large egg.
HTC Chairwoman Cher Wang has blamed marketing weakness for the company몭s decline. Its third marketing chief in two years left HTC this fall, after an advertising campaign with actor Robert Downey Jr. failed to stem the company몭s sales slide.
In an interview, Ms. Wang said HTC is looking to invest its marketing dollars more effectively. 몮The most important thing is to make the end-user love you,몯 she said.
The smartphone maker released its Zoe slideshow app free for devices powered by Google Inc.몭s Android software and Apple Inc.몭s iOS. Its newly launched selfie app, HTC Eye, offers voice-activated photo-taking and a video-chat feature that keeps a subject몭s face centered in the screen even if the person is walking around. The company plans to eventually make the selfie app available free of charge for non-HTC users.
HTC plans to offer the new smartphone, called Desire Eye, through AT&T Inc. later this month. Unsubsidized, the smartphone would cost between US$450 and US$500, Mr. Chang said. It comes with 13-megapixel cameras on both the front and rear and has a 5.2-inch screen.
A number of competitors await HTC in the selfie-smartphone niche. Samsung, Sony Corp. of Japan and others have also rolled out smartphones with features intended to make it easier to take and edit selfie photos.
With the Re camera, HTC will have to vie against other action-camera makers, such as GoPro Inc. of San Mateo, Calif., although HTC몭s ads are geared toward attracting more mainstream users. GoPro plays up its cameras몭 use for extreme sports.
Gartner analyst C.K. Lu said he doesn몭t expect the nonsmartphone business to become a chief contributor to HTC몭s earnings in the near future. 몮HTC is showing improvement in its midprice smartphone offerings, which were formerly a weakness for the company,몯 he added. 몮HTC could see a sales recovery in the first quarter next year as its midprice line becomes more competitive.몯
But HTC몭s Mr. Hsiao, who has been with the company more than a decade, said the new camera presages bigger change. He said HTC has been 몮reborn몯 multiple times since it was founded in 1997, including its move from contract manufacturing to building its own brand, and switching from personal digital assistants to Android smartphones. And now, it is cameras and software. 몮I think this is a turning point for the company,몯 he said.

Advanced Micro Devices CEO Rory Read Steps Down; Lisa Su Named President, Chief Executive and Board Member

Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a longtime minority player in a key class of computer chips, is shifting leaders as it continues a struggle to bolster its bottom line.
The company said Rory Read has stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer. He will be succeeded by Lisa Su, a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer.
Mr. Read, in a conference call, said the change reflected his regular discussions with AMD몭s board about succession issues. 몮Now is the right time for her to take the reins and continue driving AMD forward,몯 he said.
The Sunnyvale, Calif., company since the 1980s has been a distant No. 2 behind Intel Corp. in selling microprocessor chips for personal computers based on a design called x86.
AMD added another major business in 2006 through a $5.4 billion deal to buy ATI Technologies Inc., a specialist in graphics chips that render images in videogames. That transaction saddled the company with a big debt load, a factor in frequent net losses.
Mr. Read, 52 years old, is a former International Business Machines Corp. executive who joined the company from Lenovo Group Ltd., a major chip customer. He pushed to reduce AMD몭s debts and diversify its business to reduce its reliance on PC chips and the competition with Intel.
One recent success was convincing Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. to use AMD chips in their latest videogame consoles. Mr. Read also pushed the company to develop chips for server systems based on technology licensed from ARM Holdings PLC that is used in most smartphones and tablets.
But older parts of AMD몭s business have been suffering. The company, which once accounted for around a third of the market for x86 chips used in servers, by the second quarter had a share of less than 3% in that market, according to Mercury Research.
Dean McCarron, an analyst at that firm, said AMD몭s share of x86 chips for laptops was 9.6%, down from 16.1% in the year-earlier period. AMD몭s share price has fallen more than 20% since mid-August. The stock slid 5.5% Wednesday to $3.10 in after-hours trading following news of the management change.
In July, AMD said its second-quarter loss narrowed on improved revenue and lower costs, but the company issued a third-quarter revenue forecast below analysts몭 estimates.
Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said Ms. Su is more popular among Wall Street analysts than Mr. Read.
몮AMD needs growth, and they need it quickly or investors will start to get anxious,몯 said Patrick Moorhead, a former AMD executive who now heads the firm Moore Insights & Strategy. 몮Lisa Su is smart, is respected inside and outside the company and I think projects a look of what people expect as an AMD CEO.몯
Ms. Su, another former IBMer, previously worked at Freescale Semiconductor Inc. She is widely credited with deep technical expertise and for helping AMD win deals to place its chips in new gaming consoles, Mr. McCarron said.
She is one of a few female executives at the highest management levels in semiconductors, an industry that relies heavily on electrical engineers. Another exception is Intel President Renee James, who holds the No. 2 spot at that company.
During the conference call, Ms. Su said AMD몭s x86 business remains important but indicated she will largely continue Mr. Read몭s priorities. 몮I do very much believe that diversifying our business is critical,몯 she said.
Mr. Read said he would support the transition in an advisory role through the end of 2014.

Nobel Prize for LED a Morale Booster for Japanese Electronics; Country몭s Sector Has Lost Market Share for Lighting Technology

TOKYO멪The award of the Nobel Prize in physics to three scientists born in Japan stands to boost the morale of the country몭s beleaguered electronics industry, showing how obscure Japanese companies that specialize in parts and materials can still retain a technological edge.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on Tuesday honored the researchers for inventing the blue light-emitting diode, which has made possible lighting that is more energy-efficient than incandescent bulbs. The blue diode, which first appeared in 1992, was needed to produce white light by combining it with red and green diodes, which already existed.
One of the Nobel winners, Shuji Nakamura, was working at a Japanese maker of lighting equipment, Nichia Corp., when the breakthrough occurred. The other two, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano, helped Japanese parts supplier Toyoda Gosei Co. develop LED technology.
Nichia, which Dr. Nakamura left in 1999 in a dispute over compensation for the research, is the world몭s largest maker of LEDs, with $2.09 billion in sales last year, according to research firm IHS.
But Nichia몭s share of the $16 billion LED market was 13% last year, down from 21% in 2005, according to IHS. And while Japan is home to three of the 10 largest suppliers, Nichia, Toyoda Gosei and Stanley Electric Co., the country몭s share of the market is little more than 20%.
몮Japanese companies are losing share because newcomers keep joining the market,몯 said IHS analyst Lee Kun Soo. The rivals include Taiwan몭s Everlight Electronics Co., U.S.-based Cree Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Seoul Semiconductor Co. of South Korea, and several Chinese companies. 몮Japanese companies are going for the higher end, B-to-B applications,몯 Mr. Lee said.
LEDs can be used for simple household lamps or outdoor lighting, where they are slowly replacing incandescent bulbs. LEDs accounted for 15% of sales of household light sources last year, up from 4% in 2009, according to research firm Euromonitor. 몮The publicity generated by this award is likely to boost consumer interest in LED lamps,몯 Euromonitor said. Consumer acceptance has been faster in Asia and continental Europe than in the U.S. and the U.K., the firm said.
Japanese companies have retained an edge in LEDs몭 most lucrative applications, such as automotive headlights and backlights for smartphone screens.
Nichia says it has 23% of the market for high-brightness LEDs, which are used for smartphones and other high-tech purposes.
Apple Inc.몭s website lists Nichia as a supplier. The U.S. company didn't respond to a request for comment, but analysts have said the Japanese company makes LEDs that are used in Apple몭s iPhones. Closely held Nichia, which is based in remote Tokushima prefecture on the island of Shikoku, declined to identify its clients.
While some Japanese electronics firms, such as Panasonic Corp., make consumer LED lighting, Nichia sells only to other businesses. As a result, like other Japanese companies, it may benefit less from the Nobel buzz than the makers of consumer LED products. Japan몭s Sony Corp. three weeks ago forecast a loss of $2.15 billion for the fiscal year through March, much more than it had previously predicted.
In a sign of the shrinking presence of the Japanese electronics industry, the nation몭s biggest consumer technology trade show, now under way outside Tokyo, has drawn the smallest number of exhibitors since the show몭s inception in 2000.

QINGDAO, China멪Dalian Wanda Group Corp., in its aim to build a Chinese version of Hollywood, said it plans to set up an annual fund of one billion yuan, or about $160 million, to lure movie producers to a planned multibillion-dollar studio project.
Wang Jianlin, chairman of the property-and-entertainment conglomerate and one of China몭s richest men, said the company would work with the private sector to annually provide the funding for film and television production at the Oriental Movie Metropolis, a studio project on which Wanda broke ground last year.
The Chinese coastal city of Qingdao will also provide funding, said Wanda, which owns U.S. theater chain AMC Entertainment Group. Wanda initially said Qingdao would provide half the funding, though company officials later said the amount was unspecified.
The fund is part of what Mr. Wang has said is a plan to recreate Hollywood in China.
Standing in front of a room of film producers and studio executives멪including David Glasser, chief operating officer of Weinstein Co., film deal maker John Sloss and Zhang Qiang, the newly tapped head of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.몭s production arm멪Mr. Wang touted the access to funds and facilities that the industry would find in Qingdao.
몮If you don몭t go to China, where will you go?몯 Mr. Wang said.
He added that a district government within Qingdao is promising subsidies of as much as 10% of a production studio몭s annual revenue.
Wanda last year announced an investment of 30 billion yuan to 50 billion yuan in an entertainment center in Qingdao that will partially open in 2016 and will include a theme park, a film museum, a wax museum and a massive film studio.
A number of other Chinese companies and cities have announced plans to set up facilities to lure the entertainment industry. Mr. Wang says he is putting his money where his mouth is to ensure that the project takes off. 몮The Oriental Movie Metropolis will certainly succeed,몯 he said.
In September of last year, he flew out Hollywood stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Nicole Kidman, as well as David Kosse, then-president of the international division of Comcast Corp.몭s Universal Pictures, and Ralph Alexander, a senior executive vice president of Sony Corp.몭s entertainment international operations, to attend the groundbreaking. Mr. Wang said the film studio would be the world몭s largest and told producers that they would benefit from its planned research-and-development and special-effects centers.
Wanda says it has already made inroads in film projects, signing a deal late last year with Weinstein Co. to produce 몮Southpaw,몯 a boxing film starring actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Wanda is also setting up a base for entertainment investments as part of a $1.2 billion real-estate development in Los Angeles.

Taiwan몭s Export Growth Slips; Demand for Electronic Components Partially Offset by Plunge in Smartphone, Petrochemical Sales.

TAIPEI멪Taiwan몭s export growth slipped in September, as strong demand for electronic components ahead of the year-end holiday season were partially offset by a plunge in smartphone and petrochemical sales.
Taiwan shipped $26.43 billion of goods abroad last month, the Ministry of Finance said Tuesday. It was a 4.7% increase from the same month last year but a 5.9% decline from August.
Some economists said export growth might have peaked in August, a month before Apple Inc.몭s official launch of its new iPhones. The Cupertino, California-based company buys parts including microprocessors and camera lenses from Taiwan. But some others said Taiwanese overseas sales in the fourth quarter will likely continue to grow at high single-digit rates, citing strong follow-on orders for the new iPhones and improving demand among U.S. consumers.
Driven by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.몭s sales of computing chips to Apple, exports of semiconductors rose a strong 15% last month from a year earlier, the ministry said. Total overseas sales of electronic goods, which include semiconductors, totaled $8.89 billion in September. It was slightly less than August몭s $9.23 billion, which was a record high.
Component makers from Taiwan are playing a central role in the global electronics supply chain, selling components to Apple and other tech behemoths such as Sony and Microsoft.
However, exports of Taiwanese-made smartphones dived 39% last month. Sales of petrochemicals also dropped 9.2%. The government said falling energy prices led some factories to delay stocking up inventories.
Although Thanksgiving and Christmas are months away, some U.S. retailers have begun offering discounts to lure consumers. Taiwan몭s exports to the U.S., comprising mostly electronics, gained 8.8% last month, sharply higher than a 4.9% rise in August.
However, exports to Europe added only 1.2%, compared with a 13.5% rise in August. Exports to China also slowed as the world몭s second-largest economy still struggled to regain its growth momentum. Shipments to China and Hong Kong, Taiwan몭s biggest export markets, were up 3.6% in September, down from a 8.7% rise in August.
Overall exports have grown 3.5% so far this year, exceeding the government몭s target of a 3.21% rise for the entire year멪but still below the double-digit percentage expansion often seen in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Imports in September rose 0.2% to US$22.93 billion, much slower than August몭s 14.1% rise. The trade surplus decreased to $3.50 billion from $4.11 billion a month earlier.

What몭s Behind Japan몭s Profit Rebound? Unsexy Companies Like Toray; Little Known Abroad, Companies in More Pedestrian Industries Boost Economy Again
By Eric Pfanner

TOKYO멪Corporate Japan is posting record profits again. It has companies like Toray to thank, again.
Toray isn몭t a household name outside Japan. But unlike some such as Sony Corp. that are, Toray Industries Inc. is thriving, along with other companies in more-pedestrian industries that are helping lead Japan몭s comeback from two decades of economic torpor.
Toray helped Japan out of crisis once before: Amid the devastation after World War II, the textile maker was among the big exporters that revived the economy. Today, it exports carbon fiber for Boeing airliners, fabric for Uniqlo underwear, absorbent elements for disposable diapers and hundreds of other materials.
Toray expects to report its highest net income ever in the current fiscal year. By contrast, \b Sony\b0  Corp. says it will report a ?230 billion ($2.1 billion) loss.몮There is always a need for our products in the long term,몯 says Toray President Akihiro Nikkaku of basic-materials makers. 몮It몭s true,몯 he says, 몮consumers do not really know much about it.몯
The travails of Japan몭s famous consumer-electronics industry have fed the narrative of a Japan in decline. But the country is proving to have a resilient base in the more-prosaic companies and industries that are a big part of its profit comeback.
Net income at the country몭s major corporations rose 69% to a record ?25.3 trillion in the fiscal year ended in March from the prior year, according to SMBC Nikko Securities. Major manufacturers몭 net income grew 116% to ?12.1 trillion, and many companies are forecasting further gains for the July-September period.
Those corporate profits are a major factor behind the recent strength of the Nikkei Stock Average, which closed at 16,374.14 on Sept. 25, its highest level since 2007, before falling to 15,708.65 on Friday.
몮Everybody wants to write Japan off, but it몭s still the third-largest economy in the world, and we have to ask why,몯 says Ulrike Schaede, professor of Japanese business at the University of California, San Diego. 몮Everybody focuses on the zombie companies, but there are all these great firms, most of which no one has heard of. It몭s a quiet revolution.몯
Or a quiet restoration.
Japan몭s postwar economic miracle was driven especially by companies that exported materials, parts and industrial products멪not by consumer-goods companies.
Well into the 1960s, Japan몭s top exports were steel, textiles, fish and ships, according to the Japan Foreign Trade Council. In 1962, consumer durable goods represented only 14% of Japan몭s overall exports, according to the Japan Tariff Association.
Global perceptions of 몮Japan Inc.몯 changed during Japan몭s bubble era of the 1980s. Consumer-electronics brands like Sony, Nintendo Co. and Panasonic Corp. were among growth leaders멪along with auto companies멪and came to symbolize Japan몭s ascent abroad.
By 1986, consumer durables rose to 30% of Japan몭s exports. Cars, office appliances, tape recorders and precision devices like cameras joined steel atop Japan몭s export rankings.
But by 2013, consumer durables had receded to 16% of exports. Cars were still Japan몭s top export. But they were followed by steel, electronic parts, auto parts and organic chemicals.
Sony몭s fall from grace has been echoed at some other consumer companies. At Nintendo, sales fell 44% over the last three fiscal years to below the level in the year ended March 1999. A spokesman attributes the decline to the game industry몭s volatility rather than any weakness in connecting with consumers.
In final consumer goods, Japan swung to a $52 billion trade deficit in 2012 from a $25 billion trade surplus in 2007. In contrast, Japan몭s trade surplus in parts used in all sorts of manufacturing grew to $137 billion from $116 billion.
몮Because Japan has clearly lost competitive advantage in consumer electronics몯 says Kathy Matsui, chief Japan equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, 몮it makes sense to go up the value chain and focus on high-end materials and high-value parts.몯
The Nikkei몭s rise also reflects the yen몭s slump, which makes Japan몭s exports more affordable in dollar terms and lifts the value in yen terms of overseas sales. That helps many parts providers, who tend to manufacture more in Japan than finished-goods makers.
Reflecting the pendulum몭s swing back from consumer goods, some giants are returning to their roots. Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp. and NEC Corp., soon after the war, grew by exporting industrial products like locomotives, gas turbines and telecommunications equipment. By the 1980s, they had jumped on the consumer bandwagon, shifting some energies into TV sets, home appliances and, later, smartphones.
They suffered for it. Competitors in countries like South Korea and China eventually undercut their prices. Their smartphones, often designed for the Japanese market, never took off overseas.
Now the three have shed many consumer operations and doubled down on businesses like heavy machinery, industrial electronics and satellites. After posting cumulative losses of ?985 billion for the four fiscal years ended March 2010, Hitachi swung back to a cumulative net income of ?1.03 trillion in the four years since then.
Toshiba and NEC have shown similar, though less dramatic, swings. Hitachi didn몭t respond to inquiries. Toshiba President Hisao Tanaka in May told analysts that the company intended to 몮accelerate our shift to b-to-b.몯 An NEC spokesman says the company 몮is clearly moving towards infrastructure investment.몯
Panasonic몭s remake is particularly striking. A consumer-electronics maker for most of its 96 years, it has quit the consumer-smartphone market, stopped making plasma-screen TV sets and sharply reduced its camera output. It says it sees greater opportunities in areas like auto parts and housing. Panasonic is a major supplier of electric-car batteries, agreeing to invest in Tesla Motors Inc.몭s planned $5 billion Nevada battery plant.
For the latest fiscal year, Panasonic posted net income of ?120 billion after a ?754 billion loss a year earlier. Asked about its transformation, Panasonic points to President Kazuhiro Tsuga몭s public comments in April, when he said the company몭s strategic shift was progressing well.
Then there is the broad base of companies that are little known abroad. Japan hasn몭t made a mark in smartphones. But parts suppliers like Murata Manufacturing Co., Nidec Corp. and Omron Corp. are benefiting from the tiny specialized parts they make for smartphones and other high-tech devices. The three posted strong gains in net income in the latest fiscal year.
In a Bain & Co. list of consistently successful companies멪posting annual growth over 5.5% in sales and earnings over 10 years while delivering profits above cost of capital멪about a third of the 42 Japanese companies listed were in behind-the-scenes industries like car parts, chemicals, construction and engineering. In the 1990s, none of these industries made Bain몭s list.
The shift is toward 몮upstream몯 companies, says Shintaro Okuno, a Bain partner in Tokyo, especially parts makers. 몮It몭s still manufacturing, but a completely different kind of manufacturing.몯
Toray몭s role among such companies was reinforced this summer when Keidanren, the Japanese business lobby, named Toray Chairman Sadayuki Sakakibara its head. He succeeded another leader in industrial materials, Chairman Hiromasa Yonekura of Sumitomo Chemical Co. The two previous heads were from Canon Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp.
Toray started in 1926 as a maker of synthetic fabrics and later branched into other fabrics and chemicals. Textiles were a big ingredient in Japan몭s postwar rebound: In the 1950s, textiles and related products rose to as high as 40% of Japan몭s exports, and Toray became one of the nation몭s major exporters.
As Japan increased consumer exports, Toray, too, sought to get closer to the consumer with branded materials such as Ultrasuede, a synthetic fabric with a leather feel. But Toray continued to develop industrial materials.
Its relationship with Boeing Co. shows how decisions it was making decades ago멪as consumer companies were ascending멪are bearing fruit today.
In the 1970s and 1980s, when some carbon-fiber makers were quitting the business for lack of customers, Toray fine-tuned its technology and manufacturing. That gave it a global advantage when carbon fiber came into its own, says Yoshihiro Azuma, a Jefferies analyst.
In 2006, Toray struck a supply deal with Boeing set to run through 2021 for the 787 jetliner, in which carbon fiber is the main structural material. Expecting increased orders from Boeing, Toray recently announced plans to invest $1 billion in a new South Carolina factory. 몮It몭s a great example of how basic materials can be so powerful that they can substantively change the world,몯 Mr. Nikkaku says.
몮Toray has been a market leader and a valuable contributor to advancements in aerospace design and performance,몯 a Boeing spokesman says.
Long-term supply deals like this helped sustain Toray during Japan몭s economic malaise. Sales dipped during the global recession, and Toray posted losses in the years ended March 2009 and March 2010. It has snapped back, recording a 23% net-income increase in the year ended March 31 from a year earlier on a 15% increase in sales to ?1.8 trillion.
몮With companies like this, the economy has legs to stand on,몯 says Jesper Koll, head of Japan equity research at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 몮Today it몭s Toray, tomorrow it몭s Olympus with a new medical device, the next day it몭s Fujifilm.몯
Over 70% of Olympus Corp.몭s global sales are from medical devices, a spokesman says, and 몮our main business is no longer consumer products.몯 Fujifilm Corp. is expanding into areas such as health care, graphic systems and industrial materials.
Having expanded carbon fiber into everything from fishing rods to windmills, Toray is looking for new markets for it. This year, it bought Zoltek Companies Inc., a U.S. supplier of carbon fiber to the automotive business. It also makes materials used in semiconductor manufacturing, lithium-ion batteries, fiber-optic cables and polypropylene spunbond fiber, an absorbent material in disposable diapers.
Toray is also profiting in its oldest market: clothing. Uniqlo, the Japanese apparel chain owned by Fast Retailing Co., has sold more than 400 million items in its Heattech line of T-shirts, underwear and other clothing made with a new Toray blend of polyester, acrylic, rayon and spandex. Uniqlo declines to discuss details of its Toray relationship.
몮The long-term assumption here is that fiber is a growth industry,몯 says Toray몭s Mr. Nikkaku.
Toray몭s trade-off for long-term supply deals, some analysts say, is its modest profit margins. Its 7.6% return on equity in its most recent year is less than half that of some global chemical-industry leaders, they say.
몮If we were to focus only on immediate issues, we would derail,몯 Mr. Nikkaku says. 몮We always look 10, 20 years ahead.몯 Toray몭s shares are up 13% over the past 12 months, versus the Nikkei몭s 11% rise.
Japanese suppliers of materials and components may eventually lose their global edge, some say. South Korea and China will eventually undercut Japanese parts suppliers just as they did with finished gadgets, says William Saito, a venture capitalist who advises the Japanese government on technology strategy. Japan needs to develop trendsetting consumer products or services to provide the profit margins the economy needs, he says.
Sony, meanwhile, continues to struggle in its consumer markets. In September, it said it expected to post a loss of almost five times what it forecast four months earlier for the current fiscal year as it wrote down the book value of its mobile communications unit.
It is edging out of some consumer businesses, recently selling its PC business and making its TV operation a free-standing unit.
And it is increasing its bet on high-tech components for other people몭s products. While few outside Japan want to buy Sony몭s smartphones, its image sensors for smartphone cameras are used even by Apple Inc. Sony is supplying them for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, says Chipworks, a patent-research firm. Apple didn몭t respond to inquiries. Sony declined to comment.
In July, \b Sony\b0  said it would spend $345 million to increase sensor-production capacity.

* Big Aluminum has spent two years shutting smelters to shrink a supply glut that has led to rotten prices. The strategy has been successful for the most part. But fresh weakness in aluminum prices remains a concern for Alcoa Inc, as some 40 percent of the company's sales in the second quarter of 2014 were still related to the production of aluminum and its raw material, alumina.

Laura Nyro's Heartbreaking Spirit Summoned by "Map to the Treasure" LP
By Steven Chagollan

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - For many people weaned on the music of the '60s/'70s, Laura Nyro was one of those ungraspable artists -- someone they knew of but didn't follow or know much about. She was idolized by David Geffen, who signed her as his first big client, but he couldn't elevate her to commercial stardom as a solo artist. To this day there are debates about her set at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, when she was still in her teens: Was she booed off the stage or embraced as a revelation?
But even if Nyro remained a mystery to the masses, she was a savior to a number of artists who rode her songs to chart-topping success, including Blood, Sweat & Tears ("And When I Die"), Three Dog Night ("Eli's Comin'"), Barbra Streisand ("Stoney End") and, especially, the Fifth Dimension ("Wedding Bell Blues," "Stone Soul Picnic," "Sweet Blindness," "Save the Country').
Sheila Weller's "Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon and the Journey of a Generation" could very well have included Nyro, who died in 1997, since she influenced all those self-empowered singer-songwriters who exhibited an equal facility for rich, confessional storytelling.
Jazz pianist Billy Childs, whose tribute album "Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro" was recently released on Sony Masterworks, calls her "not just a singer-songwriter, but a serious composer." And one just need listen to a track like "Timer," from Nyro's landmark "Eli and the Thirteenth Confession," to hear how she pushed the envelope: a mini-suite with changing tempos, sliding scales and overlapping vocals.
At a Grammy Museum event celebrating the album, and Nyro's music, on Tuesday night, Childs said he thinks of Nyro's work as "an opera about a girl in New York City," and Rickie Lee Jones, one of the vocalists on hand who appears on the album, even summoned the spirit of "West Side Story" in her recollection. "I was always dreaming and it was clear she was dreaming," said Jones. "I was always on fire escapes and she was writing fiction to me."
It was clear Nyro served as a unique inspiration to the talent on hand, including singers Shawn Colvin and Becca Stevens, because they viewed her as a kindred spirit. Jones, who discovered Nyro in the early '70s, recalls that "at the time, Janis Joplin was the main girl and I just could not sing anything like her; I have no roughness in my voice. But Laura had this softness about her. She was a teacher but also someone like me."
The tribute album, a term that Child eschews, attracted an astounding level of talent, all drawn to the heart, heartbreak and complexity of Nyro's music, including Alison Krauss, Dianne Reeves, Renee Fleming, Esperanza Spalding, Yo-Yo Ma, Alison Krauss Wayne Shorter and many others.
Colvin, also present at the Grammy Museum, was under the impression that Nyro hadn't been celebrated in a similar fashion prior, which she thought was "weird." But in fact, the album, "Time and Love: The Music of Laura Nyro" was released in 1997 (Astor Place) and included many of the alternative artists, all female, of the day, including Phoebe Snow, Suzanne Vega, Jane Siberry and Jill Sobule. Although that prior recording is a tad too twee at times, Roseanne Cash's version of "Save the Country" might be worth the purchase alone.
Like Cash, Childs and Colvin's version of the song is more elegaic than the original, upbeat recordings by Nyro and the Fifth Dimension, reflecting, in Childs' words, the tumult of the time when the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King left the country shaken, and the Vietnam war raged on, creating a violent schism of ideologies.
Of her take on the song in "Map to the Treasure," Colvin confided: "I think we nailed the quiet desperation."

Box Office: 'Gone Girl' Surging to $35 Million-Plus Weekend

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are showing solid drawing power as "Gone Girl" heads for an opening weekend of at least $35 million in the U.S., according to early estimates Friday.
Fox's "Gone Girl" looked likely to draw more than $12 million on its opening day at 3,014 locations.
That should be enough to give the thriller a winning weekend over New Line's scarefest "Annabelle," which will probably take in about $14 million Friday and wind up the weekend with an equally impressive $30 million at 3,185.
That scenario would represent a shot in the arm for studios and exhibitors. Should both "Gone Girl" and "Annabelle" finish above $30 million, it would be first time time in two months that two titles have cleared that figure since the Aug. 8-10 frame with "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "Guardians and the Galaxy."
"Annabelle" took in a solid $2.1 million in late-night showings Thursday, topping "Gone Girl," started respectably with $1.25 million at 2,370 sites.
"Gone Girl" appears to be effectively leveraging the poularity of Gillian Flynn's novel, in which a husband in a fading marriage becomes the key suspect in his wife's disappearance. Promotions for "Gone Girl" have taken taken advantage of Affleck's considerable star power with a voice in one trailer asking, "How does it feel to be the most hated man in America?"
Both "Gone Girl" and "Annabelle" are R-rated and have been aimed at attracting mature audiences.
David Fincher directed "Gone Girl" with Fox and New Regency producing for $61 million.
"Annabelle," which stars Annabelle Wallis, will make back its $6.5 million budget on its first day. New Line and Warner Bros. appear to have tapped into the surprise success of "The Conjuring," which introduced the creepy Annabelle doll as part of its catalog of possessed objects.
"Annabelle" is directed by John R. Leonetti (James Wan's longtime cinematographer) from Gary Dauberman 's script with Peter Safran and Wan producing.
Conversely, Nicholas Cage's faith-based "Left Behind" appeared to be showing little traction with a first-day gross of $900,000 for Freestyle, projecting to about $2.7 million for the weekend.
Denzel Washington's "The Equalizer" led the rest of the pack with an early estimate of $5.5 million on Friday, portending a second weekend of about $18 million for Sony - a decline of about 47%, which would give it about $64 million for its first 10 days.
Fox's third weekend of "The Maze Runner" looked likely to finish fourth with $3 million on Friday and a $10 million weekend, edging Focus' second weekend of "The Boxtrolls" at about $9 million.

Angry Birds Maker Rovio to Cut up to 130 Jobs in Finland; Games Maker to Simplify Organization Around Areas of Growth Potential

STOCKHOLM멪몮Angry Birds몯 maker Rovio Entertainment Ltd. admitted Thursday to counting its chickens before they were hatched.
The Finnish games company, which shot to fame with the online and mobile game featuring colored, flying birds, said it would eliminate 130 employees, or about 16% of its workforce, amid flattening revenue and difficulties finding fresh growth opportunities. The company said it had bulked up its staff in anticipation of stronger growth.
몮We have been building our team on assumptions of faster growth than have materialized,몯 the company said in a statement.
Rovio said it plans to reduce the size of its staff in an effort to simplify its organization around its three businesses with the 몮highest growth potential몯: games, media and consumer products.
It didn몭t say Thursday which staff would be cut, or which of its operations it would downsize, and wasn몭t immediately available to elaborate. Rovio had more than 800 employees as of June, up from about 500 at the end of 2012.
Rovio and the 몮Angry Birds몯 game series have seen their wings clipped in recent years amid stiff competition from a new breed of mobile games developers, such as Supercell Oy and Anglo-Swedish King Digital Entertainment PLC, the maker of 몮Candy Crush Saga.몯
These companies have beefed up marketing expenses to the point that it is hard for companies with smaller balance sheets to break through. King Digital, for instance, last year spent considerably more marketing money to acquire and retain users than Rovio몭s annual sales.
King몭s revenue last year was $1.9 billion and the company says it commits a quarter of revenue to marketing, around half a billion last year. Rovio몭s revenue, meanwhile, was $197 million, which means that King spent more than twice Rovio몭s revenue on marketing alone.
Rovio has invested heavily into an 몮Angry Birds몯-themed movie, set to hit the big screens in 2016. Starring Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones and Jason Sudeikis, the project is Rovio몭s largest-ever investment and will be distributed by Sony Pictures.
The staff cuts follow a decision in August to replace Chief Executive Mikael Hed, the son of Rovio몭s chairman Kaj Hed and a major shareholder in the company, who will step down from his position as of January next year.
Mr. Hed, who will be succeeded by Nokia Corp. veteran Pekka Rantala, has attempted to overhaul Rovio몭s games revenue model, making downloads free and charging users for purchases made when in the game.
Recent releases, however, haven몭t made much of an impact and Mr. Hed admitted in an earlier interview that his efforts to turn the company around have taken longer than anticipated.
Last year, the closely held company saw revenue flattening significantly compared with its recent years of strong growth, as it booked 瞼56 million ($197 million) in revenue, from 瞼52.2 million in the previous year. Net profit, meanwhile, more than halved to 鈐6.9 million.
Last month, Rovio released the latest game in the Angry Birds몭 franchise, a free-to-play slingshot game called Stella, largely aimed at a female audience. Although it was initially downloaded in large numbers, Stella failed to make much money and isn몭t among the hundred best-grossing mobile apps in the U.S. on either Google Inc.몭s Play Store or Apple Inc.몭s App Store.
Stella몭s dismal financial performance follows several recent flops from the company, including 몮Angry Birds Epic,몯 a role-playing game; and 몮Angry Birds GO!,몯 a racing game멪both of which had millions of installs and received good reviews. But they failed to nail the free-to-play model that has proved so profitable for some of Rovio몭s peers.
The company has also tried to depart from the Angry Birds brand, with games such as Amazing Alex, a Rube Goldberg device-building game; and Tiny Thief, a stealth-based puzzle game; neither saw much commercial success.
Amid the company몭s paltry performance, a number of executives have left the company, including the company몭s former chief operating officer, and the executive in charge of game development. Tuomas Erikoinen, who created the original artwork for Angry Birds and designed its first characters, left the company to form another game developer in 2012.

SoftBank to Sell  Sony  Flagship Phone; Xperia Z3 Has 4K-Video and PlayStation 4 Remote Play Functions

TOKYO멪SoftBank Corp. will carry Sony Corp.'s latest smartphone, the two companies confirmed on Wednesday, possibly giving the heavily diversified electronics maker's struggling mobile business a lift.
The Wall Street Journal reported in August that SoftBank will likely sell the Xperia Z3 for the first time in Japan, and also in the U.S., through its subsidiary Sprint Corp. A SoftBank spokesman said that Wednesday's announcement just pertains to the domestic market.
Sony's flagship smartphone comes with high-resolution audio, 4K-video and PlayStation 4 remote play functions. It will be available from November and will be free of charge in Japan for people switching from other carriers after the completion of a two-year contract.
It was only last month that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai apologized to investors after the company said its projected net loss for the fiscal year ending in March next year would expand to ?230 billion ($2.12 billion)멪almost five times what it said previously. Sony blamed the company's mobile business, which Mr. Hirai said was struggling due to increasing competition. At the news conference, he said the company will be focusing on premium models rather than entry models, and it will be selective on which markets it sells the Xperia smartphone to.
The announcement means all three major Japanese mobile-phone carriers멪SoftBank, NTT Docomo Inc. and KDDI Corp.멪will sell Sony's smartphones. Analysts say the key for Sony to prop up its mobile business is to have a presence in big markets like the U.S. Sprint is very likely to announce they will sell the Xperia soon, people familiar with the situation said.

U.S. regulators look into treating Internet TV like cable

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering a change in how it regulates Internet TV, potentially putting it on the same footing as traditional cable and satellite television, an FCC official familiar with the idea said on Tuesday.
If formalized and approved, the change would help Internet TV services, such as ones being developed by Dish Network Corp , Sony Corp and Verizon Communications Inc , compete with traditional pay-TV for digital rights to major network programming.
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, however, indicated the plan has not been circulated yet to the four FCC commissioners, who would have to vote to formally propose it and begin the process of collecting public comments.
"Somebody found out that it was an idea that was being kicked around ... and that's where it stands," Wheeler said Tuesday. "I'm not ready to plant the flag," he added.
The idea concerns online subscription video services that offer scheduled programming similar to traditional pay-TV providers, and not online video services such as Netflix Inc that stream content on-demand.
Traditionally, the FCC has ensured that cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp could negotiate for rights to retransmit major network programming. Online video services have not had the same regulatory backing because they rely on a different technology and do not have their own video distribution facilities.
Now, the FCC's Media Bureau is proposing leveling the playing field with a technology-neutral definition of a "multichannel video program distributor," said the FCC official who spoke anonymously to discuss matters that have not been made public. The goal behind the plan is to encourage new and stronger competition in the video market.
"You want to make sure that you're always keeping up with technology, you're always keeping up with innovations in the marketplace. This falls into that kind of category," Wheeler told reporters, when asked what prompted the consideration.
A draft of the proposal tentatively concludes that Internet TV services should have the same access to major network programming as traditional pay-TV services and seeks comments on whether the obligations imposed on the two types of video services should also be the same, the FCC official said.
It was unclear how quickly the proposal could come up for a vote by FCC commissioners, but it could potentially be as soon as Oct. 17.
If adopted, analysts see the proposal as creating a possible new opening for Aereo, a video streaming company whose business model was questioned by a Supreme Court ruling in June that said the company had infringed broadcasters' copyrights by capturing live and recorded programs through antennas and transmitting them to subscribers.

U.S. judge reduces copyright verdict against ex-MP3tunes chief

Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.   
Sept 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday reduced a $48 million copyright infringement verdict against the former chief executive of defunct online music storage firm MP3tunes, the latest turn in long running court battles between the music industry and online content providers.               
U.S. District Judge William Pauley III in Manhattan cut a punitive damages award to $750,000 from $7.5 million, and additional aspects of the ruling could reduce the total amount further, according to an attorney for ex-MP3tunes Chief Executive Officer Michael Robertson.               
The judge gave both sides until Oct. 17 to submit proposals for a final judgment.               
EMI Group Ltd contended in a 2007 lawsuit that the MP3tunes website and a related one called Sideload.com enabled the infringement of copyrights in sound recordings, musical compositions and cover art.               
In the years since the lawsuit was filed, EMI was split up, with Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group buying its recording music business and a consortium led by Sony Corp  acquiring its publishing arm in 2012.               
Earlier this year a Manhattan jury found MP3tunes and Robertson liable for copyright infringement and awarded $48.1 million in damages.               
After the reduction in punitive damages on Monday, the music companies can either accept the decision or embark on a new trial on punitive damages, the ruling said.               
Other legal findings made by Pauley will make the total verdict "closer to $10 million than $40 million," said Robertson's attorney Ira Sacks. Attorneys for the music companies could not immediately be reached for comment.               
Founded in 2005 initially as a website selling independent musicians' songs, San Diego-based MP3tunes came to be known for its so-called cloud music service that allowed users to store music in online lockers. The lawsuit was regarded in some circles as a barometer for how courts might view cloud-based music storage services.               
"While the world has moved beyond the free-MP3-download craze, the parties in this case have not," Pauley wrote.

Can GoPro Hero4 Make You a Vacation Hero?; New Line of Cameras Brings Extreme Photography Down to Earth, but Stock Up on Batteries

GoPro Inc., the company known for rugged little cameras used by extreme surfers and snowboarders, has new models that might appeal to a more timid demographic.
In stores Oct. 5, the first new cameras since GoPro몭s blockbuster summer initial public offering aren몭t big reinventions. They몭re subtle but important improvements to help the less extreme among us create the whoa-check-that-out perspectives that made GoPro a cultural phenomenon.
One is a $400 version called Hero4 Silver that adds a touch screen, finally making GoPro as easy to use as normal cameras. Another is a new version of its palm-size camera that몭s cheap enough멪$130멪to lose or break on vacation. (A third, the $500 Hero4 Black, will appeal to pros, with a faster processor for shooting video at four times the resolution of high definition.)
I몭ve had a chance to dangle two of the new GoPros out of a cable car, clamp them to a go-kart, and strap them to a 몮selfie stick몯멪among other vacationing challenges멪and the experience was eye-opening. The cameras suffer from a short 2.5-hour battery life, but GoPro is now worth considering as the go-anywhere camera for the rest of us.
Don몭t we have smartphones for that? Those cameras have gotten remarkably good at taking photos and video, and are usually close at hand to capture a moment. But GoPros can do two things most smartphones can몭t: First, you can stick them places a phone might not fit, or you might not like. Second, GoPros have a 170 degree wide-angle lens that makes it easy to capture most situations in focus.
Here몭s the problem: Nobody really wants to watch our boring vacation videos. Does a GoPro help produce footage of a less thrill-seeking life that is worthy of Facebook and YouTube?
To answer, I spent last Thursday as a tourist in my town of San Francisco, with one GoPro in my hand and another strapped to my head. The day몭s events were planned by GoPro for training but all the footage you see in this review is my own. Our itinerary included riding a cable car and go-karts, taking a boat ride around San Francisco Bay, and trampolining멪yes, trampolining멪by the Golden Gate Bridge. I continued testing the cameras through the weekend, capturing more ordinary moments: a mountain hike, a drive around town and a sunset. Even then, I found myself taking shots with the GoPros I couldn몭t멪or just hadn몭t멪with other cameras.
GoPro isn몭t the only small camera on the market; Sony and Garmin make models that are only a tad larger, and smartphone maker HTC has hinted at a coming waterproof camera.
What makes GoPros so effective is solid imaging technology in a tiny package that doesn몭t feel precious. You accessorize them with a collection of straps and clamping doodads that encourage멪actually, demand멪experimentation, like the 몮Chesty몯 chest mount and 몮Fetch몯 dog-harness mount. There몭s even a line of mounts for guitars and drums.
The new cameras tout improved sensors and processors that mean better shots and more creative options.
Since the top-model Hero4 Black shoots 4K video at 30 frames a second, I used it to zoom in on the Golden Gate Bridge when I couldn몭t get close enough to fill the frame. (Warning: the video files it produces at that resolution are gargantuan멪five minutes takes up more than two gigabytes on a storage card, sold separately.)
The image quality isn몭t as professional as a digital SLR camera but it is impressive for such a portable package. In my tests on a swaying boat at night, the Hero4 Silver몭s wide-angle lens picked up clouds above a cityscape more dramatically than the iPhone 6 but wasn몭t as good at capturing neon signs. I also made a cool time-lapse video of a sunset by making the GoPro take a 12-megapixel photo twice a minute over a few hours; both Hero4 models can take up to 30 of those a second.
For video, you몭re able to shoot up to 120 frames a second멪the number of still images that combine to create motion멪letting you use GoPro몭s editing software to slow down the action and make anyone look like a character from 몮The Matrix.몯 (It helps if you have a trampoline handy.) A button lets you tag interesting moments that you want to find quickly when it comes time to edit. I wish GoPros also had GPS technology so I could tag locations, too.
Previous models may have helped extreme athletes capture insane video but they didn몭t have LCD screens and were cumbersome to use. The addition of a display to the Hero4 Silver makes it much more user friendly. Controlling the camera from the screen on the back means you can preview shots, and get less up-the-nose footage of you fiddling with button s while the camera is rolling. (GoPro has previously sold a $70 add-on touchscreen, but it added bulk to the camera.)
Alas, the built-in screen is only on the new Hero4 Silver model. The Hero and Hero4 Black have streamlined their menus but still must be controlled with three buttons and a dim black-and-gray screen on the front. I recommend the Silver model for anyone but the pros.
My biggest reservation is that both Hero4 cameras I tested still have too-short battery lives멪about 2.5 hours. (I burned through three or four batteries in a day of heavy usage.) The screen on the Silver model is an even further tax; anyone thinking about taking one on vacation will want to carry a few battery backups, which cost $20.
I wasn몭t able to evaluate one other important factor: how easy it is to get footage from the new GoPros online. GoPros have wireless connections, and the company is building a new version of its smartphone app that will let you control your camera, view what you몭ve taken, and share photos via Instagram and Facebook. I couldn몭t test it멪the app isn몭t finished멪but it was clear from a brief demo that using the app will be yet another drain the camera몭s lightweight battery.
To get video and photos online, I used GoPro Studio on my computer. GoPro몭s editing software is powerful but lacks a simple way to post to the Internet.
My time with the cameras did produce Instagram-worthy footage. But could I have done the same thing without a GoPro if I put my mind to it?
When I was crossing San Francisco몭s Bay Bridge on Saturday, I attached a GoPro to one of its 몮3-Way몯 stick mounts, and poked it out of my passenger window like a periscope. On such a windy bridge, this felt unwise at first, but the driver of a car next to me flashed me a broad smile that read, 몮Righteous, dude.몯
The camera stayed in its mount and captured the whole span. It몭s an amazing video, especially when sped up. I몭ve always dreamed of taking that shot but never would have done it with my phone or, God forbid, fancy DSLR.
Having a GoPro gave me the excuse to go out and try more interesting shots, which is ultimately the key to less-boring footage.

Musical Trips, Temporal & Geographic

Even though Herb Alpert and Sergio Mendes have both been steadily making music for well over 50 years, the music of those two tightly interconnected instrumentalist-producer-maestros, who both currently have new releases out, is extricably associated with the mid-to-late 1960s.
Apart from the way their careers and personal lives have been linked멪Lani Hall, most famously a singer in Mr. Mendes's ensemble, who has been Mrs. Alpert since 1973멪the two have a lot in common: They're both among the final artists who achieved blockbuster hits as interpreters of songs composed by others (prior to the takeover by singer-songwriters at the start of the 1970s). And, perhaps not coincidentally, they're also among the few hitmakers of the rock 'n' roll era whose appeal wasn't specific to any one generation. During The Great Society years, kids were buying the Rolling Stones and The Supremes, while their parents bought Dean Martin and Perry Como. But everybody bought Sergio Mendes's Brasil '66 and Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass.
Now Mr. Alpert's "In the Mood" (Shout! Factory) and Mr. Mendes's "Magic" (Sony) show the two auteurs at their best and, on different tracks, at their most populist멪which is not always the same thing. "In the Mood" doesn't include the famous swing-era song that inspired the album's title, but it does begin with another landmark hit for the Glenn Miller Orchestra, "Chattanooga Choo Choo." The first sounds we hear on the album are electronically generated beats, which may cause you to assume for a minute that Mr. Alpert has changed the name of his ensemble to the Tijuana Techno. But the famous Harry Warren melody quickly arrives in the form of Mr. Alpert's signature brass sound, and the articulation of said trumpets, though acoustic, suggests that they've been fed into a sampler and played back on a keyboard.
In a recent appearance at the Cafe Carlyle, Mr. Alpert told audiences that his first inspiration as a trumpeter was Ziggy Elman (best known for his work with Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey), a likely role model for an aspiring Jewish trumpeter who grew up during the big band era. But the use of a shuffle-style backbeat on such swing anthems as "Choo Choo," "Begin the Beguine" and "Blue Moon" points to Jonah Jones, who made a series of pop trumpet albums in the late 1950s that set familiar standards to a danceable shuffle beat in a way that could be considered a precedent for the Tijuana Brass a decade later.
Even more than Mr. Alpert's own playing, it was the use of well-crafted arrangements that made the Tijuana Brass such a success 50 years ago, and while he also scored as a vocalist with "This Guy's in Love With You," he's a considerably better singer on his horn, as he shows on "When Sunny Gets Blue," the Nat King Cole-associated standard on the new album. There's no fancy chart here, just Mr. Alpert playing Marvin Fisher's melody with much obvious love, delineating it deliberately and meaningfully. It's the most exposed and vulnerable Mr. Alpert has ever sounded on record.
Mr. Mendes's "Magic" proves that his music has been, since his first album in the early '60s, a kind of musical feijoada, a Brazilian stew, in which the basic ingredient, the soup stock as it were, is Mr. Mendes's familiar samba beat. Over this basic beat he's consistently added a mix of fresh ingredients that fit the era, like jazz solos and well-known pop hits (Paul Simon, the Beatles) in the 1960s, a heavier funk beat in the '70s and, now on one track on the current album ("My My My My Love," featuring Cody Wise and produced by rap star will.i.am), autotune-adjusted synthesized vocals in the 21st-century style. John Legend's guest shot on "Don't Say Goodbye" shows how perfect the Mendes sound is for backing up a wide range of celebrity singers, from Eartha Kitt and Tom Jones in the early years of the Brasil bands to, more recently, the hip-hop stars the Black Eyed Peas.
The tracks with Brazilian guests, however, fall more into line with Mr. Mendes's classic early ensembles, and are overall the album's most successful.
Baritone Seu Jorge evokes both romance and a party atmosphere, whether singing or speaking, on "Sou Eu," a South American standard by composer Moacir Santos, whom Wynton Marsalis has dubbed "The Duke Ellington of Brazil." The beats on Milton Nascimento's "Olha a Rua" (with a vocal by the composer) and "One Nation," co-written by Mr. Mendes and guest vocalist Carlinhos Brown, both split the difference between dancing and parading down the street during Carnival. Deep-voiced Ana Carolina delivers the most sensual vocal of the set on "Atlantica"; Mika Mutti follows her with beautifully vocalized harmonica lines that turn the number into a virtual love duet, and then, when Mr. Mendes begins singing with the two of them, it becomes a m?nage ? trois. "Meu Rio," with a vocal by Maria Gadu, adds strings to the mix in the form of a solo cello and percussion in the form of handclaps, which suggests flamenco.
Mr. Mendes's voyage is mainly geographic, covering South and North America, the old world and the new; Mr. Alpert's is temporal, as he conjoins the big band era with both the Brill Building period ("All I Have to Do Is Dream," "Spanish Harlem" from the early 1960s) and the contemporary era. If the vitality of the best tracks on both of these albums is any indication, both of these musical journeys are far from complete.

FCC Considers Regulations for Web-Video Services; Cable-Like Subscriptions Could Get Protections, but Also Obligations

The Federal Communications Commission is considering regulations for companies that provide cable-like subscription video services via the Internet, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.
The move could have major implications for companies such as Sony Corp., Dish Network Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc., all of which are planning to launch online video services멪often called over-the-top, or OTT멪aimed at consumers who don't have traditional pay-TV subscriptions.
At issue is whether such online providers should be regulated in the same manner that the FCC currently regulates traditional cable and satellite companies, or "multichannel video program distributors."
If the FCC adopts such regulations, it would mean that an online provider would have the same ability to negotiate for carriage of local broadcast TV stations that cable and satellite TV providers have. It could also make it harder for a distributor that owns TV channels멪such as Comcast Corp.멪to refuse to license them to an online service.
Still, there are many issues that need to be worked out with regards to how OTT companies would be regulated and whether they would face the same franchise fees and taxes as traditional video providers and have the same public interest obligations such as providing closed captioning for programming.
An FCC spokesperson declined to comment.
This proceeding wouldn't apply to streaming services from Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Hulu LLC, as they don't carry traditional TV channels but instead offer content on-demand.
The FCC initially launched a rule-making proceeding regarding the regulation of subscription online video services in 2012 after a Web programmer, Sky Angel LLC, filed a complaint about Discovery Communications Inc. Sky Angel charged that Discovery pulled out of a deal to offer programming to the online service in violation of the FCC's program access rules. The FCC tentatively sided with Discovery, saying Sky Angel didn't meet the requirements to be classified like a cable or satellite company because it didn't own or control its distribution facilities.
The rule-making process went dormant, but the FCC is now reviving it. "The fact that they are resurrecting it is some indication that they are taking it seriously" that online cable operators are bringing services to market, said media analyst Craig Moffett.
The media industry in the past has been split on the issue of how to regulate Web-based services. Comcast argued against regulating them in 2012, in part, the company said, because the industry is still growing and would be hampered by having to meet all the regulatory requirements of cable operators.
But satellite broadcaster DirecTV countered that if an online video player is going to act like a cable or satellite company, it should be regulated the same way.

N.Y. Film Fest 'the Holy Grail' for 'Whiplash' Director

After showing at Sundance, Cannes and Toronto, the new movie "Whiplash"멪out Oct. 10 from Sony Pictures Classics멪screened at the New York Film Festival on Sunday night.
The area festival "is kind of like the Holy Grail," said the film's 29-year-old writer and director Damien Chazelle, who grew up in Princeton, N.J., reading about films showing there.
"I couldn't afford tickets," he added, at a dinner before the premiere at the restaurant Smith.
"Whiplash," a kind of "Black Swan" for the jazz-drumming set, is based on Mr. Chazelle's experiences at Princeton High School, which had a particularly competitive and nationally renowned jazz band. In the film, which is at times harrowing and at times comic, Miles Teller plays a first-year drummer at a New York City conservatory dealing with the pressures foisted on him by an aggressive, abusive and passionate music teacher, played by the character actor J.K. Simmons.
Downtown Los Angeles substituted for much of New York during filming, Mr. Chazelle said. "We were able to get enough budget to shoot in New York for an afternoon," including Carnegie Hall, but downtown L.A., he said, "helped paint a portrait less of what New York City is now than a child's nightmare view of a '70s New York."
To conjure excitement for a full-length film, Mr. Chazelle originally made a 20-minute short on a $25,000 budget, which showed at last year's New York Film Festival. For the short, Jason Reitman, one of the producers of "Whiplash," suggested Mr. Simmons, who had starred in Mr. Reitman's "Juno."
When raising money for the feature, financiers suggested actors like Kevin Kline, Kevin Spacey or Jeff Daniels for the role, said Mr. Chazelle. The director demurred and now Mr. Simmons has one of the most buzzed-about performances of the fall film season.
After the screening, Mr. Chazelle was asked exactly how key a drummer is to a jazz band. "Well, not really at all," he said. "But conductors have a special thing about drummers."
What they do might not look very hard, he said, "but without the drum, the whole band collapses."

BREAKINGVIEWS- SoftBank and Shrek may lack on-screen chemistry

HONG KONG, Sept 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - SoftBank's acquisition strategy is nothing if not animated, but it's not always easy to see a clear plot. The Japanese conglomerate's next move could be a bid for DreamWorks Animation worth $3.4 billion, according to The Hollywood Reporter. SoftBank's giant balance sheet could easily absorb the hit and miss earnings of film production. Yet with each big buy, it becomes less clear how the group's parts fit together.
Compared with abortive plans earlier this year to bid for U.S. mobile carrier T-Mobile, a tilt at the studio that created titles like "Shrek" and "Madagascar" looks tiny. But it adds to a series of modestly sized deals in content, including its recent consolidation of the world's top two mobile games companies, Supercell and GungHo Online Entertainment. Talks for Vivendi's Universal Music were mooted last year but came to naught.
DreamWorks Animation's biggest challenge as a listed company has been lumpy earnings, thanks to a hit-and-miss pipeline of films. While "Shrek" wowed, last year's "Turbo" was a flop. That's where SoftBank's sheer size could be an advantage. The reported price tag implies a premium of around one-fifth to the animation house's current enterprise value, using a broad interpretation of debt. Yet based on Eikon forecasts for the current financial year, DreamWorks Animation's net loss would be less than 0.1 percent of SoftBank's earnings.
SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son is a proven dealmaker - he arranged a $20 million investment in Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba that is now worth $71 billion. That suggests investors would be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. That's a good job: fellow Japanese tech giant Sony took a multi-billion writedown on its 1989 purchase of Columbia Pictures.
Explaining the storyline to investors still needs thought. SoftBank is relatively highly geared for a Japanese company at 3.1 times net debt to EBITDA, based on annualised earnings for the first quarter. And it already has a collection of more than 1,300 stakes in companies varying from video streaming platforms to U.S mobile carrier Sprint. Alibaba proved a good bet, but at some point Son will have to more clearly explain his vision for what distinguishes a smash hit from a rotten tomato.

'Equalizer' Takes Top Spot; Action Film Starring Denzel Washington Beats Out Holdover 'The Maze Runner'

"The Equalizer" topped the box office with an estimated $35 million debut, giving star Denzel Washington another strong weekend opening.
Based on the 1980s television show of the same name, "The Equalizer" features Mr. Washington as a vigilante who comes out of retirement to help save a young woman in trouble with the Russian mob. The action movie was directed by Antoine Fuqua, who teamed with Mr. Washington on his Oscar-winning role in 2001's "Training Day."
Holdover "The Maze Runner," from Twentieth Century Fox, landed in second place, grossing $17.5 million for a two-week total of $58 million.
Trailing close behind was the weekend's other new release, "The Boxtrolls," which arrived in third place with $17.3 million. It is a company best for the Laika animation studio that made the family film; its most successful movie to date, "Coraline" opened to $16.8 million in 2009 and went on to gross $75.3 million. Laika is owned by Nike Inc. Chairman Phil Knight. "The Boxtrolls" features the voices of Ben Kingsley and Elle Fanning in a story about an orphan raised by trash-collecting trolls. It was distributed by Focus Features, a specialty division of Comcast Corp.'s Universal Pictures.
"The Boxtrolls" was the first animated film to hit theaters since July's "Planes: Fire and Rescue," and won't face competition again from family fare until "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day" is released on Oct. 10.
The opening performance of "The Equalizer" puts the film in the territory of 2012's "Safe House," which also starred Mr. Washington and opened to $40.2 million before grossing $126.4 million. "The Equalizer," co-financed by Village Roadshow Pictures with a budget of $55 million, was distributed by Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures.
Audiences gave the film an A- grade, according to the CinemaScore market research firm. "The Boxtrolls" received a B+.
Of last week's new releases, "This Is Where I Leave You," with Tina Fey and Jason Bateman, held on strongest, falling 39% for a weekend gross of $7 million. Liam Neeson's thriller "A Walk Among the Tombstones" appears to have been hurt by the arrival of Mr. Washington's latest action-hero turn; it plummeted 67% to gross $4.2 million in seventh place.
Fox's parent company, 21st Century Fox, was until mid-2013 part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.

SoftBank Is in Talks With DreamWorks Animation; Japanese Telecom Considers Acquisition, Investment in Studio After Dropping T-Mobile Pursuit

SoftBank Corp. is in talks to buy or otherwise link up with DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., people familiar with the negotiations said, a deal that could help the Japanese company and the Hollywood studio as they seek new ways to compete with rivals world-wide.
Coming nearly two months after SoftBank dropped a possible bid for T-Mobile US Inc., a DreamWorks Animation deal could give the conglomerate's Sprint Corp. unit another way to try to challenge top U.S. mobile carriers AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.
Rather than directly expand his telecommunications network, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son now appears to be focusing more on acquiring content creators, mostly videogame studios so far, whose products can be used to woo potential mobile subscribers.
Mr. Son early last month decided against bidding for T-Mobile, the fourth-largest U.S. cellular operator, and combining it with No. 3 Sprint, amid antitrust concerns in Washington.
SoftBank is well positioned for acquisitions in part because of billions of dollars in paper gains from the recent initial public offering of Chinese Internet company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., of which SoftBank owns 32%.
The people familiar with the talks declined to disclose a possible price for DreamWorks Animation, the market value of which is about $2 billion. One of the people said the talks were in the early stages and could lead to a distribution partnership or a SoftBank investment in DreamWorks, rather than an outright purchase. The talks were reported Saturday evening by the Hollywood Reporter.
DreamWorks Animation has long struggled as a relatively small, publicly traded movie studio and being absorbed by a conglomerate like SoftBank could shield the studio from investor pressure. The U.S. company's stock tends to rise or fall based on individual movies' financial performance, and a string of recent disappointments has cut the company's share price almost in half since 2010.
The studio has released some of the biggest hits in animation history, including the "Shrek" and "Madagascar" films. But more recent titles, such as "Rise of the Guardians" and "Turbo," have been much less successful.
CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has been touting a strategy to reduce his company's reliance on the two or three feature films it makes each year by expanding into television, online video and consumer products. But given DreamWorks Animation's modest size it would be nearly impossible to build a global infrastructure that could compete meaningfully with the theme parks, television networks and consumer-products division owned by big companies like Walt Disney Co.
DreamWorks Animation also faces competition from smaller, nimbler rivals, such as "Ice Age" producer Blue Sky Studios Inc. and "Despicable Me" creator Illumination Entertainment. Those closely held studios' success at the box office, often with movies that cost less than DreamWorks productions, have put pressure on Mr. Katzenberg to reduce his studio's costs.
A deal with SoftBank would help the Glendale, Calif., studio expand in the fast-growing Asia market. Two years ago, DreamWorks Animation joined several Chinese investment companies to set up a studio in China to create animated and action films for global audiences.
Though DreamWorks Animation is a small studio, it has a high profile because it is headed by Mr. Katzenberg, who founded the broader DreamWorks SKG studio with former music executive David Geffen and movie director Steven Spielberg. The animation studio spun off in 2004.
DreamWorks Animation reported a second-quarter net loss of $15.4 million on revenue of $122.3 million. The company's movies are released through the Twentieth Century Fox unit of 21st Century Fox, which until last year was part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.
With his pursuit of DreamWorks Animation, Mr. Son becomes the first prominent Japanese investor to pursue Hollywood since a quarter-century ago, when Japanese electronics companies snapped up studio assets.
He has said he wants to make SoftBank the biggest company in the world and recently told investors that he intended to increase its market value to ?200 trillion, or nearly $2 trillion, by 2040 from just shy of ?10 trillion today.
The Tokyo-based company this month bolstered its war chest for expansion with the Alibaba IPO. SoftBank's stake cost about $20 million 14 years ago and now is valued at roughly $71 billion.
Mr. Son is said to keep a whiteboard in his office with an ever-changing list of possible deals. SoftBank already has investments in more than 1,300 companies.
"Content, media and Internet businesses in the U.S., which they can expand globally, should be the main target for SoftBank," said Satoru Kikuchi, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. Because SoftBank already has network infrastructure, it can "leverage it with content businesses."
In recent months, reports have linked SoftBank to a range of potential targets, including U.S.-based Internet company Yahoo Inc., British mobile operator Vodafone Group PLC, Mexican wireless carrier Grupo Iusacell SA de CV and Line Corp., the Japanese operator of a fast-growing mobile messaging service. SoftBank already owns a stake in Yahoo Japan Corp.
But business associates of Mr. Son say he remains attracted to the growth potential of the U.S. despite the T-Mobile setback. He wants to expand SoftBank's media content, seeing that as a way to expand by giving SoftBank's mobile networks a competitive edge, they say.
To expand digital content, SoftBank in July hired Nikesh Arora, one of the driving forces behind the growth of Google Inc.'s lucrative search advertising business. The discussions between SoftBank and DreamWorks Animation began advancing with his arrival, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Son has met with Mr. Katzenberg, though Mr. Arora has been leading the talks, the person said.
SoftBank last month acquired control of Supercell Oy, a Finland-based mobile-game company that created titles such as "Clash of Clans.'' SoftBank also owns a controlling sake in Japan's GungHo Online Entertainment Inc., the developer of "Puzzle & Dragons." Such investments have made SoftBank the top-grossing provider of mobile-game applications for smartphones world-wide, according to research firm App Annie.
Yet efforts by telecoms and media companies to bring content and distribution under the same roof often have failed to live up to expectations. France's Vivendi SA in 2004 sold control of its Hollywood assets to General Electric Co., only four years after acquiring them. And Japan's Sony Corp. has struggled to reap the benefits of owning electronics and entertainment arms.
Mr. Son's Hollywood dreams recall Japanese deals in the movie industry in the late 1980s by Sony and others.

Box Office: Denzel Washington Powering 'Equalizer' Over 'Boxtrolls'

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Denzel Washington may be the most consistent hitter in Hollywood.               
The Oscar-winning actor steers clear of blockbuster fare and superhero pics, but his name above the title is gold when it comes to bringing in adult crowds to his thrillers and dramas. His latest, "The Equalizer," hits theaters this weekend and should bring in between $28 million and $30 million. Produced by Sony Pictures and Village Roadshow for $55 million, "The Equalizer" will unspool across 3,234 locations. The studio says it will be happy with a debut in the mid-to-high $20 million range.               
"Denzel Washington doesn't miss," said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. "He's one of the last foolproof actors working. He hasn't really had any bombs."               
Indeed, no film starring Washington has opened to less than $20 million since 2003's "Out of Time." Over the course of his career, his films have brought in an impressive $2.1 billion, in addition to a pair of Academy Awards. Washington has gotten there without the benefit of a franchise.               
Sony hopes that's about to change and that the film will spark a new action series. "The Equalizer" reunites the "Training Day" team of Washington and director Antoine Fuqua, which will help stoke audience enthusiasm. The gritty, hard-R thriller is a very loose adaptation of the CBS show about an urbane crime-fighting Brit - it keeps the vigilantism and special ops past and ups the violence. It pits Robert McCall (Washington) against Russian mobsters with a propensity for tattooing and brutality. Come for Washington, stick around to discover creative and violent uses for power drills and corkscrews.               
"The Equalizer" will head off against another wide release aimed at a very different audience, "The Boxtrolls." The stop-motion animated film arrives courtesy of Laika, the Oregon-based creators of "Paranorman" and "Coraline." Focus Features is distributing the films across 3,464 locations in 3D and 2D and should pick up between $15 million and $16 million. The film centers on a young boy raised by trolls and features the voices of Ben Kingsley, Elle Fanning and Tracy Morgan.               
Analysts say there's a cap to the number of tickets this kind of animated feature can sell, noting that films such as "Coraline" or "The Nightmare Before Christmas" are more specialty attractions than broad crowd-pleasers.               
"Fans of stop motion are more cinephiles and that doesn't always translate into really big box office," said Jeff Bock, an analyst at Exhibitor Relations. "Even though there hasn't been a new animated film in the marketplace for two months, there's a limit to the audience that it can reach."               
Last weekend's champ "The Maze Runner" should have a respectable hold on audience attention thanks to positive word-of-mouth. In its sophomore weekend, look for the young adult thriller to possibly top "Boxtrolls" with $16 million. Holdovers "This Is Where I Leave You" and "Walk Among the Tombstones" will likely pull in $6 million in their second weekends of release.               
Among limited releases, CBS Films will roll out the gay and labor rights dramedy "Pride" in six theaters in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.               
Overall, the domestic box office will have a tough time matching the $108 million racked up over the same weekend in 2013, when "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2" bowed to $34 million and "Baggage Claim" and "Don John" also hit theaters. However, analysts say that the range of product coming into theaters is a good sign for a business trying to shake off one of the worst summer box office periods in more than a decade.

GameStop Plans to Increase Holiday Hiring; Videogame Retailer Points to Preparation for New Game Sales

GameStop Corp. plans to hire about 25,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season, an increase of 47% from last year.
The videogame retailer said it plans to hire seasonal "game advisers," 250 consumer electronics technicians for its refurbishment operation center and warehouse personnel for its distribution centers.
Part of the reason for the stepped-up hiring plans includes preparation for new games for Microsoft's Xbox One, the Nintendo Wii U and Sony's PlayStation 4.
GameStop also expects to see demand from consumers who want to trade-in their older smartphones and trade up to Apple's iPhone 6.
The introduction of updated versions of the Xbox and Playstation have bolstered GameStop's results recently.
During August the retailer reported its second-quarter profit nearly doubled thanks to booming demand for the new videogame consoles, which more than doubled GameStop's hardware sales for the period. New games for the consoles drove software sales, which rose nearly 16%.
Retailers typically hire temporary, part-time staff to help handle the higher traffic that occurs during the holidays.
HHGregg Inc. said Thursday that it plans to hire more than 450 sales associates for the holiday season, down from 500 last year.
Toys "R" Us and Target Corp. have both disclosed plans to hire the same number of employees as last year, while Kohl's Corp. plans to hire 67,000 workers, up from 50,000 a year ago.

UPDATE 2-Nanoco, Dow Chemical to launch quantum dot production

* Commercial production expected to start in first half 2015
* Plant to produce cadmium-free quantum dots in South Korea
* Demand from display makers seen rising
* Nanoco shares rise more than 27 pct (Adds details, analyst comment, background; updates shares)
By Aashika Jain and Roshni Menon
Sept 24 (Reuters) - Nanoco Group Plc said commercial production of quantum dots, used to make vibrant screen displays, is expected to begin in the first half of next year at a plant in South Korea being built by its partner, Dow Chemical Co.
Shares of the British nanotechnology company rose more than 27 percent on Wednesday to their highest in more than 10 months.
The launch of quantum dot production, which analysts said was probably linked to a supply agreement with a big display manufacturer, signals a major breakthrough for Nanoco and the quantum dot industry.
"Nanoco is today on the threshold of major growth in its revenues, earnings and cash flows," Liberum analysts Eoin Lambe and Janardan Menon wrote in a note.
Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals, 10,000 times finer than a human hair, that can convert electrical energy into light and be manipulated to produce precise colors for display.
They are cheaper and consume less power than organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), their rival technology at the sharp end of the display business, but cannot yet be produced in the same quantities.
With demand expected to soar, the handful of companies able to make quantum dots are partnering with big display makers to set up industrial-scale manufacturing.
Dow Chemical, which holds exclusive worldwide rights to sell Nanoco's quantum dots for use in electronic displays, said on Wednesday it would begin construction of the manufacturing plant in Cheonan, South Korea.
Unlike those produced by competitors, quantum dots using Nanoco's technology do not contain cadmium, a toxic metal, the use of which is restricted in many countries. Cheonan will be the world's first large-scale, cadmium-free quantum dot plant.
'MILLIONS OF TELEVISIONS'
Quantum dots are already in use. Amazon.com Inc's Kindle Fire HDX 7 and Sony Corp's Triluminos TV, for example, already use them in their screens.
It is their wider adoption in television screens as a much cheaper alternative to OLED technology that promises growth.
Touch Display Research, a market research and consulting firm, forecasts that the global market for quantum dot displays and lighting components will rise to $9.6 billion by 2023 from $508 million in 2014.
Dow Chemical said the new plant would "enable the manufacture of millions of quantum dot televisions and other display applications to meet growing consumer demand."
Analysts at Liberum and Canaccord Genuity said Dow would have been unlikely to build a plant without the commitment of at least one large customer.
Among the largest South Korean display makers, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd declined immediate comment and a spokeswoman for LG Electronics Inc said the company had not decided whether or not to release quantum dot TVs.
For Manchester-based Nanoco, founded in 2001, the start of construction of the plant triggers an unspecified "milestone payment" from Dow. The Liberum and Canaccord analysts estimated this payment at about $2 million.
The Liberum analysts forecast Nanoco's revenue could rise to 51 million pounds ($84 million) by 2017. The company reported revenue of 3.93 million pounds for the year to July 31, 2013. The company has yet to turn a profit since listing in May 2009.
Nanoco's shares were up 25.4 percent at 148.3 pence at 1023 GMT. ($1 = 0.6097 British pound) (Additional reporting by Se Young Lee in Seoul; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Robin Paxton)

New Hollywood Studio Gets a Chinese Engine; Robinov Startup Gets $200 Million From Fosun, Looks to China for Growth

Hollywood studios have spent more than a decade working their way into China past government quotas, censors, and ever-changing regulations. Now one of China's largest conglomerates has found its way into Hollywood through simpler means: an enormous check.
Fosun Group is investing about $200 million in Studio 8, a startup run by former Warner Bros. film chief Jeff Robinov, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The studio's movies will be distributed by Sony Corp.'s Sony Pictures Entertainment,
Fosun had said back in June that it would team up with Studio 8, but the size of the investment wasn't disclosed. The deal marks the largest investment to date by a Chinese company in American film production.
In their first interview discussing the company, Mr. Robinov and Fosun chairman Guo Guangchang declined to discuss the financing of Studio 8. They said they saw their partnership as an opportunity to design an American company while keeping in mind the fast-growing Chinese box office, currently No. 2 in the world and expected to soon become No. 1.
"Hollywood stands at the peak of the global entertainment industry, but everybody should be looking at China for growth in the future," said Mr. Guo before a party on the Sony lot Tuesday night introducing him to Hollywood.
Sony is investing an additional $50 million into Studio 8, which is also finalizing a credit facility of at least $300 million, said the people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Robinov said he intends to make movies at different budget levels aimed at the global market. Studio 8 has a five-year deal that calls for Sony to release 24 of its productions. Its first release will likely hit theaters in 2016.
With Studio 8, Fosun is making one of Hollywood's riskiest bets: Backing a company that will develop a new slate of films with no intellectual property to adapt and no library of older titles to produce stable cash flow. The company's success will rest entirely on its ability to quickly develop and produce movies appealing to world-wide audiences that have flocked to movies like "The Avengers" and the fourth "Transformers," but without having any superhero comics to adapt or prior hits from which it can make sequels.
"Entrepreneurship is always hard, but멞I fully trust the team Jeff has assembled," said Mr. Guo.
Mr. Robinov is respected in Hollywood, particularly for the filmmaker relationships he developed during his 16 year-run as an executive at Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros.
"The kind of global, muscular movies Jeff has been making are the kind of movies we want," said Sony movie chief Amy Pascal, citing several of Mr. Robinov's biggest hits at Warner, including "Inception," "Gravity," and "The Hangover," all of which were original ideas.
"I do have a very solid sense of what can work in the marketplace... and cut through some of the clutter," said Mr. Robinov. "The trick for us is to take movies that are commercial, but somehow feel different."
But others have struggled with the same model Studio 8 is pursuing.
Soon after DreamWorks SKG was relaunched by Steven Spielberg and former Universal Pictures chairman Stacey Snider in 2009, it fell into a financial hole after it released several high-profile flops. It still hasn't found its footing.
Sony, like most studios, is cutting back on internal production. This deal gives it more movies to release through its world-wide distribution and marketing operation, which carries a sizable overhead. Sony will get between 8% and 10% of the revenue generated by Studio 8 movies, according to knowledgeable people, on the low end of what is typical for such arrangements in Hollywood.
Fosun, which has compared itself to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, has insurance assets at its core but has also put money into banking, real estate and mines and recently made an unsuccessful run at Forbes magazine.
Its only other significant entertainment investment is a 21% stake in Bona Film Group, a Chinese distributor. Bona won't necessarily release Studio 8 movies, Mr. Guo said, and Fosun won't necessarily be able to get the pictures into one of China's 34 allotted annual slots for foreign movies that want to receive up to 25% of box office revenue, as opposed to a small flat fee. However, the relationship could provide advantages.
"Because of our support, they will be a big success in China," predicted Mr. Guo.
Chinese companies are aiming to boost their own filmmaking skills. While the country's consumers appear to have a voracious appetite for movies, its domestic productions haven't found global success.
"What better way to learn from Hollywood than to buy into it?" said Matthew Alderson, the head of law firm Harris & Mourre LLC's Chinese media practice.
Investments in movies can also be good branding exercises for Chinese companies looking to expand overseas, said Lora Chen, president at California-based consultancy China Media Consulting.
Chinese entertainment company Huayi Brothers Media Corp., which at one point planned to invest in Studio 8, recently said it would spend $130 million to create a U.S. subsidiary that will produce and distribute movies and television shows.
Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group Corp., which owns U.S. theater chain AMC Entertainment Group, is setting up a base for entertainment investments as part of a $1.2 billion real-estate development in Los Angeles.
Mr. Robinov left Warner last year after he lost a three-way race to become the film and television studio's chief executive and had a falling out with Kevin Tsujihara, who got the job in his stead.
Even before finalizing financial arrangements for Studio 8, he had been looking to re-establish his position as one of Hollywood's premier moguls.
"Jeff has been meeting with a bunch of agents, producers and talent to say, 'I'm in business and want to be the patriarch of your movies,'" said one talent agent.

'Godzilla' Beats 'Fault in Our Stars' in DVD Sales

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The flood of high-profile new releases continues, with new Blu-ray Discs and DVDs accounting for seven of the top 10 sellers on Nielsen VideoScan's weekly overall disc sales chart for the week ending Sept. 21.               
At the top: Warner's "Godzilla" remake-of-a-remake-of-a-remake, which easily debuted at No. 1 on both the First Alert chart, which tracks combined Blu-ray Disc and DVD sales, and Nielsen's dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart.               
The summer theatrical blockbuster grossed more than $200 million in U.S. theaters, nearly 50% more than Sony Pictures' 1998 retelling of the classic horror story of a giant dinosaur wreaking havoc on modern civilization.               
Coming in at No. 2, also on both charts, was 20th Century Fox's "The Fault in Our Stars," a romantic drama that earned $124.8 million in theaters. The film, which boasts a cast of young stars familiar to teens through movies like "Divergent," sold 82.8% as many units as "Godzilla" its first week in stores, according to Nielsen data. Looking at Blu-ray Disc sales only, "Fault" sold just 56% as many units, which isn't surprising given that "Godzilla" generated 58% of its total sales from the high-definition version, to just 39% for "Fault."               
Walt Disney Studios' "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," which debuted at No. 1 the previous week, slipped to No. 3 on both charts, followed by two more high-ranking newcomers: season seven of the hot TV series "The Big Bang Theory," from Warner, which bowed at No. 4, and the Sony Pictures comedy "Think Like a Man Too," a sequel with a domestic box office gross of $65.2 million, entering the chart at No.5.               
On the overall disc chart, "Barbie and the Secret Door," Universal Studios' latest direct-to-video movie starring the iconic Mattel doll, debuted at No. 6, followed by Walt Disney's "Frozen" at No. 7, the same position it held the prior week.               
Rounding out the First Alert top 10 were the 20th Century Fox crime drama "Brick Mansions" at No. 8, down from its No. 2 debut the previous week, and two more new releases: "Castle: The Complete Sixth Season," from Walt Disney Studios, at No. 9, and "Arrow: The Complete Second Season," from Warner, at No. 10.               
On Home Media Magazine's rental chart for the week, "Think Like a Man Too" was the highest-ranking new release, debuting at No. 2. Sony Pictures is one of three major studios that distributes its new releases immediately to all retailers, including Netflix and Redbox, instead of waiting 28 days as the other three majors do.               
"Captain America: The Winter Soldier" soared up to No. 1 after debuting at No. 7 the previous week.               
Lionsgate's "Draft Day" slipped to No. 3 from No. 2, while the previous week's top rental, 20th Century Fox's "The Other Woman," slid to No. 4. Rounding out the top five was "Moms' Night Out," from Sony Pictures, down a notch from No. 4 the prior week.

Sept 24 (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group is investing $200 million in U.S. media company Studio 8, a startup led by former Warner Bros executive Jeff Robinov, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The deal marks the biggest investment to date by a Chinese company in U.S. film production, the Journal wrote. (http://on.wsj.com/1rkdWlO)
Fosun said in June that it would partner with Studio 8, but the size of the investment was not disclosed, the Journal said.
Studio 8 has a five-year tie-up with Sony Corp's Sony Pictures Entertainment to distribute 24 of its movies, the first of which is likely to hit cinemas by 2016, the report added.
Sony is investing $50 million in Studio 8. The U.S. studio is also finalizing a credit facility of at least $300 million, the Journal cited its sources as saying.

Microsoft Xbox One set to launch in China on September 29

BEIJING (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has set Sept. 29 as the new launch date for its Xbox One game console in China, the U.S. software giant said on Tuesday, in the first launch since a 14-year ban on sales of foreign games consoles was lifted this year.
The world's biggest software company gave no reason for the delay in the launch which was originally scheduled for Sept. 23.
The delay is the latest in a series of setbacks for Microsoft in China, where it is under investigation for suspected anti-trust violations related to the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office.
"We take great care to ensure that we meet or exceed regulatory standards," said Microsoft in an e-mail to Reuters in response to the delayed console launch.
The Xbox One console will cost 3,699 yuan ($602.76) without the Kinect motion detection system and 4,299 yuan ($700.53) with Kinect, Microsoft said.
China is the world's third-biggest gaming market where revenues grew by more than a third from 2012 to nearly $14 billion last year.
Console games must also get approval from Shanghai's local culture department, which will ensure they do not harm China's national unity, territorial integrity or reputation - or promote racial hatred, obscenity, gambling, violence or drugs. This could stop some of video games' biggest franchises, such as Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty, from being published in China.
"After receiving government approval for the first wave of games, we've decided to launch with digital copies of the first 10 games now and will continue our work to bring more blockbuster games and a broad offering of entertainment and app experiences to the platform in the months to come," Enwei Xie, Microsoft's general manager for Xbox China, said in a press release.
In May, Sony Corp) said it would set up a joint venture with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group to bring the PlayStation games console to China.
Microsoft makes the Xbox One console with Chinese internet TV set-top box maker BesTV New Media Co Ltd.

(Reuters) - Sony Corp said PlayStation TV set-top box, which allows users to access movies and TV episodes from the PlayStation store, will hit stores in the United States and Canada on Oct. 14.
The price for a standalone PlayStation TV (PS TV) is $99.99, the company wrote in a blog. For $139.99, customers can get a wireless controller, an 8 GB memory card and "The Lego Movie" videogame along with the PS TV.
Around 700 games will be available to PS TV users, including "Metal Gear Solid" and the franchise "Killzone: Mercenary".
PS TV was released in Japan and other Asian countries under the name "PlayStation Vita TV" last fall. Sony is trying to expand its entertainment network services to compete against players like Amazon.com Inc.
Sony did not say when it will launch its online TV service.
The company signed a deal earlier this month to carry 22 Viacom Inc channels, including Comedy Central and MTV, on its planned online TV.
PlayStation boss Shaun Layden told tech blog Re/code in June the company was "on track" to unveil its product some time this year.
Sony's web TV service will join the ranks of an already crowded market with devices from Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Roku.

MGM Buys 55% of Mark Burnett Ventures; Reality-Show Producer Sought Partner to Fuel Growth

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. acquired a 55% stake in "Survivor" producer Mark Burnett's various television and film production ventures, folding them into its storied but dormant United Artists banner.
The studio behind "The Hobbit," the James Bond series and "RoboCop," paid about $400 million for the assets, said people familiar with the matter. MGM is controlled by a group of hedge funds led by Anchorage Capital Group LLC.
The deal's structure is complex. MGM is investing in both One Three Media, a joint venture between Mr. Burnett and Hearst Corp. that produced unscripted shows like "The Voice," and LightWorkers Media, Mr. Burnett's venture with his wife, Roma Downey, which has produced scripted fare like "The Bible."
Mr. Burnett, a British-American producer, is widely credited with popularizing the reality-television genre with "Survivor" well over a decade ago and remains one of the most prolific producers on TV. As part of the transaction, MGM is also acquiring interests in unscripted shows Mr. Burnett produced, such as "Survivor," "Shark Tank," and "The Apprentice."
The investment caps several months of talks between Mr. Burnett's businesses and Hollywood studios, as the producer hunted for more money to fuel the growth of his television empire. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Mr. Burnett was looking to sell a stake in One Three Media, three years after he formed his 50-50 joint venture with Hearst.
"This started with Mark calling me with this idea that we ought to be open to멪and to look for멪a partner who could help us grow faster, get us into new formats, get us into new markets, new countries and new ideas," Steven Swartz, Hearst's CEO, said in an interview.
MGM's investment comes as studios are increasingly betting on television for growth to offset their slower growing, lower-margin movie business. Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures launched a television division last year, while Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton has said he is putting more emphasis on his company's television business than movies.
The new United Artists Media Group will make content across all platforms, including scripted and non-scripted television programs, movies and digital content, with Mr. Burnett serving as CEO.
The venture will also launch a streaming online video channel aimed at religious audiences featuring Christian music videos, sermons from religious leaders and short user-generated religious videos.
"We think they are unparalleled in this arena," said Gary Barber, MGM's chief executive.
Launched in 1919 by Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith, United Artists has been though a number of incarnations, particularly since it was acquired by MGM in the early 1980s. Most recently, a prior management team in 2006 gave Tom Cruise and his production partner Paula Wagner a 30% stake in UA and control of the division.
But the duo released only two films, the flop "Lions for Lambs" and modest success "Valkyrie," before departing. After MGM emerged from bankruptcy in late 2010, it bought back full control of United Artists, but has done nothing with the brand until now.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dystopian young adult movie "The Maze Runner" won the weekend box office race in the United States and Canada, collecting $32.5 million in ticket sales to outpace the Liam Neeson action flick, "A Walk Among the Tombstones."
Neeson's film earned $13.1 million from Friday through Sunday and finished in second place, according to estimates from tracking firm Rentrak. Comedy "This is Where I Leave You" landed in the No. 3 slot with $11.9 million at domestic theaters.
"Maze Runner" fell slightly short projections for a start of $34 million, the forecast of Box Office Mojo.
The movie stars MTV "Teen Wolf" heartthrob Dylan O'Brien as one of a group of boys living in an isolated paradise where they are trapped by a giant, moving concrete maze. The movie, based on the first novel in a series written by James Dashner, is an attempt to capture the young adult audience that has propelled blockbusters like "The Hunger Games" and "Twilight."
"Maze Runner" opened overseas on Sept. 11, and global sales through Sunday totaled $81.5 million, distributor 20th Century Fox said. The film cost $30 million to make.
Chris Aronson, 20th Century Fox's president of domestic distribution, declared the film "a bona fide home run."
"When you give audiences a film that they want and they like, it's going to do well," said Aronson.
He confirmed that a sequel is in the works. "The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials" is set to open in September of 2015.
In "Walk Among the Tombstones," Neeson plays a private investigator hired by a drug kingpin to find out who murdered his wife. Neeson has earned success as an action star in recent hits "Non-Stop" and "Taken 2." "Tombstones" cost $28 million to make, according to Box Office Mojo.
"This is Where I Leave You," produced for about $20 million, features Tina Fey and Jason Bateman in the story of four grown siblings forced to live together for a week after their father dies.
Last weekend's winner, home invasion thriller "No Good Deed," fell to fourth place, grossing $10.2 million and bringing its total to $40.1 million. Family film "Dolphin Tale 2" took the No. 5 slot with $9 million in its second weekend.
"The Maze Runner" was released by 20th Century Fox, a unit of 21st Century Fox. "Walk Among the Tombstones" was distributed in the United States by Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast Corp and in Canada by Entertainment One Group. "This is Where I Leave You" and "Dolphin Tale 2" were released by Warner Bros, a unit of Time Warner Inc.
Sony Corp's movie studio released "No Good Deed."

Why Taylor Swift and One Direction Play for Peanuts; At iHeartRadio Festival This Weekend, Artists Look to Promote New Songs

The iHeartRadio Music Festival is expected to draw at least 20,000 fans to Las Vegas this weekend, and millions of viewers when it is streamed online and later broadcast on TV멪but it won't be much of a payday for the headliners, including Taylor Swift and One Direction.
That's because most artists are willing to perform for next to nothing. They choose to forgo a big paycheck in exchange for a media blitz, hoping that the radio giant that runs the festival, iHeartMedia Inc.멪known until this week as Clear Channel멪will keep playing their songs on its 800-plus stations.
DJ Steve Aoki canceled three European shows, giving up about $500,000, in order to perform his song "Born to Get Wild" with the artist Will.i.am at the festival, according to a person familiar with the matter. IHeartMedia is paying Mr. Aoki a small fee to help with his expenses, but the amount doesn't come close to covering his travel costs, this person said.
Nearly a decade after the major record companies settled charges that they violated federal payola laws멪which forbid radio stations from playing songs in exchange for payment without disclosing the arrangement on the airwaves멪another, legal method has largely replaced yesterday's pay-for-airplay schemes. One veteran promoter calls it "showola."
Artists have long played for peanuts at radio stations' holiday shows and summer jams to promote their records. But these cut-rate appearances have now become the main currency that record labels and promoters use to convince radio programmers to play their songs. That is, in part, because they have little else of value to offer, as the music industry's promotion budgets have shriveled.
The appearances themselves are becoming more valuable too, as the concert business booms. For example, Ms. Swift grossed an average of $2.2 million per show over the past 36 months, while boy band One Direction grossed an average of $2.6 million, according to Pollstar.
Radio broadcasters, meantime, are becoming increasingly dependent on the extra exposure and income from their live멪and now often televised멪events, as radio listeners are increasingly distracted by everything from mobile games to social media, tuning into radio for shorter blocks of time.
In accordance with federal law, iHeartMedia doesn't promise artists or labels airplay in exchange for their appearances. But artists and record labels fear a drop in airtime if they don't agree to perform, managers and label executives say. Artist managers say that they can typically make excuses to get a client out of an obligation with a broadcaster or station once or twice, but declining a third time means risking the possibility that the broadcaster might "bury" the artist's next single in overnight airplay, one manager said.
Many artists and their labels, though, fight for the chance to appear in such shows at a discount while promoting new songs멪especially new televised shows such as the iHeartRadio Music Awards, which drew more than five million viewers for its debut in May.
The televised events offer national exposure that further augments the record and ticket sales generated by that radio play. IHeartMedia has broadcast its holiday Jingle Ball and summer Pool Party events on the CW Network; it plans to televise its second annual country music festival next year as well.
IHeartMedia typically offers to pay for artists' travel expenses to its events, but even that sum is usually a negotiation. iHeartMedia this year offered one headlining act $150,000 to get to the iHeartRadio festival, for example, but the act required double that sum to cover its costs, according to a person familiar with the matter. In the end, the act had its record label negotiate with iHeartMedia so that the label could kick in some of the difference, this person said.
To increase their leverage in the showola economy, some independent radio promoters have started managing artists on the side, so that they can broker performance deals directly with radio stations. Los Angeles magazine Hits, for example, which has a radio promotion arm, currently manages acts including Pentatonix, Airborne Toxic Event and Walk off the Earth. By offering radio stations performances by those artists, Hits can increase its pull when promoting other artists' records to those stations.
Even amid declining music sales, radio has remained a key way for musicians to amass fans, sell concert tickets and merchandise and build brands that help them land marketing deals and corporate sponsors. In the U.S., radio broadcasters have never paid royalties to most performers on airplay, due to a quirk in copyright law, but they did pay hundreds of millions in royalties last year to music publishers and the artists who wrote the songs. IHeartMedia also pays both performers and songwriters digital royalties to play their music on its Internet service, iHeartRadio.
Until recently, electronic music artists were generally unconcerned with making radio-friendly songs, since their main source of income had always been live gigs. But now most of the world's top DJs have started adding catchy melodies and words over their dance beats to get radio play, competing with each other for exposure to drive their live businesses.
Calvin Harris frequently performs or appears at radio events to promote his music, and his competitors are being forced to follow suit, electronic-music artist managers said. A representative for Mr. Harris didn't respond to a request for comment.
Showola illustrates how the new rules governing radio promotion have helped the biggest record companies save money, but haven't diminished their control over the airwaves. The three major labels, Vivendi A's Univeral Music Group, Sony Corp.'s Sony Music Entertainment and Access Industries' Warner Music Group, together distributed all but one of the top 40 singles this week.
About a decade ago, all three companies settled lawsuits brought by New York's then-attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who alleged that they participated in pay-to-play schemes. As part of the settlements, the labels each agreed to install a compliance officer that would vet all promotion expenses and make sure both staff and contractors adhered to a litany of new rules while wining and dining radio employees.
But these labels have retained their leverage with radio, in part because they control the bulk of the acts that headline radio's shows and can help foot their appearance costs.
"You could make a case that things were much better in days of payola," said one artist manager. "Anybody could get on the radio for couple hundred bucks."

Denzel Washington: Not Thinking About Playing Barack Obama

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - At Spain's 62nd San Sebastian to accept a career-achievement Donostia Award and present, alongside Antoine Fuqua, Sony Pictures' fest opener, "The Equalizer," Denzel Washington denied any idea of playing President Barack Obama.
"Barack Obama is a story that hasn't finished yet. It's not something I'm thinking about, and he's busy. said Washinton, dressed casually in a dark grey jacket and looking very young for his 59 years.
"I've played Biko, Malcolm X, I can't play everybody," he added, when asked if he'd like to limn Martin Luther King.
But Washington did set something of a roadmap of future plans. He will not topline "Shovel Ready," a Warner Bros. adaptation of a debut novel by journalist Adam Sterbergh., he said Friday at a San Sebastian press conference.
It's too early to call, he argued when asked by Variety, if he would star in "The Equalizer" sequel. Sony Pictures and Escape Artists are reportedly working on the project. Screenplay is by Richard Wenk, who penned the first Fuqua/Washington "The Equalizer."
"People will decide if I do a 'The Equalizer' sequel, not me," Washington said. "If it's a good script, it's something I'll consider, but I'm not considering it right now, because this one hasn't come out yet," he added.
But Washington and Fuqua are saddling up - literally, in the actor'scase - for a Western, a remake set up at MGM of "The Magnificent Seven." Washington will be taking riding classes from next week, he said. He was quick to point out to Variety, however, that "The Magnificent Seven" in inspired by Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai." and the film Fuqua and he would be channeling more is the Japanese original. "The Magnificent Seven" is a go project, said Fuqua, who is reportedly attached to "Southpaw" at The Weinstein Company." "Seven Samurai" is one of his favorite movies of all time, Fuqua told the Spanish press.
With such a Hollywood heavyweight as Denzel Washington on board, and Fuqua directing, MGM should have no trouble in completing the cast for "The Magnificent Seven." It would mark the third teaming of Washington and Fuqua after their "Training Day," which earned the U.S. actor his second Academy Award after a supporting actor nod for Edward Zwick's "Glory" and his first best actor Oscar.
Sony Pictures' big-screen redo of the '80s hit TV show, with Washington playing McCall, a hero who helps the hopelessly helpless, "The Equalizer" had its European premiere at San Sebastian, where it was respected by most, rather than drawing rapturous applause.
Undeniable, however, is the ability of Fuqua and Washington to work action scenes. The first, after the film's first half hour build, where Washington demonstrates that the corkscrew is a multi-use appliance, which if applied to the lower jaw of a Russian mobster could emerge in his mouth, sparked applause in the audience at San Sebastian press screening.
What the Donostia Award/"The Equalizer" demonstrated very well is the remarkable pulling power and range of Washington, even at a press conference, an actor who moves from straight seriousness to gentle mockery, clowning, confessions, humility and sincerity, all in the space of a few seconds.
Has he taken up Sidney Poitier's mantle? "There is only one Sidney Poitier, and I'm glad to say he's a friend of mine," Washington retorted.
Does he thing Spanish cinema has improved of late? "I'll let Antoine answer. He knows more about movies than I do. But I have a question: what happened to the Spanish basketball team?
Packing a few phrases of Spanish - "Lo siento mucho" - always a winner with Spain's press, Washington soon had San Sebastian press in his pocket.
Among confessions: Theater. "My children are older now so now I've gone back to doing theater, which was my first love. It's where I was trained and where I started my career. So I've played Shakespeare, Julius Caesar, I just finished a play this summer, 'A Raisin in the Sun.' I've also directed two films and directed half a dozen. So I'm moving around more, directing, acting, producing deals, etc. So I'm trying to do a variety of things."
Washington added he was "working to produce but not looking to act in television," saying he is currently developing a play-based TV series, with a broadcaster, though it was too early to go into details. The theater also had a larger number of good roles than cinema, he added.

 Sony  hopes for PlayStation profit boost as smartphones struggle

TOKYO (Reuters) - The head of Sony Corp's PlayStation division hopes to raise its profit outlook for this year, in stark contrast to the Japanese electronics firm's mobile business which has forecast deep losses and sent Sony's stock reeling.
With Sony's three core electronics businesses - the third is imaging - looking increasingly lopsided, the company is having to shrink and restructure in mobile, and focus its growth hopes on image sensors and the 20-year-old PlayStation games console.
Buoyed by strong sales of the latest PlayStation 4 and the rollout of games and content for its network services, Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Andrew House hopes he can again raise the division's profit forecast for the year to end-March. Sony pushed up that forecast in July to 25 billion yen ($230 million) from 20 billion yen.
"We raised our profit prediction and I hope that's a trend we can continue, even within this fiscal year," House told Reuters in an interview on Thursday, adding his unit's profits looked certain to increase next year from this year's levels.
Sony has sold 10.3 million PlayStation 4 consoles as of Sept. 6, almost double the sales of Microsoft Corp's XBox One, and well ahead of the 7.2 million WiiU's sold by Nintendo Co Ltd, according to market research firm VGChartz.
House's upbeat comments came a day after Sony's struggling smartphone division announced a 180 billion yen impairment charge, triggering the company's sixth profit warning in two-and-a-half years. It also said it would not pay a dividend this year - the first such move since its 1958 listing.
SHARES ROCKED
While Sony had warned in July of a potential charge, the axing of the dividend stunned investors and sparked an 8.6 percent drop in Sony shares to 1,940 yen. That ended a 25 percent rally in the share price over the past six weeks as confidence grew in Sony's restructuring plans and its prospects in growth markets such as automotive sensors.
Sony will cut another 1,000 jobs, around 15 percent of its headcount, in its smartphone business, where it's up against fast-growing Chinese manufacturers such as Xiaomi Inc as well as established names such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.
"If the company were to go through further restructuring, it needs cash, so from this perspective it makes sense that the company's not paying dividends," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management.
Sony's move also sparked a surge in the price of insuring its debt against default, with its 5-year credit default swaps rising 40 percent compared with levels prior to the profit warning.
And Standard & Poor's, the only leading credit ratings agency to retain an investment-grade rating on Sony debt, put the company's credit on review for a possible downgrade to junk status. "We believe it will not be easy for Sony to maintain brand recognition and generate stable profitability in this competitive market," S&P said of Sony's smartphone business.
NETWORK SPENDING
The mobile unit's woes will mean greater scrutiny of the PlayStation's profit performance, which has typically been erratic - swerving from steep losses as Sony spent heavily to develop new consoles to strong profits when those consoles reached peak popularity.
Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai - House's predecessor - has said he hopes the PlayStation 4 can recapture the profit levels of the PlayStation 2, the best-selling game console which at its peak earned Sony more than $1 billion in annual operating profit.
While House declined to be drawn on specific numbers, he touted bright profit prospects at the game division, which brings in 10-12 percent of Sony's revenue, and aims to boost monthly revenue per user from services such as online games, which offer a steadier stream of income than one-off purchases of hardware and software.
"I do feel we have a higher opportunity to build a higher ARPU (average revenue per user) than with the PS3, and that should make a very strong profit contribution over the life-cycle," he said.
He warned, however, that profitability of the game division, which had been combined with network services such as streaming video and music as well as games, would be constrained in the near term as Sony needs to invest in its network infrastructure over the next 12-18 months.
He denied there was pressure for the games division to take up the slack for the mobile business, and noted that both Hirai and CFO Kenichiro Yoshida's background in games and networking was favorable for his business.
"Kaz obviously comes out of the games business. He was in that for 10 years in the States and has a deep understanding of what a healthy ecosystem looks like and what we have to do," said House, a 49-year-old Briton who has worked at Sony for more than two decades. "I think Yoshida coming in as CFO has been hugely beneficial for us. He comes from a network services business."
House said Sony's cloud-based TV service, due to launch in the United States this year, was an opportunity to expand the user base of its network services, now at 52 million - a fraction of Apple's 800 million or so iTunes users. Sony is also looking for more content providers after signing a deal with Viacom to stream 22 of its channels.
For some analysts, the contrasting fortunes of Sony's business pillars was not necessarily a bad thing.
"This has shown that a sensible CFO is able to control the expansionary aspirations of business heads, which if unchecked, would lead to larger losses for Sony," said Atul Goyal, analyst at Jefferies.

TOKYO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Sony Corp's game division head said he hopes the unit can raise its profit outlook for a second time this financial year as sales of the latest PlayStation console and subscription services for games and other content far exceed expectations.
Andrew House, chief executive officer of Sony Computer Entertainment, also told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that he was certain the game division would further increase its operating profit next year.
The division raised its operating profit outlook for the current year to next March to 25 billion yen ($230 million) from 20 billion when it last reported earnings in July.
Sony had sold more than 10 million PlayStation 4 game consoles as of Aug. 13.
House also said that Sony's cloud-based TV service, due to be launched in the United States before the end of the year, was an opportunity to expand the user base of its network services, now at 52 million, and that the firm was looking for more content providers after inking a deal with Viacom last week to stream 22 of its channels.

 Sony  Plans to Turn Game Division into Hub;  Sony  to Develop Service to Stream Games onto Phones, Tablets, Other Devices

CHIBA, Japan멪Faced with deep losses in its electronics business that caused its stock to plunge Thursday, Sony Corp. is stepping up efforts to turn its better-performing game division into a hub for entertainment services.
Andrew House, chief executive of the game unit, said in an interview Thursday that his unit was talking with a range of potential content partners for a planned Internet television service that Sony intends to introduce in the U.S. by the end of the year. Sony last week disclosed details of one such agreement with Viacom Inc., under which it will be able to stream more than 20 channels, including MTV and Nickelodeon.
Mr. House said Sony also intended to develop a service to stream videogames onto smartphones, tablets and other devices from a range of manufacturers other than Sony.
"A streaming-based approach needs to have a very wide funnel of devices, and that inherently means a broad- and manufacturer-agnostic approach," said Mr. House, who was attending the Tokyo Game Show in this Tokyo suburb.
Since its introduction in November last year, Sony's $399 PlayStation 4 console is selling at the fastest pace on record for any Sony game console. After nine months, it sold 10 million units, far ahead of rivals from Microsoft Corp. and Nintendo Co.
"Sony has the potential to make the game console market its exclusive territory," said Eiichi Katayama, an analyst at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
The growing ambitions for the game division mark a contrast with the electronics business, long the core of Sony but which has had various problems in recent years.
On Wednesday, Sony said it expected a ?230 billion ($2.12 billion) loss in the current fiscal year, driven mainly by a big write-down in its smartphone division where sales fell short of expectations. The disclosure, which came after the market close, pushed Sony shares down 8.6% in Tokyo trading Thursday.
Yasuo Nakane, an analyst at Deutsche Securities, described the move as an "extremely negative surprise," saying additional cuts might be needed. "We think the shape, scale and organizational structure of the (Sony headquarters) and sales company should be revised from scratch based on a downsizing of its core businesses," he wrote in a note to investors.
Sony surprised analysts in July when it reported a modest net profit for the April-June quarter, helped by its game unit's swing into the black. Its smartphone division posted a loss. Sony's Hollywood studio business and its finance arm have also been profit contributors recently.
Analysts say the PlayStation 4 makes it easy for third-party developers to create game software, meaning consumers have a good selection of titles. Sony this week made software to make game titles free of charge for the third-party developers to encourage further games.
At the four-day videogame trade show in the Makuhari Messe convention center outside Tokyo, attention focused on Sony's virtual reality headset, called Morpheus, which the company has been developing since 2011.
Like other such headsets, the Morpheus allows users to feel they are surrounded by the game environment. It also comes with a three-dimensional sound system, making sounds come from above, below and behind. And sensors on the hand-held controller give users the sensation of reaching out in various directions so that they can, say, feed a dinosaur in front of them.
The headset is initially aimed at heavy gamers, but Shuhei Yoshida, who is in charge of the project, said he hoped it would deliver "whole new experiences" for nongamers. He offered the example of a music lover who could don the headset to attend a virtual concert.
While Mr. House of the game unit said there had been no change in strategy for the division since the smartphone woes came to light, he acknowledged pressure to deliver results.
"As one of Sony's senior managers, I take very seriously the overall health of the company," Mr. House said. "My goal is to be absolutely focused on driving a very strong and profit-contributing and healthy ecosystem that can benefit Sony overall."
Sony hopes to leverage its game software to prop up its struggling smartphones. At a recent trade show in Berlin, Sony said its latest smartphone, the Xperia Z3, would come with a feature allowing users to play PlayStation 4 games remotely on the smartphone, if connected to Wi-Fi.
Mr. Katayama, the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch analyst, was cautious about how far the PlayStation 4 could reverse Sony's fortunes. "Games will no doubt be another source of stable earnings, but for a company with such diversified income streams as Sony, it would be wrong to portray games as a business that could support the company alone," he said.

Sept 19 (Reuters) - Following is a table highlighting this financial

    The yen is currently trading at around 109 to the dollar, much weaker
than most companies had anticipated. The Japanese currency's rapid descent
to six-year lows against the greenback is starting to push beyond comfort
zones for three quarters of Japanese firms, a Reuters poll showed,

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT
U.S. stocks rose, with the Dow industrials and S&P 500 hitting all-time highs, on relief over the latest Fed statement. The British pound hit a two-week high against the dollar ahead of the Scottish independence vote results. Treasurys finished mostly lower and the dollar hit a six-year high against the yen on worries over higher U.S. interest rates. Rate fears also caused gold futures to extend losses. Oil prices fell on the dollar's strength and as ample supplies weighed.
OPENING CALL
Big changes are afoot for the index that underlies the $5.9 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF. At the close of trading Friday, the ETF will transition to an index of 50 Hong-Kong listed stocks from 25. Rebecca Cheong, head of Americas equity derivatives strategy at UBS breaks down the differences, which are major. Financials' weighting in the index will fall by 9.4%, while consumer discretionary, utilities and industrials will roughly make up the difference, she says.
EQUITIES
The Dow industrials and S&P 500 rallied to all-time highs as investors were heartened by signals from the Federal Reserve that it remains on a measured course to eventually raise interest rates.
"If the pace of inflation remains contained, it is likely that the Fed will increase rates in a slow and methodical manner, which in our view presents a favorable backdrop for equities," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. An improving economy should lead to earnings growth and further stock gains this year, he said.
Financial stocks led the S&P 500 higher, with the sector posting a 1.1% gain.
"There's a relief rally here," said Steven Rosen, head of single-stock and ETF volatility trading at Soci?t? G?n?rale.
Investors also parsed mixed economic reports. Jobless claims fell by 36,000 to 280,000 in the week ended Sept. 13, well below the 305,000 level of claims expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The decline in claims marked the biggest drop in nearly two years.
Meanwhile, U.S. home construction dropped sharply in August. Housing starts fell 14.4% from July to an annual rate of 956,000 units, missing expectations for a 5.5% decline. Building permits also logged a bigger-than-expected decline, falling 5.6% in August.
Investors are also looking ahead to Alibaba Group Holding's initial public offering on Friday. Early investors will be able to sell more than $8 billion of shares, which is affecting how the offering is being priced.
In other corporate news, Rite Aid reported better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter, but lowered its outlook for the full year. Shares dropped nearly 19%.
ConAgra Foods shares rose 4.6% after the food company's adjusted per-share earnings beat expectations.
In Asian trading Thursday, stocks rose to an eight-month high in Tokyo but retreated in Hong Kong, with the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates and a weak Chinese property market in focus.
FOREX
The pound climbed to a two-week high against the dollar, as Scots headed to the polls to vote on separating from the U.K.
Most pre-election polls showed the pro-U.K. campaign narrowly in the lead despite a late surge by pro-independence voters last weekend. Most investors believe a vote against independence would benefit the pound. Although the currency fell by more than 6% from its July highs as the momentum for a referendum gathered, the U.K. economy has surged this year and investors expect the Bank of England to increase rates in 2015.
"The market is getting increasingly aggressive in the belief that we see a 'No' vote tonight," said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank, in a note to investors.
Meanwhile, the dollar rose to a new six-year high against the yen as investors continued to pile into the U.S. currency on expectations that the Federal Reserve is moving closer to raising interest rates.
BONDS
Yields on shorter-dated U.S. government bonds climbed to the highest levels in more than three years as worries over higher interest rates drove investors to cut holdings for a second day.
"The Federal Reserve is removing the punchbowl and it is time to be defensive" in your bond portfolio, said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Fla., which manages $2.25 billion in assets. "The bond market needs to adjust, which means higher yields."
Higher interest rates make newly sold bonds more attractive to buy, causing the value of existing bond prices to fall.
The bond market's selling over the past session has been led by shorter-dated notes. These yields have risen at a faster pace compared with longer-dated bonds since Fed officials on Wednesday afternoon forecast official rates to be at a higher level for the next two years compared with their projections in June.
Upbeat labor-market data added to anxiety. Initial claims for unemployment benefits posted the largest drop in nearly two years, a sign improvement in the labor market gained traction.
COMMODITIES
Oil futures fell as a strong dollar and higher U.S. supplies weighed on prices.
"The U.S. dollar seems to be the theme of the day," said Tim Evans, an analyst at Citi Futures Perspective. He summarized the market sentiment as: "Sell every commodity that you own, because the U.S. dollar strength is here to stay."
Gold prices extended their losses on as expectations of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve prompted some investors to cut back holdings of the store of value.
"While there is no definitive calendar date for an interest-rate rise, there was a clear statement to normalize policy," traders at TD Securities said in a note to clients.

Toshiba Accelerates PC Business Restructuring; Firm's PC Operations to Focus on Business-to-Business Field

TOKYO멪Toshiba Corp. on Thursday said it would accelerate the restructuring of its PC business to focus on the business-to-business field and would withdraw from certain consumer markets.
Hoping to reap the fruits of five years of cost-cutting this year, the Japanese company said it would reduce the size of its global workforce in the PC business by about 900 workers, which is 20% of its PC operations head count, excluding the manufacturing segment.
It will also cut fixed costs by more than ?20 billion versus the previous fiscal year ended in March and reduce the number of sales bases around the world to 13 in the current fiscal year from 32. The company didn't specify which consumer markets it would withdraw from.
Noting that its PC business reported positive operating income in the first quarter of this fiscal year, Toshiba said the cost of structural reforms would subtract ?45 billion ($415.24 million) from its operating profit and remove ?36 billion from its net profit. The company currently projects a ?330 billion operating profit and a ?120 billion net profit for this fiscal year.
"The PC market is expected to see a continuing trend to modest growth rates, and these transformation measures are necessary to support the business in securing consistent profit," Toshiba said in a statement.
Major Japanese electronics makers have undergone structural reforms in recent years to reorganize unprofitable businesses and to increase their global competitiveness. In July, Toshiba already announced a restructuring of its visual products business to focus more on Japan and rapidly growing emerging nations.
On Wednesday, Sony Corp. said that it expected its net loss for this fiscal year to balloon to ?230 billion as a result of an impairment charge connected to smartphones and acknowledged it wouldn't be a major player in the devices, which had been one of the company's last hopes for turning around its electronics arm.

 Sony  Shares Plunge After Earnings Warning;  Sony 's Share Price Fell Nearly 10% in Tokyo Morning Trading

TOKYO멪Sony Corp.'s share price plunged on Thursday after the company's said that it would post a loss of more than $2 billion in the current fiscal year and stop paying dividends.
The company's stock fell more than 10% at one point in the morning session on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dropping as low as ?1,844. Its shares ended down 8.6% at ?1,940.
The Japanese electronics giant announced after the market closed on Wednesday that it would take an impairment charge of ?180 billion connected to smartphones in the second quarter and acknowledged it wouldn't be a major player in the devices, which had been one of the company's last hopes for turning around its electronics arm.
As a result of the charge, Sony said it expected to post a net loss of ?230 billion in the fiscal year ending in March, almost five times what it forecast four months ago.
"The company had mentioned the possibility of impairment losses when it announced its April-June results, but its decision to book the losses at the top of the expected range is somewhat negative," said Yu Okazaki, an analyst at Nomura Securities.
Also hurting Sony shares on Thursday was the company's decision not to pay a dividend in the current fiscal year for the first time since the company's stock was listed in 1958.
The announcement was an "extremely negative surprise," said Yasuo Nakane, a research analyst for Deutsche Securities Inc. It will "weigh on the share price" in the near term, he said.
JPMorgan Securities' analysts also point out the move to skip dividend payouts may be highlighting worse-than-expected financial conditions.
"It is well known that dividends are a long-term commitment and we think this signals that its internal operations may be worse than what the market thinks," they said in a research note.
Meanwhile, the cost of credit protection for Sony increased to 165 basis points on Thursday, up sharply from around 110 basis points on Tuesday. Some market participants expect Sony's credit default swap price to remain high for the next few months while major credit-rating firms review the company's credit rating.
On Wednesday, Japan Credit Rating Agency said it placed Sony's credit rating under negative watch. Fitch Ratings said the write-down came as "no surprise" and wasn't likely to affect its rating.
Moody's has already assigned a junk rating to Sony's bonds, while Standard & Poor's on Thursday said it placed Sony's BBB- rating on credit monitor with negative implications.
Looking forward, analysts expect the company to need more structural changes.
"We think the shape, scale and organizational structure of the HQ and sales company should be revised from scratch based on a downsizing of its core businesses," Deutsche's Mr. Nakane said, adding that the company needs a slim business structure even if it incurs huge additional costs.
JPMorgan also warns specifically about the competitive smartphone business.
"Despite a write-down in the mobile communication segment, we do not rule out potential downside risk to its smartphone operations given commoditized high-end smartphones and intensifying competition in the mid-end segment," the brokerage's analysts said.
Corrections & Amplifications
Standard & Poor's has a BBB- rating credit rating for Sony. An earlier version of this article said it was a junk grade.
