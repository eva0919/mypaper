Sony Corp. moved a step closer to shipping videogame consoles in China, as it seeks to join Microsoft Corp. in tapping a market where devices like PlayStations and Xboxes have long been banned.
According to a filing, a factory in Shanghai・s free-trade zone affiliated with the Japanese electronics company would start packaging consoles in December. The filing said the facility could package 200,000 consoles a year.
A Sony spokesman said the 200,000 figure doesn・t represent an actual business plan, adding its operation will be based on other factors such as the number of software titles it can sell. He declined to comment further on Sony・s plans.
The filing was an environmental assessment posted by a Sony local partner on the official website of the free-trade zone. It didn・t specify the type of console that would be shipped.
Sony signed a deal earlier this year with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group Co. to make and sell PlayStation game consoles in China. The move came after the Chinese government in September lifted a 14-year ban on the sale of videogame consoles in the country.
Microsoft began selling its Xbox One through the free-trade zone late last month.
China has long kept a tight leash on the videogame industry out of concern about violent content. The Xbox One titles approved for sale don・t include violent games such as the ：Halo； and ：Call of Duty； titles.
The filing was reported by local media in August and on Thursday by Bloomberg News.
