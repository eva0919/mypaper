LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - With Christian Bale parting ways on the project, Sony has moved quickly to find the man to portray the late Apple founder Steve Jobs.               
Michael Fassbender is in early talks to play "Jobs" in the the Sony biopic that Danny Boyle is directing, sources confirm.               
Based on Walter Isaacson's biography "Steve Jobs," the real-life drama is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin.               
Seth Rogen is in talks to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Scott Rudin will produce along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.               
Sorkin has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple's famous product launches.               
"The first one being the Mac," he told the Daily Beast. "The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod."               
"It's a little like writing about the Beatles," he added. "There are so many people out there that know him and revere him."               
Leonardo DiCaprio had been circling the role but eventually passed to take time off from acting. David Fincher had also been in talks at one point to direct.               
Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul's death in 2011.
