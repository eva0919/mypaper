Outerwall・s Redbox, Lions Gate Reach New Deal on Movie Rentals

Outerwall Inc.・s Redbox has signed a new two-year deal with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. that helps to alleviate investor concerns about the DVD kiosk company・s ability to maintain relations with Hollywood amid major changes to its business.
Lions Gate・s prior deal with Redbox had expired on Aug. 31 and, as weeks went by with no news, some analysts had begun to question whether there were issues between the two companies.
As with its previous deal, Lions Gate will continue to allow Redbox to rent its DVDs and Blu-ray discs the same day they go on sale. Three other studios delay Redbox rentals until four weeks after their DVDs are available to buy, in a bid to boost more profitable purchases. Redbox pays less for new movies available only on a delayed basis.
The new Lions Gate agreement expires in September 2016 and includes an option to renew.
Sony Corp.・s Sony Pictures Entertainment and Comcast Corp.・s Universal Pictures both recently exercised options to renew their deals with Redbox by one year, until September 2015 and December 2015, respectively.
Redbox・s revenue and operating income declined in the quarter ended June 30 as the once fast-growing company has stalled, with few new locations to install kiosks and increasing competition from digital outlets. A joint venture to rent movies online with Verizon Communications Inc. was recently shut down after performing poorly.
Earlier this year, Outerwall hired a veteran Warner Bros. executive to take over the Redbox business in a bid to transform it and return to growth.
Deals with Time Warner Inc.・s Warner Bros. and Viacom Inc.・s Paramount Pictures expire in December, while one with 21st Century Fox Inc.・s Twentieth Century Fox ends in April.
