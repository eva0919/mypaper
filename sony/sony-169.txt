SoftBank Is in Talks With DreamWorks Animation; Japanese Telecom Considers Acquisition, Investment in Studio After Dropping T-Mobile Pursuit

SoftBank Corp. is in talks to buy or otherwise link up with DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., people familiar with the negotiations said, a deal that could help the Japanese company and the Hollywood studio as they seek new ways to compete with rivals world-wide.
Coming nearly two months after SoftBank dropped a possible bid for T-Mobile US Inc., a DreamWorks Animation deal could give the conglomerate's Sprint Corp. unit another way to try to challenge top U.S. mobile carriers AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.
Rather than directly expand his telecommunications network, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son now appears to be focusing more on acquiring content creators, mostly videogame studios so far, whose products can be used to woo potential mobile subscribers.
Mr. Son early last month decided against bidding for T-Mobile, the fourth-largest U.S. cellular operator, and combining it with No. 3 Sprint, amid antitrust concerns in Washington.
SoftBank is well positioned for acquisitions in part because of billions of dollars in paper gains from the recent initial public offering of Chinese Internet company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., of which SoftBank owns 32%.
The people familiar with the talks declined to disclose a possible price for DreamWorks Animation, the market value of which is about $2 billion. One of the people said the talks were in the early stages and could lead to a distribution partnership or a SoftBank investment in DreamWorks, rather than an outright purchase. The talks were reported Saturday evening by the Hollywood Reporter.
DreamWorks Animation has long struggled as a relatively small, publicly traded movie studio and being absorbed by a conglomerate like SoftBank could shield the studio from investor pressure. The U.S. company's stock tends to rise or fall based on individual movies' financial performance, and a string of recent disappointments has cut the company's share price almost in half since 2010.
The studio has released some of the biggest hits in animation history, including the "Shrek" and "Madagascar" films. But more recent titles, such as "Rise of the Guardians" and "Turbo," have been much less successful.
CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has been touting a strategy to reduce his company's reliance on the two or three feature films it makes each year by expanding into television, online video and consumer products. But given DreamWorks Animation's modest size it would be nearly impossible to build a global infrastructure that could compete meaningfully with the theme parks, television networks and consumer-products division owned by big companies like Walt Disney Co.
DreamWorks Animation also faces competition from smaller, nimbler rivals, such as "Ice Age" producer Blue Sky Studios Inc. and "Despicable Me" creator Illumination Entertainment. Those closely held studios' success at the box office, often with movies that cost less than DreamWorks productions, have put pressure on Mr. Katzenberg to reduce his studio's costs.
A deal with SoftBank would help the Glendale, Calif., studio expand in the fast-growing Asia market. Two years ago, DreamWorks Animation joined several Chinese investment companies to set up a studio in China to create animated and action films for global audiences.
Though DreamWorks Animation is a small studio, it has a high profile because it is headed by Mr. Katzenberg, who founded the broader DreamWorks SKG studio with former music executive David Geffen and movie director Steven Spielberg. The animation studio spun off in 2004.
DreamWorks Animation reported a second-quarter net loss of $15.4 million on revenue of $122.3 million. The company's movies are released through the Twentieth Century Fox unit of 21st Century Fox, which until last year was part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.
With his pursuit of DreamWorks Animation, Mr. Son becomes the first prominent Japanese investor to pursue Hollywood since a quarter-century ago, when Japanese electronics companies snapped up studio assets.
He has said he wants to make SoftBank the biggest company in the world and recently told investors that he intended to increase its market value to ?200 trillion, or nearly $2 trillion, by 2040 from just shy of ?10 trillion today.
The Tokyo-based company this month bolstered its war chest for expansion with the Alibaba IPO. SoftBank's stake cost about $20 million 14 years ago and now is valued at roughly $71 billion.
Mr. Son is said to keep a whiteboard in his office with an ever-changing list of possible deals. SoftBank already has investments in more than 1,300 companies.
"Content, media and Internet businesses in the U.S., which they can expand globally, should be the main target for SoftBank," said Satoru Kikuchi, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. Because SoftBank already has network infrastructure, it can "leverage it with content businesses."
In recent months, reports have linked SoftBank to a range of potential targets, including U.S.-based Internet company Yahoo Inc., British mobile operator Vodafone Group PLC, Mexican wireless carrier Grupo Iusacell SA de CV and Line Corp., the Japanese operator of a fast-growing mobile messaging service. SoftBank already owns a stake in Yahoo Japan Corp.
But business associates of Mr. Son say he remains attracted to the growth potential of the U.S. despite the T-Mobile setback. He wants to expand SoftBank's media content, seeing that as a way to expand by giving SoftBank's mobile networks a competitive edge, they say.
To expand digital content, SoftBank in July hired Nikesh Arora, one of the driving forces behind the growth of Google Inc.'s lucrative search advertising business. The discussions between SoftBank and DreamWorks Animation began advancing with his arrival, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Son has met with Mr. Katzenberg, though Mr. Arora has been leading the talks, the person said.
SoftBank last month acquired control of Supercell Oy, a Finland-based mobile-game company that created titles such as "Clash of Clans.'' SoftBank also owns a controlling sake in Japan's GungHo Online Entertainment Inc., the developer of "Puzzle & Dragons." Such investments have made SoftBank the top-grossing provider of mobile-game applications for smartphones world-wide, according to research firm App Annie.
Yet efforts by telecoms and media companies to bring content and distribution under the same roof often have failed to live up to expectations. France's Vivendi SA in 2004 sold control of its Hollywood assets to General Electric Co., only four years after acquiring them. And Japan's Sony Corp. has struggled to reap the benefits of owning electronics and entertainment arms.
Mr. Son's Hollywood dreams recall Japanese deals in the movie industry in the late 1980s by Sony and others.
