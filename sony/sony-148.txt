* Hewlett-Packard Co plans to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, the latest attempt by the technology company to improve its fortunes by breaking itself in two.

* Big Aluminum has spent two years shutting smelters to shrink a supply glut that has led to rotten prices. The strategy has been successful for the most part.

* Out of office and six years after the events unfolded, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and other architects of the U.S. government's response to the financial crisis are likely to get their toughest grilling yet this week. The questions will come from prominent lawyer David Boies as he pursues a lawsuit brought by former American International Group Inc Chief Executive Maurice Greenberg who is challenging the terms of the 2008 bailout.

* Becton Dickinson Co agreed to buy CareFusion Corp in a $12.2 billion deal designed to provide a full range of medical products to hospitals, which are under pressure to cut costs and improve quality.

* RadioShack Corp found the cash lifeline it needed to survive the busiest time of year. But the next few months will be no holiday. The Fort Worth, Texas, company needs to tick a series of boxes that includes improving sales, renegotiating credit lines and coming up with a business plan for next year. And even if it pulls that off, its hedge-fund lenders, rather than the retailer's shareholders, will reap most of the rewards. (http://on.wsj.com/1rQmS2u)
