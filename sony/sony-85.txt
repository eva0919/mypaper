Omnicom Group Inc. posted a stronger-than-expected 24% increase in earnings in the third quarter, helped by revenue growth in all markets.
The advertising company has been bolstered by revenue increases across major markets, especially the U.S., despite its failed $35 billion merger with French rival Publicis Group SA earlier this year. The total impact of the abandoned transaction was $9.2 million.
U.S. revenue rose 10% to $2 billion, fueled by media operations. Earlier this year, Omnicom won about $2 billion in new business from well-known brands such as CVS, Johnson & Johnson, Sony and Heinz. International revenue increased 4.7% to $1.73 billion.
Overall, the company posted a profit of $243.8 million, or 95 cents a share, compared with $196 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 7.4% to $3.75 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected per-share earnings of 90 cents and revenue of $3.7 billion.
Organic revenue improved 8.9% in North America and 2.2% in Europe. The company also said organic revenue increased 4.4% in Asia Pacific and 2.5% in Latin America. In Africa and the Middle East, organic revenue jumped 18%
