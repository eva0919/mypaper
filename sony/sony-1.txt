LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - After a heated bidding war that had most of the majors vying for it over the weekend, Open Road has won the U.S. rights to the untitled spec revolving around the Edward Snowden story that has Oliver Stone directing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt starring.
As Deadline Hollywood reported earlier in the week, studio execs first received the script Friday afternoon with the first offers coming in sometime that evening. Wild Bunch has nabbed the international rights.
Stone is writing and directing and will produce with Eric Kopeloff and Moritz Borman.
Snowden's story is now familiar to most: the former U.S. intelligence analyst released more classified documents than anyone since Daniel Ellsberg's leaking of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. He has been on the run ever since.
Stone acquired the rights to the book "Time of the Octopus" by Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, which is considered the closest thing to a documented account of the events since Snowden first released the documents.
Production would likely begin at the end of the year or in the early first quarter of 2015, which is a good thing given that this isn't the only Snowden project in town. Sony already has the rights to "No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State" with the James Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli of EON Productions producing the pic.
Deadline first broke the Open Road news.
