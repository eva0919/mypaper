LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Scarlett Johansson is headed to TV.
The "Avengers" and "Lucy" actress will star in a limited series for Sony Pictures TV based on the 1913 Edith Wharton novel "The Custom of the Country," sources confirm. Johansson will also executive produce the eight-episode series, which is about to hit the market, from Charles Finch's Pink Sands.
Christopher Hampton ("Atonement," "Dangerous Liaisons") is set to write from his original screenplay. "Custom of the Country" follows Midwestern girl Undine Spragg, to be played by Johansson, who attempts to rise in New York City society.
Wharton's Pulitzer-winning novel "Age of Innocence" was also brought to screen in 1993 in a film starring Michelle Pfeiffer. The author is also known for "The Reef" and "The House of Mirth," both of which were adapted to features in 1999 and 2000, respectively.
Finch and Hampton are also exec producing with Johansson. Johansson is repped by CAA and LBI and can next be seen in "Avengers: Age of Ultron."
