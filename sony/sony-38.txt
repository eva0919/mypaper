TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp  reported a second-quarter operating loss on Friday that was narrower than analysts had estimated, as blockbuster sales of its PlayStation 4 games console reduced the impact of a sluggish smartphone division.               
Operating loss reached 85.6 billion yen ($771 million) in July-September, compared with the 164.3 billion yen average estimate of 3 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. In the same quarter last year, Sony booked a profit of 14.8 billion yen.               
The company posted a net loss of 136 billion yen for the quarter and held its full-year net loss forecast at 230 billion yen.               
Sony also lowered its smartphone sales outlook to 41 million handsets from 43 million, compared with 39 million last year.
