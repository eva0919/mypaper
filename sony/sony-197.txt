Sept 19 (Reuters) - Following is a table highlighting this financial
year's assumed currency rates for some major Japanese firms and the impact
on annual operating profit of a 1 yen move lower against both the dollar
and the euro.
    The yen is currently trading at around 109 to the dollar, much weaker
than most companies had anticipated. The Japanese currency's rapid descent
to six-year lows against the greenback is starting to push beyond comfort
zones for three quarters of Japanese firms, a Reuters poll showed,
highlighting the potential for profits to be squeezed as import costs
climb.
