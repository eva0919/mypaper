GameStop Plans to Increase Holiday Hiring; Videogame Retailer Points to Preparation for New Game Sales

GameStop Corp. plans to hire about 25,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season, an increase of 47% from last year.
The videogame retailer said it plans to hire seasonal "game advisers," 250 consumer electronics technicians for its refurbishment operation center and warehouse personnel for its distribution centers.
Part of the reason for the stepped-up hiring plans includes preparation for new games for Microsoft's Xbox One, the Nintendo Wii U and Sony's PlayStation 4.
GameStop also expects to see demand from consumers who want to trade-in their older smartphones and trade up to Apple's iPhone 6.
The introduction of updated versions of the Xbox and Playstation have bolstered GameStop's results recently.
During August the retailer reported its second-quarter profit nearly doubled thanks to booming demand for the new videogame consoles, which more than doubled GameStop's hardware sales for the period. New games for the consoles drove software sales, which rose nearly 16%.
Retailers typically hire temporary, part-time staff to help handle the higher traffic that occurs during the holidays.
HHGregg Inc. said Thursday that it plans to hire more than 450 sales associates for the holiday season, down from 500 last year.
Toys "R" Us and Target Corp. have both disclosed plans to hire the same number of employees as last year, while Kohl's Corp. plans to hire 67,000 workers, up from 50,000 a year ago.
