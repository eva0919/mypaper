LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The flood of high-profile new releases continues, with new Blu-ray Discs and DVDs accounting for seven of the top 10 sellers on Nielsen VideoScan's weekly overall disc sales chart for the week ending Sept. 21.               
At the top: Warner's "Godzilla" remake-of-a-remake-of-a-remake, which easily debuted at No. 1 on both the First Alert chart, which tracks combined Blu-ray Disc and DVD sales, and Nielsen's dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart.               
The summer theatrical blockbuster grossed more than $200 million in U.S. theaters, nearly 50% more than Sony Pictures' 1998 retelling of the classic horror story of a giant dinosaur wreaking havoc on modern civilization.               
Coming in at No. 2, also on both charts, was 20th Century Fox's "The Fault in Our Stars," a romantic drama that earned $124.8 million in theaters. The film, which boasts a cast of young stars familiar to teens through movies like "Divergent," sold 82.8% as many units as "Godzilla" its first week in stores, according to Nielsen data. Looking at Blu-ray Disc sales only, "Fault" sold just 56% as many units, which isn't surprising given that "Godzilla" generated 58% of its total sales from the high-definition version, to just 39% for "Fault."               
Walt Disney Studios' "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," which debuted at No. 1 the previous week, slipped to No. 3 on both charts, followed by two more high-ranking newcomers: season seven of the hot TV series "The Big Bang Theory," from Warner, which bowed at No. 4, and the Sony Pictures comedy "Think Like a Man Too," a sequel with a domestic box office gross of $65.2 million, entering the chart at No.5.               
On the overall disc chart, "Barbie and the Secret Door," Universal Studios' latest direct-to-video movie starring the iconic Mattel doll, debuted at No. 6, followed by Walt Disney's "Frozen" at No. 7, the same position it held the prior week.               
Rounding out the First Alert top 10 were the 20th Century Fox crime drama "Brick Mansions" at No. 8, down from its No. 2 debut the previous week, and two more new releases: "Castle: The Complete Sixth Season," from Walt Disney Studios, at No. 9, and "Arrow: The Complete Second Season," from Warner, at No. 10.               
On Home Media Magazine's rental chart for the week, "Think Like a Man Too" was the highest-ranking new release, debuting at No. 2. Sony Pictures is one of three major studios that distributes its new releases immediately to all retailers, including Netflix and Redbox, instead of waiting 28 days as the other three majors do.               
"Captain America: The Winter Soldier" soared up to No. 1 after debuting at No. 7 the previous week.               
Lionsgate's "Draft Day" slipped to No. 3 from No. 2, while the previous week's top rental, 20th Century Fox's "The Other Woman," slid to No. 4. Rounding out the top five was "Moms' Night Out," from Sony Pictures, down a notch from No. 4 the prior week.
