Tokyo stocks rose 2.7% to a seven-year high Tuesday, bringing gains to 7.7% since the Bank of Japan・s surprise decision Friday to expand easing measures, with a stronger dollar powering buying.
After breaking into positive territory Friday, the Nikkei Stock Average is up 3.5% for the year and trading at its highest level since October 2007. The market was closed Monday for a national holiday.
The dollar was at ?113.66 late in Asia, well up from ?109.22 Thursday, before the Bank of Japan・s move.
Japanese exporters were among the big gainers on the Nikkei. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. was up 9.6%, Sony Corp. rose 9.0% and Panasonic Corp. was up 4.0%.
In Korea, the Kospi fell 1.0% to 1935.19 as Korean exporters such as auto and electronics goods makers declined on worries that rivals in Japan will have a pricing edge in global markets. The index is down 3.8% this year and is the worst performing among major indexes in the region.
Hyundai Motor Co. lost 3.5% and Kia Motors was down 0.6%, after the companies agreed to pay a combined fine of $100 million and forfeit regulatory credits valued at $200 million to settle charges they overstated the fuel economy of vehicles sold in the U.S.
Markets elsewhere in the region were mixed.
The Shanghai Composite Index was flat at 2430.68 and Hong Kong・s Hang Seng Index was down 0.3% at 23845.66. HSBC was down 0.5% in Hong Kong after it released weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter late Monday. The bank is the biggest component stock on the Hang Seng Index.
Japan・s central bank took markets by surprise Friday as it increased its buying of government bonds to ?80 trillion (around $700 billion) annually from ?60 trillion-?70 trillion. The $1.1 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund also said Friday it would boost its domestic stock allocation to 25% from 12%.
：Another 15% appreciation in stocks from Friday・s close to the end of 2014 isn・t out of the question,； said CLSA equity strategist Nicholas Smith.
