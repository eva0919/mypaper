For Xiaomi, a Tidy Profit On Cheap Smartphones

HONG KONG -- Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc., which was founded jut four years ago, already is among the world's largest smartphone makers.
Now a confidential document viewed by The Wall Street Journal shows that Xiaomi's net profit nearly doubled last year, making it an unusually lucrative business in an industry where most players selling cheap handsets struggle to break even.
Xiaomi, which a few months ago surpassed Samsung Electronics Co. as the biggest smartphone vendor in China by shipments, presented the document to banks in its recent pitch to raise $1 billion in loans for overseas expansion or acquisition.
A table in the document showed that Xiaomi's net profit last year rose 84% to 3.46 billion yuan ($566 million) from 1.88 billion yuan in 2012. Its revenue more than doubled to 27 billion yuan. Another table included a forecast of a 75% net profit increase this year.
A Xiaomi spokeswoman declined to comment.
Xiaomi's rapid growth and strong earnings are also part of broader changes in the smartphone market where Chinese players are greatly increasing their presence, challenging the dominance of Samsung and Apple Inc. Over the past year, some of China's top smartphone vendors such as Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co., have been expanding overseas, posing a threat to Samsung in Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets.
Xiaomi's profit flies in the face of many analysts' belief that the Chinese company's rock-bottom pricing for its phones to increase market share has come at the expense of profit.
Its cheapest phone, the Redmi 1S starts at 699 yuan ($114) and its latest flagship model, the Mi4, starts at 1,999 yuan ($327).
A possible explanation for Xiaomi's ability to squeeze out so much profit while selling affordable phones is its inexpensive but efficient marketing tactics.
While established competitors spend fortunes on TV commercials and other traditional forms of advertising, Xiaomi's marketing has centered on social media and Internet forums where many users post comments, complaints and requests. In China, Xiaomi has expanded rapidly over the past few years by selling its phones online, relying on word-of-mouth among China's more than 600 million Internet users.
By interacting with users online and often tweaking its software and features based on their input, Xiaomi has built a loyal fan base in China. This strategy hasn't only proven effective in retaining users, but has also helped the company save a lot on marketing cost, analysts say.
According to the document, Xiaomi spent 876 million yuan, or 3.2% of its revenue, on sales and marketing expenses last year. Its spending in 2012 was 416 million yuan, or 3.9% of its revenue.
After seeing the success of Xiaomi's marketing strategy, many other Chinese handset makers have started focusing more on online marketing, using social media as a way to engage with consumers.
The document also provided some details on how Xiaomi earns its revenue. Even though the company sells smartphone applications, other software and services, 94% of its revenue came from handset sales last year, according to the document. Sales of services such as mobile games accounted for only 1% of its revenue.
"Xiaomi has done a great job of growing smartphone shipments and profits simultaneously," said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston. Still, analysts say it is unclear whether Xiaomi can sustain its profit margin, as China's smartphone market is becoming crowded and saturated.
As competition intensifies at home, Xiaomi has expanded overseas in Asian emerging markets such as India.
Despite its stellar growth, Xiaomi will likely face many hurdles in its international expansion. In mature markets such as the U.S., where it is critical for smartphone makers to secure access to intellectual property to defend themselves from patent lawsuits, Xiaomi will likely have difficulties expanding unless it finds ways to boost its patent portfolio, analysts say.
To finance its expansion outside China, Xiaomi is currently seeking another round of equity fundraising, according to people familiar with the situation. The next round will likely give Xiaomi a much higher valuation than the previous rounds. In August 2013, Xiaomi said it raised a fourth round of funding that valued the firm at $10 billion, more than double its June 2012 valuation of $4 billion.
Xiaomi -- pronounced "sheow-me" -- was founded in 2010 by Lei Jun, an entrepreneur who has been compared by Chinese media to Steve Jobs. Just a year into its existence, the company was already successful in creating a buzz around its products, starting with its social networking app called MiTalk, which attracted seven million users in two months. When Xiaomi launched its first smartphone, the Mi1, in late 2011, the first batch of shipments -- 100,000 units -- sold out in less than three hours.
In addition to selling its smartphones, Xiaomi charges for some of its services. It runs its own mobile-app store, called the Mi Market, and offers a whole host of smartphone services such as games, social networking and cloud storage. It also offers entertainment such as movies. Through its online store, the company also sells accessories such as phone cases and dolls of its rabbit mascot.
Xiaomi's share of the global smartphone market rose to 5.3% in the third quarter, making it the third-largest smartphone maker after Samsung and Apple, according to a market-research firm IDC. In the coming quarters, Lenovo, whose market share in the quarter was almost the same as Xiaomi's, is expected to become the third-largest player, as it recently completed its acquisition of Motorola Mobility.

WAL-MART STORES
Price to Retake Asia Helm
As President and CEO
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is bringing back Scott Price to oversee its Asia division less than six months after the company relocated the executive from Hong Kong to take an international strategy position at the company's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters.
Mr. Price will add his old job of president and chief executive for Asia to his new, Arkansas-based role leading real estate, mergers and acquisitions, and other corporate strategy for Wal-Mart's international operations, which include approximately 6,100 stores in 26 countries outside of the U.S.
He returns to the Asia job as Wal-Mart's operations in China, Japan and India are grappling with choppy sales results, compliance issues and government regulation.
The post was left vacant after Mr. Price's successor and former China head, Greg Foran, left the region to take over Wal-Mart's U.S. operations in August.

Smartphone Maker to Invest
$1 Billion for TV Content
Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. will invest $1 billion to acquire television content, the company said Tuesday, as it joins Chinese software giants in a race to control video programming in the country.
The company also said it hired Chen Tong, former chief editor of Web portal Sina, as vice president in charge of content investments.
"Xiaomi TV's content must become even more rich and colorful, and become the weather vane leading the industry," the company wrote on its television division's official Weibo microblog.
The move comes shortly after Jack Ma, founder of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., met with Hollywood executives to discuss possibilities of co-financing coming movies. Chinese Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent have been scrambling for exclusive content as they vie for the eyeballs of China's more than 600 million Internet users.

Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. isn¡¦t as immune as it used to be to the cautious American consumer.
The high-flyingmaker of trendy handbags, shoes and apparel blamed a slowdown in its North American business on a reduction in mall traffic and said it expected consumers to be more conservative with their spending during the coming holiday season.
The news showed that this fall¡¦s slowdown in the apparel business proved punishing not only for turnaround cases like J.C. Penney Co., but also some of retail¡¦s better performers. Kors lowered its forecast for sales excluding newly opened or closed stores for the year.
Shares in Kors were down nearly 8% at $71.96 in Tuesday morning trading.
The tempered outlook came as the company posted an otherwise strong quarter, buoyed by international growth. Profit for the three months ended Sept. 27 rose 42% to $207 million from $145.8 million a year earlier. Total revenue¡Xwhich includes licensing revenue¡Xjumped 43% to $1.06 billion. North American revenue increased 30% to $802 million, while sales excluding newly opened or closed locations increased 11%. European revenue more than doubled to $238 million, with sales excluding newly opened or closed locations increasing 41%.
Michael Kors had defied the expectations of some analysts and investors who argued that the company couldn¡¦t sustain its momentum as its products were distributed to an ever wider clientele. The company had argued that while it expected to sales to slow eventually, its brand of luxury populism would ensure a large audience for Kors as an accessible luxury brand.
John Idol, chief executive, said the decline in mall traffic was more significant during the quarter than expected and that sales growth excluding newly opened or closed stores and the rate at which Kors turned browsers into buyers ¡§wasn¡¦t as high as we anticipated.¡¨
Kors isn¡¦t ramping up promotions beyond what was planned, despite an environment that is very price sensitive. ¡§It¡¦s the right thing to do for a luxury brand,¡¨ Mr. Idol said.
The forecast for the current quarter was weaker than what Wall Street was expecting. For the year, the company now expects same-store sales to rise by a percentage in the mid teens, versus its previous call for a high teens increase. Kors raised its overall revenue guidance slightly, to a range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion.
Kors¡¦s board also authorized the company to buy back $1 billion in stock.

Corporate News: Google's Android Begins to Top Out

Google Inc.'s dominance over the smartphone landscape appears to be topping out, but the company is gaining more control over the devices that run its Android mobile operating system.
Android ran 84% of smartphones shipped globally in the third quarter, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, down slightly from 85% in the second quarter.
"Android's global smartphone market share is peaking," said Neil Mawston, executive director of Strategy Analytics. "Unless there is an unlikely collapse in rival Apple iPhone volumes in the future, Android is probably never going to go much above the 85% global market share ceiling."
Market share for Apple Inc.'s mobile operating system was 12% in the third quarter. Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Phone captured 3% market share and BlackBerry Ltd.'s devices had 1%.
Even if Android's market share doesn't go any higher, there is still good news for Google.
For starters, the market overall is still growing. Strategy Analytics forecasts 12% growth in smartphone shipments in 2015.
Google also appears to be turning the tide on the growth of so-called Android forks -- versions of the mobile operating software that are developed independently and don't come with Google's lucrative mobile apps.
As a percentage of total Android shipments, forks made up 37% in the third quarter, down slightly from 39% in the second quarter.
Google makes no money on Android itself, since it gives away the operating system free to device makers. It profits from revenue generated by advertisements that appear in apps like Google Search, Google Maps and YouTube, as well as a cut of sales of apps, files, subscriptions, and the like sold through the Google Play Store.
Mr. Mawston chalks up the decline in Android forks to a "maturing" China smartphone market, where most forked Android devices are sold.
In addition, Google is asserting control over its operating software through its newly launched Android One program, which is designed to provide cheap, reliable smartphones to consumers in emerging markets such as India. Those phones come with Google's various services installed.
Meantime, Samsung Electronics Co.'s dominance over other Android handset makers is waning, reducing the threat that the Korean hardware maker could wrest more control from Google. In the third quarter of this year, 25% of smartphones shipped were Samsung devices. That figure fell from the year prior, when it stood at 35%.
Samsung ships mostly Android devices and long has been dominant among Android vendors thanks in part to big commissions it pays to smartphone distributors, particularly in emerging markets. That gives them an incentive to push its devices over rivals.
Yet Samsung is losing out to startups like China's Xiaomi Inc., which are undercutting the Korean giant on price.
Samsung sells its smartphones at a premium and captures bigger profit margins on each device sold, while Xiaomi prices its devices closer to the cost of making them and makes its profit instead on the sale of accessories and software add-ons.
In the previous two years, as Samsung's market share peaked, it tried to assert more independence from Google by distributing more of its own services on its Android devices while simultaneously playing down the fact that Google's software powered them. That sparked concerns inside Google that it could lose some control over the operating system, according to people familiar with the company's internal deliberations.
Earlier this year, Samsung and Google reached a detente of sorts, when the companies agreed to a broad patent cross-licensing deal.
The biggest challenge to Google's mobile dominance could come from regulators. European Union antitrust authorities are poised to unleash a formal investigation into Android in the wake of concerns that Google shuts out rivals in promoting services such as Google Maps.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year about Google's strict agreements with handset makers that required them to feature those services prominently if they wanted access to the services in the first place.
A Google spokesman declined to comment.

WSJ.D Live (A Special Report) --- No Stores; No Ads; Just a Lot of Sales: Xiaomi's Hugo Barra describes how the Chinese phone maker relies on its 'family' of customers

Hugo Barra left Google Inc. a year ago to join Chinese-based Xiaomi Inc., the manufacturer of the best-selling phone in the world's biggest market, and a company that operates almost entirely without traditional advertising or retail stores. Xiaomi sold about 18 million phones in 2013 and is forecasting sales of 60 million units this year. The Wall Street Journal's deputy editor in chief, Rebecca Blumenstein, talked to Mr. Barra, Xiaomi's global vice president. Edited excerpts follow.
MS. BLUMENSTEIN: What is the biggest contributor to Xiaomi's success? Is it a cult that you've created in China?
MR. BARRA: Our core belief is basically that if you treat your users or customers as friends, if you listen to them carefully for their feedback, if you respect their views, if you really take care of them, they become attached to you and to your products. They tell their friends. They forgive your mistakes. They help you out. It's kind of like becoming part of a family. So, I prefer family to cult.
MS. BLUMENSTEIN: Many companies say they involve customers or fans in beta tests and testing. Does Xiaomi do completely external beta testing constantly?
MR. BARRA: That's a nice way to look at it. We have this website, which is our user forum. On the China side of the website, we have about 30 million registered users, and about 400,000 posts every day, from product feedback, bug reports, questions, feature recommendations and so on. On top of that, about 10% of people who buy our smartphones are on what we call our beta track. They've chosen to receive software updates every Friday, with new features, some of which are still sort of only half baked, half implemented, because they want to provide feedback.
MS. BLUMENSTEIN: You sell your phones at cost. You are a $10 billion company in revenue, perhaps one of the fastest-growing tech companies ever. But how are you going to make money?
MR. BARRA: We've built our own e-commerce platform from the very beginning. We sell the majority of our products on e-commerce that way. And it's not just phones. We have about 1,000 SKUs on our website.
If you look at our product portfolio, it's incredibly simple and focused. This year, we've only announced two new smartphone models, Redmi Note and Mi4. These models stay in the market for up to 24 months, so it's a very long life cycle. The economies of scale are huge. And all marketing is social media.
MS. BLUMENSTEIN: There have been some headlines about the security of data stored in Xiaomi phones being in data centers in China. Are you moving data centers outside of China to counter such concerns?
MR. BARRA: I actually think Chinese companies are, to a certain extent, held to a higher privacy standard than most companies out there.
We are moving to a global infrastructure with data centers in Asia Pacific, North America, and next year India.
That will help with performance. It helps us comply with local data protection regulations and so on. But then, it has this amazing benefit of making people feel better that they have their data next to them.
MS. BLUMENSTEIN: Jony Ive, Apple's senior vice president of design, has criticized certain phone makers for producing phones that looked a lot like iPhones. He called it outright theft. Many people took that to be, even if he didn't say Xiaomi, a direct slap at Xiaomi. What's your reaction?
MR. BARRA: I don't think Jony mentioned the word "Xiaomi." Our designers, our engineers, are inspired by great products, by great design out there. In today's world, who isn't? Point me to a product in our industry that had completely unique design language. You're not going to be able to find one.
Apple is the world's design Mecca. And Apple inspires itself on great products and great ideas as well. The iPhone 6, in my opinion the most beautiful smartphone ever built, without a doubt, carries design language that's very HTC-like from a few years back, of course with an astonishing twist of Apple innovation on top of it. But it is a somewhat familiar design language.
It's fascinating that Apple took existing ideas that were very good, added their twist of innovation on top, and in many cases actually made those ideas better or much better. Like, quick settings on iOS is much better than quick settings on Android. But it was on Android well before you'd find it on an iOS device. So, this idea of building upon great ideas and adding a twist of innovation is what they do. It's what we do.

HTC Sees Brighter Fourth-Quarter Sales; Smartphone Maker HTC Faces Competition From China, Apple but Expects to Stay Profitable

TAIPEI¡XHTC Corp. on Friday predicted sales would at least stay flat in the fourth quarter after three years of decline.
The Taiwanese smartphone maker expects revenue of 43 billion New Taiwan dollars to NT$47 billion (US$1.41 billion to US$1.55 billion) for the current quarter ending Dec. 31. The target range represents a growth of 2.7% to 12% from NT$41.86 billion in the third quarter, and as much as 9.6% higher than the NT$42.90 billion it fetched in the same period in 2013.
HTC also expects to remain profitable for the third straight quarter. In the three months ended Sept. 30, HTC reported a net profit of NT$640 million, compared with a net loss of NT$2.97 billion a year earlier.
We are forecasting a pretty material increase in handset shipment volume [for the fourth quarter],¡¨ Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang told investors during a conference call. Mr. Chang declined to disclose the company¡¦s shipment forecast.
¡§I hope the momentum will extend into the first quarter of next year,¡¨ Mr. Chang said.
But analysts say HTC still faces headwinds in a market dominated by Apple Inc. and fast-growing Chinese players.
A challenge HTC and most Android handset makers face in this quarter is the stronger-than-expected demand for the new iPhones. Apple recently launched two iPhones, one with a bigger 5? inch screen. Both offer one of the biggest revamps to the iPhone in two years and are well-timed for the year-end holiday season.
HTC, once the world¡¦s top smartphone maker by volume, dropped out of the top 10 largest handset vendors by shipments last year. Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. have been grabbing HTC¡¦s share in the high-end market, while low-cost Chinese makers have been squeezing the Taiwanese company in the mid- and low-end markets.
HTC is hoping to reverse years of shrinking sales by beefing up its midrange product lines and expanding into non-smartphone businesses.
The company has recently added a selfie-focused smartphone to its midprice Desire line. It has also unveiled the Nexus 9 tablet with Google Inc., a waterproof action camera and software for taking selfie photos.
Mr. Chang said HTC has plans to launch new smartphones over the next two quarters, but declined to give more details.
He also said the project with Google doesn¡¦t mean HTC is returning to contract manufacturing of phones and tablets for other brands.
¡§We are open to, and will also consider, co-branding opportunities with partners,¡¨ he added.
But the midtier market is getting crowded, which complicates HTC¡¦s reliance on that segment as a solution, analysts say.
Samsung said Thursday it would seek to compete head-on against low-priced Chinese rivals amid falling sales in China. Chinese brands like Xiaomi Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. are already dominating the that market.
¡§Apparently HTC is trying to stay away from the competition from Apple in the high-end segment. But the smartphone market, especially the mid- and low-end segments, is still very tough,¡¨ said KGI Securities analyst Richard Ko.

Rise of Chinese Phones Breaks Samsung's Grip

SEOUL -- The rapid deterioration of Samsung Electronics Co.'s mobile-phone business raises the question: Will Chinese companies soon rule the smartphone market?
The world's biggest smartphone maker by sales said Thursday that its third-quarter profit dropped 49% as less-expensive handsets, chiefly from China, ate away at its business. A trio of market-tracking firms confirmed that the South Korean technology company is losing ground even faster than many analysts had predicted.
Although Chinese handset makers have been pushing into smartphones for several years, the pace of their rise -- and Samsung's decline -- over the last half-year has been stunning.
Since the beginning of this year, global smartphone shipments have ballooned for Chinese smartphone makers including Xiaomi Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. Handsets from Chinese companies now account for 38% of the global market, more than Samsung and Apple Inc. combined, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Xiaomi jumped to third place in the global market, behind Samsung and Apple, with 5.6% in the third quarter. It had 3.9% in the first quarter.
Samsung's smartphone market share tumbled to 25% in the third quarter from 31% in the first, Strategy Analytics said. The tech company's mobile-phone profit margin dropped to 7% from 20%. Samsung blamed that decline in part on increased marketing costs to clear a glut of unsold smartphones that piled up in China and elsewhere.
Apple's iPhone had 12% of the market in the third quarter, down from 15% in the first.
Samsung isn't the only South Korean company struggling as low-cost Chinese rivals catch up. The Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade forecast recently that Chinese manufacturers will likely catch up with or surpass their Korean rivals within five years in areas including ships, petrochemicals, steel and textiles. In mid- to low-price smartphones, the government research group predicted that China would outstrip Korea within two years.
To be sure, gaining market share doesn't guarantee profit growth and can erode earnings for everyone. It isn't clear how much of a profit closely held Xiaomi or Huawei make on smartphones, if any.
But Samsung says it is determined to fight back. Samsung executives said Thursday that they would seek to compete more directly with rivals in mid- and low-price phones, where Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo sell smartphones for about $300. An equivalent model from Samsung can cost twice as much.
Kim Hyun-joon, a senior vice president in Samsung's mobile-communications business, said the company would tweak the design and user interface of its lower-end devices to set itself apart from its rivals.
Samsung also will seek to produce devices more economically. "The key is efficiency, to increase the number of components shared across mid- to low-end models, so that we can further leverage economies of scale," Mr. Kim said.
Samsung also is expected to shuffle executives, as the company typically does toward year-end, in its mobile division.
"Helped in part by management changes, we expect Samsung to work aggressively to retake business lost to Xiaomi and others in China," Jefferies analyst Sundeep Bajikar wrote in a note to clients.
Following poor earnings earlier this year, hundreds of senior managers in Samsung's mobile division took a 25% cut in their first-half bonuses, people familiar with the matter said. Executives and senior managers are bracing for more cost cuts, a person familiar with the situation said recently.
Even with Samsung's new strategy for dealing with its low-cost rivals, the company suggested the best days for its smartphone business may be behind it. Samsung's third-quarter profit margin of 7% for its mobile business was the lowest since the beginning of 2009. It followed 10 straight quarters in which the division's margin exceeded 15%. Mr. Kim said the mobile division's new goal is simply to maintain a double-digit margin.
Samsung still is going strong in semiconductors, a steady source of profit since before its smartphone successes of the past several years. The chip and components business contributed 57% of the company's third-quarter profit -- a contrast to just six months ago, when the mobile division represented 76% of Samsung's earnings.
Samsung's memory-chip business is riding strong demand, and the company is hoping that sales of processors will accelerate with the opening of a high-tech factory to start mass production by year-end.

In Smartphone Push, Lenovo Completes Motorola Deal

Lenovo Group Ltd. said Thursday it completed its $2.91 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility, as the world's largest personal-computer maker continues its expansion in the global smartphone market.
The deal with Lenovo opens a new chapter for Motorola, which was unprofitable as a unit of Google Inc. Lenovo, which makes the ThinkPad line of PCs and Yoga line of tablet-PC convertibles, first unveiled its plans to buy Motorola from Google in January.
Motorola intends to turn around its business by taking advantage of Lenovo's efficient supply chain and distribution networks as well as economies of scale that could bring down material-procurement costs. Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing has said he expects to make Motorola profitable within four to six quarters after completing the deal.
Lenovo will operate Motorola as a wholly owned subsidiary. Motorola's headquarters will stay in Chicago and President Rick Osterloh will continue to head the business, while Liu Jun, the head of Lenovo's mobile business, will become Motorola's chairman, Lenovo said.
Founded in China, Lenovo bought International Business Machines Corp.'s PC business in 2005. The company, now based in both China and the U.S., overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. to become the No. 1 PC maker by shipments last year.
As the global PC market has become saturated, Lenovo is seeking new sources of growth by expanding its smartphone business, trying to take on Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. in the global market. In the third quarter, Lenovo was the world's fourth-largest smartphone vendor with a 5.2% share, behind Samsung, Apple and China's Xiaomi Inc., according to research firm IDC.

World News: Asia: South Korea Struggles as Exports to China Falter

South Korea's economy failed to pick up in September as expected, deepening concerns over the recent poor performance of the country's exports to China.
Korea is an export powerhouse, but its shipments to China -- one of its largest markets -- are faltering because of increased competition from local producers. Samsung Electronics Co.'s third-quarter net profit, for instance, fell almost 50% on year, largely because rival Chinese handset manufacturers are snapping up market share.
Such developments are hurting Korea's economy, which exports huge amounts of parts to China for assembly, as well as finished goods. On Thursday, the government said industrial production grew only 0.1% on month in September, below economists' expectations of 1% growth.
That was a surprise because exports had recovered somewhat in September after declining in previous months. The disappointing data suggest manufacturers are running down inventories, says Yuanta Securities economist Lee Chul-hee -- hardly a vote of confidence in future exports to China.
The lackluster reading was "largely due to a surprise drop in electronics output, likely on the back of slower demand in China," said Barclays PLC economist Wai Ho Leong.
Consumer demand in China has been hit by an anticorruption drive by President Xi Jinping's administration. Lower-cost mobile handsets made by local companies such as Xiaomi Inc. also are eating South Korea's market share in China.
China is the destination of about a quarter of South Korea's total direct exports. Exports make up about half of South Korea's gross domestic product, and the country had regularly run double-digit export growth rates in the past. This year, the central bank expects the economy to grow a moderate 3.5% amid moribund exports.
President Park Geun-hye's government is trying to boost local demand to cut reliance on volatile overseas markets. In July, it announced a $40 billion stimulus package to encourage spending and jump-start the property market. The central bank cut interest rates in October to a record low of 2%.
The cuts so far have spurred neither the manufacturing sector nor local demand, with consumer confidence at a three-month low in October. The central bank's ability to further cut rates is limited given concerns over already high household debt levels, Mr. Lee said.
Seoul wants to deepen its domestic economy and move into higher-tech areas, fearing China soon will be a challenger in sectors such as electronics, steelmaking and ship building that South Korea has dominated until now.
A South Korean state research organization this week warned that Chinese manufacturers likely will catch up with or surpass their Korean rivals within five years in many areas. Some economists, though, say the threat to Korea has been overstated, betting that China is still far from closing in.

Samsung, Apple Lose Ground to China Smartphone Makers; Market Share for Industry Leader Samsung and Apple Decline as Chinese Smartphones Gain Popularity

The erosion of Samsung Electronics Co.¡¦s and Apple Inc.¡¦s dominance of the global smartphone market accelerated during the third quarter, as Chinese makers of low-cost phones continued to undercut the industry leaders, according to data from three market-share trackers released Thursday.
Samsung, the world¡¦s largest smartphone maker by shipments, saw its market share fall to 24.7% from 35% during the three months ended Sept. 30, its steepest decline since it became the industry leader in the third quarter of 2011, according to data provider Strategy Analytics. Upstart Chinese phone maker Xiaomi Inc. rose to third place with a 5.6% share, up from 2.1%, as its global handset shipments more than tripled.
Apple remained No. 2, with a 12.3% share, but its market share fell from 13.4% as supply problems held back the shipment of its latest-model iPhones, which went on sale in mid-September.
Market-share data released by IDC and Counterpoint Research Thursday showed similar results.
The latest data came after Samsung posted Thursday a sharply lower third-quarter net profit as intensified competition from Chinese smartphone makers hurt the South Korean technology giant¡¦s mobile business.
Linda Sui of Strategy Analytics estimated that Xiaomi was the fourth-most profitable handset maker in the third quarter, trailing Apple, Samsung and LG Electronics Inc. Xiaomi¡¦s preference for low-cost online distribution channels instead of bricks-and-mortar shops helped its profitability, she said.
Xiaomi, which means ¡§Little Rice¡¨ in Chinese, is known for its marketing savvy. The Beijing-based smartphone maker, founded in 2010, has been growing quickly across Asia by selling low-cost handsets that don¡¦t skimp on features, and has created a cultlike fan base among early adopters of new gadgets.
The company has also used social media in growing its popularity. Chairman Lei Jun, who has often been compared with Apple¡¦s late founder Steve Jobs for his presentation style at product launches, has more than 11 million followers on China¡¦s Twitter-like platform, Sina Weibo.
Looking to expand its business overseas, Xiaomi last year hired Hugo Barra, who was an executive at Google¡¦s Android business. The company has expanded into Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and India.
During the second quarter, Xiaomi overtook Samsung as the top smartphone maker in China, the world¡¦s largest smartphone market by shipments, according to market research firm Canalys.
Xiaomi has been expanding into other markets outside China, including Singapore, Malaysia, India and Indonesia and has been borrowing money to fund the expansion.
But industry observers say that despite Xiaomi¡¦s popularity on its home turf, it will face challenges getting consumers familiar with its brand overseas, where it remains relatively unknown.
Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co., meanwhile, have been expanding aggressively outside China. Lenovo¡¦s smartphone sales have been growing fast in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, while Huawei has been increasing its presence in the Middle East and Africa as well as Latin America. In emerging markets, both Huawei and Lenovo are challenging Samsung¡¦s dominance by selling inexpensive models with competitive technological features.
IDC said Samsung¡¦s third-quarter market share dropped 8.7 percentage points to 23.8% as its shipments fell 8.2% from a year earlier. Apple¡¦s market share fell to 12% from 12.9%, while Xiaomi came in third with a market share of 5.3%, up from 2.1% a year earlier. Lenovo ranked fourth with a market share of 5.2%, up from 4.7%, followed by LG¡¦s 5.1%.
Lenovo¡¦s market share is expected to rise after it completes the acquisition of U.S. handset maker Motorola Mobility later this year.
Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah said Samsung has been losing market share at every price point: in the premium segment to Apple; in the middle tier to Xiaomi, and Huawei; and in the bottom tier to Lenovo and a number of local brands such as Micromax in India and Mito in Indonesia.

Samsung Electronics Third-Quarter Profit Falls Sharply; Samsung¡¦s Mobile Business Continued to Lose Ground to Low-Cost Smartphone Makers

Samsung Electronics Co. on Thursday said its quarterly net profit nearly halved, as its mobile business continued to lose ground to low-cost Chinese smartphone makers¡Xa rivalry that is expected to intensify.
Samsung also warned that uncertainty remains for its mobile business in the current quarter, since it will have to ramp up marketing efforts to counter an anticipated year-end surge in competitors¡¦ smartphone launches.
Separately, data from three market-share trackers released Thursday showed Samsung¡¦s share of global smartphone sales fell sharply during the three months ended September. Although still ranked No. 1, Samsung had around a quarter of the smartphone market by sales, versus roughly a third just a year ago, according to International Data Corp., Counterpoint Research and Strategy Analytics.
Samsung said its net profit during the quarter ended in September fell 49% versus a year earlier, to 4.2 trillion won ($4 billion). That followed a 20% profit decline in the previous quarter.
The quarterly earnings drop was the result of a 74% year-over-year decline in profit from Samsung¡¦s mobile division, to 1.75 trillion won, the lowest since the second quarter of 2011. Weaker smartphone sales and lower prices ground Samsung¡¦s mobile margins down to 7%, the thinnest since the company began offering smartphones.
Samsung¡¦s semiconductor business replaced mobile as the company¡¦s largest profit driver for the first time in three years, accounting for 56% of total operating profit and logging a margin of 23%, up from 21% a year.earlier. Mobile-division profit accounted for 43% of Samsung¡¦s operating profit; as recently as the beginning of the year, the division had accounted for roughly three-quarters of total profit.
¡§We will focus on obtaining a sustainable double-digit percentage margin¡¨ in mobile phones, Kim Hyun-joon, a senior vice president at Samsung¡¦s mobile unit said during a conference call following the earnings release.
Company executives said they would try harder to differentiate Samsung¡¦s handsets from those of competitors next year by adopting more flexible displays and metal frames. But analysts expect the introduction of next-generation devices like foldable-screen phones in sizable volumes to be difficult due to technological hurdles.
Regaining a foothold against low-cost brands will remain a challenge amid heightened price competition, analysts say, leaving the company with a bleak outlook for its mobile unit.
Upstart Chinese phone-maker Xiaomi Inc. recently overtook Samsung in China as the largest smartphone vendor in the country, and figures released Thursday showed it jumped to the No. 3 spot globally¡Xlargely driven by its strong China performance.
In the latest sign of how important the China market is to Samsung, the Samsung Group Wednesday released a rare statement from Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee, the son of ailing Chairman Lee Kun-hee who is seen as the conglomerate¡¦s next leader, on a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
¡§Samsung will actively expand its business in China in accordance with the government¡¦s policies and hope to be a loved company within China that makes contributions to its society,¡¨ Mr. Lee told Chinese leaders, according to the statement.
China isn't only an important smartphone market for Samsung¡Xit also is expected to play an increasingly large role for the company¡¦s chip business. In 2012, Samsung unveiled plans to invest $7 billion for a new chip plant in China over the course of several years. Following an initial investment of $2.3 billion, the company began producing memory chips in 2013 from the plant in Xi¡¦an city.
Samsung¡¦s total operating profit during the quarter ended in September slid 60% from a year earlier to 4.1 trillion won on a 20% fall in revenue to 47.4 trillion won for the quarter, in line with market expectations.
Samsung shipped 79.2 million smartphones during the quarter ended Sept. 30, a drop from the 88.4 million units shipped during the same period a year earlier, according to Strategy Analytics.
The company didn¡¦t disclose exact shipment figures for its mobile phones.

LG Electronics Buoyed By Smartphone Sales

SEOUL -- LG Electronics Inc. said Wednesday its third-quarter profit nearly doubled from a year earlier after it sold a record number of smartphones.
The South Korean company's mobile devices continued to gain market share from bigger rival Samsung Electronics Co., particularly at home. But globally, LG is struggling against Apple Inc. and like Samsung faces a newer challenge from fast-rising Chinese handset makers.
LG said its net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 87% to 203 billion won ($194 million) from 108.5 billion won a year earlier.
The company sold 16.8 million smartphones during the quarter, up 39% from 12 million sold a year earlier and a record for the company. Operating profit doubled to 461 billion won, with the mobile division accounting for more than a third of profits, the company said.
Following its second consecutive quarter of profit in the mobile division, LG said it would stick to a two-track smartphone strategy, spearheaded by the company's premium G series and cheaper L series models.
Local analysts estimate LG's global market share came close to 5% in the latest quarter, slightly higher than last year's levels. But a continued tug of war is expected against upstart Chinese brands such as Xiaomi Inc., which is estimated by analysts to have sold a similar number of smartphones as LG during the same period.
LG is better positioned in South Korea, where its handsets grabbed a 27% market share in the third quarter, its highest in years, and up from just 18% a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. During the same period, Samsung's share slipped to 60% from 66%, according to the same estimates.
LG executives hope the progress it is making at home will translate into overseas sales.
"Before, they [overseas partners] didn't even spare us a glance. But now, most carriers take our products without any doubt," said Chris Yie, a vice president for marketing at LG's mobile division, in a recent interview.
The number of global carriers that placed orders for LG's latest G3 smartphone at launch was roughly 170, up by 30% from the previous model, Mr. Yie said.
The big four U.S. telecommunications companies -- Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. -- all sell the G3.
Analysts estimate Samsung to have had roughly 200 carrier partners for the launch of its latest top-of-the-line model, the Galaxy S5.

Xiaomi's $1 Billion Loan Draws A Big Crowd

Bankers still feeling the buzz of Alibaba Group's blockbuster listing last month have been casting around for the next big tech deal out of China. If the appetite by creditors to lend to Xiaomi Inc. is anything to go by, this four-year-old smartphone maker could be it.
Xiaomi, which sells more smartphones in China than Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc., has borrowed $1 billion from 29 banks for a three-year loan, its first move to tap overseas funds for cash. The company has moved beyond China to sell in India and Indonesia, and a person familiar with the loan said Xiaomi is borrowing the money to expand overseas.
The loan is set to be completed on Friday, people familiar with the matter said. The lead bankers on the loan are Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley. Among others are ICBC Asia, a subsidiary Chinese lender of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Brazil's Banco do Brasil, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Credit Suisse Group SA and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
In attracting so many banks to its loan, Xiaomi has beaten Alibaba, which borrowed $8 billion last year from 22 banks, many of which were eager to get in on the Chinese e-commerce giant's IPO mandate, bankers said.
Alibaba's $25 billion IPO in New York last month was the largest ever, and all six of its lead banks were among the lenders on its $8 billion loan. Those six were Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc.
Banks often charge less on loans than on other investment-banking deals, but lending can help build rapport that can lead to advising those clients on IPOs or mergers.
"Investment banks see business opportunities with [Chinese technology firms] in the future, and participating in a syndicated loan could be a good step in starting a relationship," said Julien Begasse de Dhaem, Asia-Pacific head of fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Stanley.
Bankers said Xiaomi isn't planning to go public soon. The company declined to comment.
Xiaomi is borrowing at attractive terms. Banks are charging 2.325 percentage points over the London interbank offered rate for the $1 billion it is borrowing in two tranches. Companies with similar ratings to Xiaomi often are charged 2.5 percentage points over Libor.
The number of banks on the Xiaomi deal isn't a record in Asia, but it is rare that an unlisted company attracts so many lenders for a debut syndicated loan, according to bankers.
Closely held Indonesian conglomerate CT Corp. borrowed $1.3 billion from more than 30 banks in March. But CT has been borrowing in the international markets for years.
"Lenders feel more comfortable now with the technology industry than they did a few years back," said Amit Khattar, Asia head of loan capital markets at Deutsche Bank.
Still, banks have turned more cautious toward lending to Chinese borrowers, especially as the economy slows. But the right credit always attracts lenders, said Sonia Li, Asia-Pacific head of syndicated and leveraged finance at J.P. Morgan.
Set up just four years ago, Xiaomi has been expanding quickly. In July, the firm started selling its phone in India, where early sales have been so encouraging that Xiaomi is considering making phones there. India is the world's second-largest cellphone market after China.
Speaking at the WSJD Live Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, Hugo Barra, Xiaomi's global vice president, said the company is looking at expansion into Brazil and Mexico. Sometimes called "the Apple of China" for the excitement it generates from consumers, Xiaomi sold about 18 million phones in the past year and it is forecasting sales of 60 million units this year.
While this loan is Xiaomi's first overseas, it isn't its first fundraising. The firm has raised a couple of rounds of funding by bringing in outside investors, but has declined to name them. In August 2013, Xiaomi said it raised a fourth round of funding that valued the firm at $10 billion, more than double its June 2012 valuation of $4 billion.

Greetings from Laguna Beach,
Here¡¦s an update on our WSJD Live technology conference:
Today Andrew Conrad, head of the Life Sciences team at the Google X research lab, revealed that Google is designing tiny magnetic particles to patrol the human body for signs of cancer and other diseases¡Xthe latest example of the company¡¦s sweeping ambition. The project, however, still appears to be more than five years from fruition. We also heard from Xiaomi¡¦s global vice president, Hugo Barra, who defended the Chinese smartphone maker¡¦s business model which focuses on markets where the price of a smartphone constitutes a large part of a consumer¡¦s income. Axelle Lemaire, France¡¦s deputy minister for digital affairs, talked about the regulation of personal data, noting that European governments are discussing how to update rules for global tech titans. ¡§If they really want to be international players, they have to adapt a little bit more,¡¨ she said. FireEye¡¦s Kevin Mandia discussed tactics used in security breaches. Coursera CEO Richard Levin and Gene Block, the chancellor of the University of California in Los Angeles, explored the impact of massive open online courses, or MOOCs. And venture investor Marc Andreessen offered his thoughts on startup valuations and what needs to be done to make the technology industry more inclusive of women.
In case you missed it, yesterday Alibaba¡¦s Jack Ma shared his interest in partnering with Apple in financial payments, and Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was going to meet with Mr. Ma this week to discuss the prospect. Today we look at the potential benefits and pitfalls of such an alliance, noting a host of technical and possible regulatory hurdles. During the conference, Mr. Cook also gave us an update on the recent launch of Apple Pay, a service that will help users of the latest model iPhones pay for items in stores or in mobile apps. In a review of Apple Pay, our personal technology columnist Geoffrey Fowler writes that the service beats PayPal and Google, but needs more reach before we can eradicate wallet bloat. And don¡¦t miss tomorrow¡¦s coverage of WSJD Live, which you can follow here. I will be interviewing News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Telefonos de Mexico chief Carlos Slim on the bets they¡¦ve won and lost. We will also hear the perspectives of other entrepreneurs, executives and innovators, including Sue Desmond-Hellmann, James Cameron and Steve Ballmer.

Xiaomi Defends Its Smartphone Business Model; Markets Chosen to Fit Low-Cost Approach, Hugo Barra Says

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.¡XChinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. said its international expansion plans are dictated by choosing markets where its low-cost business model will work well and not by avoiding areas of potential intellectual-property-litigation risk sweeping across the smartphone industry.
Speaking at the WSJD Live Global Technology Conference, Hugo Barra, Xiaomi¡¦s global vice president, said it looks for markets where the price of a smartphone constitutes a large part of a consumer¡¦s income. Those markets, Mr. Barra said, are where Xiaomi¡¦s model of selling smartphones at near cost works especially well.
Xiaomi passed Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. to become the best-selling smartphone provider in China in the second quarter, according to Canalys, a research firm. It has moved into India, Indonesia and other parts of Asia. Mr. Barra said the company is looking at a move into Brazil and Mexico next.
Xiaomi has taken the Chinese smartphone market by storm. It offers its phones at rock-bottom prices, often selling out new models online in minutes. It makes money by charging for services and accessories that accompany the phones. It also relies on a legion of loyal fans to test new features and drum up enthusiasm for the company.
But for all of Xiaomi¡¦s successes, rivals and critics have said the company would face patent infringements if it expanded to the U.S. or Europe because it doesn¡¦t have enough intellectual property to strike cross-licensing patent deals with other smartphone manufacturers.
¡§Our situation when it comes to patents is the same as everyone else,¡¨ said Mr. Barra, noting that his company files for a significant number of patents in China and strikes licensing deals abroad. Litigation risk ¡§is not a determining factor¡¨ in deciding the best markets for Xiaomi¡¦s international expansion, he said.
The issue came to prominence earlier this month when Jony Ive, Apple¡¦s senior vice president of design, was asked about Xiaomi and how some smartphone designs seem to resemble the iPhone. Without mentioning Xiaomi specifically, the usually soft-spoken Mr. Ive said it was ¡§theft¡¨ and called it ¡§lazy.¡¨
Mr. Barra said there is no such thing as a completely unique design language in the smartphone industry, noting that Apple¡¦s iPhone 6 takes a chapter from designs by Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp. He says that what Apple does is no different than what Xiaomi does. ¡§This idea of building upon great ideas and putting a twist on it is what we do,¡¨ he said.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
Xiaomi¡¦s smartphones run on a version of Google Inc.¡¦s Android operating system. Xiaomi is sometimes called ¡§the Apple of China¡¨ for the excitement it generates among consumers. Xiaomi sold about 18 million phones in the past year and it is forecasting sales of 60 million units this year.
The company poses a threat to other smartphone manufacturers because of its willingness to accept low margins on hardware to make money elsewhere. For example, Xiaomi¡¦s popular Redmi phone is about a quarter of the price of the iPhone 6, which sells for more than $800 in China.
¡§We fundamentally believe that innovation is not a luxury item. Innovation is for everyone,¡¨ said Mr. Barra. ¡§We fundamentally believe that when it costs you $200 to make something, you shouldn¡¦t sell it for $600.¡¨
Mr. Barra reiterated that the company has been moving data belonging to international users to servers outside China¡Xin Singapore and North America¡Xin an effort to assuage users¡¦ concerns about privacy. He said the decision to migrate servers outside of China was driven partially by a desire to improve performance by reducing network outages and latency, but he said users like to have data close.
¡§It makes people feel better that they have data next to them,¡¨ Mr. Barra said.
¡§Chinese companies are held to a higher standard than other companies out there.¡¨

WSJ.D Technology: Samsung's Primacy Is Tested By Rise of Chinese Players
By Jonathan Cheng

SHANGHAI -- Samsung Electronics Co.'s attempt to stay on top of the fast-changing smartphone business will depend on winning back people like He Wenzong.
The 30-year-old apparel-company employee and Shanghai resident last year traded his Galaxy S3 phone, one of Samsung's most successful products, for a handset made by Beijing-based upstart Xiaomi Inc., which a few months ago displaced Samsung as China's No. 1 smartphone seller.
Xiaomi's phone offers better software and services, Mr. He says, at a fraction of a new Samsung's price. "To me, it looks like it's the same quality, but one costs 2,000 yuan ($327) and the other is 3,500 yuan," says Mr. He. "So why would I pick Samsung?"
Across China -- and around the globe -- other people are starting to feel the same way. Samsung has lost its top position for mobile-phone sales in India, and research firms that track smartphone shipments say it is in danger of being toppled in Thailand and the Philippines. Though Samsung is still the No. 1 smartphone maker globally, it has been losing market share in recent quarters.
In China, where Samsung gets 18% of its total sales, the company is parachuting in executives and outside consultants to assess the problem and figure out how to fix it, according to people with knowledge of the moves. The company is lowering prices for its existing handsets by up to 20% and preparing to roll out a new, cheaper line of smartphones for emerging markets, the people said.
The steps are part of a larger attempt to shore up the mobile-phone division, which accounts for around 60% of Samsung's operating profit.
On Thursday, the company is expected to report that operating profit for the quarter ended in September has fallen by about 60% from a year earlier, following a 20% decline in the quarter before, largely because of what the company acknowledged was "increased competition" in China.
After leading sales in the Chinese smartphone market every quarter for the past two-and-a-half years, Samsung dropped behind Xiaomi during the quarter ended June, tying for second place with Lenovo Group Ltd. and Coolpad Group Ltd., according to data tracker Canalys.
Samsung has cut the bonuses of hundreds of managers in its mobile division, according to people familiar with the matter. In an attempt to streamline operations, Samsung is combining many of its main business divisions in the U.S. under one chief, say people with direct knowledge of the move. That could foreshadow a similar consolidation of leadership at headquarters, where the company is run by three co-chief executives, said one of these people.
In an attempt to bring down its manufacturing costs, Samsung opened a $2 billion mobile-phone factory in Vietnam last year, and in July won approval from Vietnamese authorities for another factory to produce smartphone and tablet displays.
A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment on its China strategy or personnel moves.
Samsung began building up extensive distribution networks to sell its televisions and mobile phones in the 1990s, giving it a sizable head start versus Apple when it began roll out high-end smartphones. Since most Chinese consumers buy their phones at mobile-phone or consumer-electronics retail outlets rather than through carriers, Samsung's network of stores let it reach consumers from small villages to big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
Recently, however, more Chinese consumers are buying phones online, and many of Samsung's Chinese rivals, like Xiaomi, sell primarily that way, which also lowers their overhead. Xiaomi sells its handsets at close to cost, aiming to make money on software and services sold over the phones instead -- a tactic that lets it undercut Samsung prices.
Samsung's Chinese rivals run Google Inc.'s Android operating system -- like the vast majority of Samsung's smartphones. But they have been more efficient at pre-loading sales-generating apps on their phones and promoting their own app stores.
Samsung, by its own admission, has been slow to respond. The company kept its prices high, even on lower-tier smartphones.
To unload excess inventory, Samsung has lowered some smartphone prices in China by between 10% and 20%, a tactic that could help it recapture some market share in the second half of the year, Canalys says.
The company is also preparing to release -- initially in China -- a new line of smartphones dubbed Galaxy A, a midrange phone that offers many of the features of a high-end Galaxy S device but is priced more competitively with Chinese phones, according to people familiar with the plans.

Jaguar Land Rover Opens
Its First Plant in China
Tata Motors Ltd.'s Jaguar Land Rover opened its first plant in China on Tuesday as part of a manufacturing push there, even as it sees moderating growth in luxury-car sales in the country.
The luxury-car maker said the factory will have a capacity of 130,000 cars and produce three models by 2016, including one Jaguar model, along with Chinese partner Chery Automobile Co. The first model to roll off the line will be the luxury Range Rover Evoque sport-utility vehicle, its most popular in China.
The plant is in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu, about 100 kilometers north of Shanghai. It is part of a 10.9 billion yuan ($1.78 billion) investment to bolster the auto maker's brands in the world's largest auto market.

Handset Maker Weighs
Manufacturing in India
Xiaomi Inc., China's best-selling cellphone maker, is thinking of manufacturing its handsets in India.
The company just started selling its phones in India in July. Its early sales figures have been strong enough that it is already considering manufacturing in India, said Manu Jain, the head of Xiaomi's Indian arm.
"We always thought that our manufacturing would be based out of China," Mr. Jain said. "But India is beginning to become so important for us that we started to think whether we should set up our own manufacturing."

China¡¦s Xiaomi May Make Cellphones in India; Xiaomi Has Hired Legal Advisers to Investigate the Regulatory Aspects of Manufacturing in India

BANGALORE, India¡XXiaomi Inc., China¡¦s best-selling cellphone maker, is thinking of manufacturing its handsets in India.
The company¡Xwhich sells more smartphones than even Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. in China¡Xjust started selling its phones in India in July. Its early sales figures have been strong enough that it is already considering manufacturing in Asia¡¦s third-largest economy, said Manu Jain, the head of Xiaomi¡¦s Indian arm.
¡§We always thought that our manufacturing would be based out of China,¡¨ Mr. Jain said. ¡§But India is beginning to become so important for us that we started to think whether we should set up our own manufacturing.¡¨
Mr. Jain said it would take at least six months before Xiaomi can decide whether making handsets in India makes sense.
Earlier this month Nokia Corp. decided to suspend manufacturing at its cellphone factory in southern India amid a continuing dispute with the country¡¦s tax authorities. The tax battle prevented Nokia from selling the plant¡Xonce one of the Finnish company¡¦s largest factories¡Xto Microsoft Corp.
Xiaomi has hired legal advisers to investigate the regulatory aspects of manufacturing in India, said Mr. Jain.
Xiaomi has been making waves in the India cellphone market using sudden online sales and high-end handsets priced close to cost. In its four months in India, Xiaomi has already sold more than 500,000 phones in India.
That is still only a small slice of the market in India where more than 200 million cellphones are sold each year, making it the world¡¦s second largest market after China¡¦s.
While only around one fifth of the new phones sold in India are smartphones, Mr. Jain expects smartphones to account for a majority of the phones sold in the South Asian nation the next three years.

WSJ.D Technology: Phone Parts for China Lift Makers From Japan

(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   
KYOTO, Japan -- China's smartphone boom is being fueled by an unlikely source: Japanese parts makers.
Upstart Chinese phone makers like Xiaomi Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. are increasingly undercutting smartphone giants like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. with high-performance, low-cost handsets.
A significant portion of those handsets' guts -- as much as 50% by value, in some cases -- is made by Japanese companies like Murata Manufacturing Co. or TDK Corp. Those parts range from displays and Wi-Fi modules to tiny, energy-storing ceramic capacitors.
"Almost all cellphone manufacturers are our customers," said Tsuneo Murata, president of Murata, which makes capacitors and other components. "The pie for the component demand is growing."
The parts sales are a rare bright spot in Japan's gloomy electronics industry, and China's smartphone market -- the world's largest and growing at 19% a year, according to Counterpoint Research -- is a big factor. Sales there are being fueled by cutthroat competition among dozens of brands, some of which offer smartphones at less than $100. Lower prices mean smaller budgets for parts, but Japanese suppliers often provide a larger share of components to Chinese brands than to Apple or Samsung, analysts say.
In the second quarter of this year, Xiaomi leapfrogged Apple and Samsung to become the best-selling smartphone provider in China, says research firm Canalys. Counterpoint says Chinese brands will capture about three-quarters of the domestic market this year, in terms of volume, up from one-third in 2010.
Chinese companies are boosting purchases of Japanese parts as they push beyond the domestic market, in order to upgrade their phones.
In some Chinese-branded phones, Japanese suppliers provide up to half of the parts by value, said Daiki Takayama, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Another Chinese smartphone maker, ZTE Corp., buys displays from Sharp Corp. of Japan for its high-end phones, along with camera modules from Sony Corp., said Lu Qianhao, head of ZTE's handset marketing strategy. He cited technological know-how and quality control as advantages of Japanese suppliers.
By contrast, Japanese suppliers account for about one-third of the bill of materials for the latest iPhones, and less than that for Samsung phones, said Shoji Sato, an analyst at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.
Even phone-screen maker Japan Display Inc., whose shares sank last week after it predicted a loss this fiscal year because of delays in shipments to Apple, says it expects sales to Chinese smartphone makers to nearly triple to <yen>180 billion ($1.68 billion) during the same period.
Japan Display makes liquid-crystal displays for smartphones and tablet computers, one of the most competitive areas in the parts business, in which rivals like LG Display Co. of South Korea have been making inroads. Suppliers like Murata that dominate hard-to-copy niches are doing better.
Murata, which is based in Kyoto, built on a long tradition of ceramics-making to hone its specialization in capacitors and related components.
The company's latest capacitors aren't much bigger than a grain of sand, but they contain about 100 layers of ceramics, and Murata uses proprietary methods to make them.
"It's like making a good mille-feuille,"" Mr. Takayama said. "You can buy a very high-quality egg, the best vanilla essence or whatever, but nobody else knows how to mix it or how long to bake it."
Because Murata is the world's largest supplier of capacitors for phones, with a 35% share, it can assure manufacturers of a reliable supply, analysts say. That is important given the tight schedules of the smartphone business.
Capacitors cost pennies or less, but state-of-the-art handsets contain 700 to 800 of them -- three or four times as many as in previous generations of smartphones, Murata says.
Mr. Sato estimated Murata sells $2 to $3 worth of parts to most Chinese smartphone makers per handset. Given that Xiaomi alone has forecast shipments of 60 million phones in 2014 and 100 million next year, that is a solid source of revenue. Apple buys $9 to $10 worth of Murata parts for each iPhone, Mr. Sato estimated.
Murata's sales of parts to smartphone makers and other suppliers of communications gear rose about 90% over the past five years, to 430 billion yen in the year ended March 31, boosting overall sales by about 60%, to 847 billion yen.
The Kyoto area, also home to parts makers like Rohm Semiconductor, Nidec Corp. and Kyocera Corp., has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Chinese smartphone boom. TDK, which is based in Tokyo and makes capacitors and other parts, says its sales to Chinese smartphone makers rose 50% in the April-June quarter.
The push to automate smartphone plants in China is providing a further boost to Japanese suppliers. Fanuc Corp., a maker of industrial robots that is based in the shadow of Mount Fuji, in September upgraded its forecast for sales and earnings in the financial year ending in March by 29% and 26%, respectively.

Lenovo to Establish New Mobile Phone Company in China; Smartphone Company With Different Brand Name Is Part of Efforts to Fend Off Competition in China

Personal-computer and smartphone maker Lenovo Group Ltd. said it would create a new company in China next year that focuses on selling mobile phones online.
The new smartphone company, which will have a different brand name, is part of Lenovo¡¦s efforts to fend off fierce competition in China from Xiaomi Inc., a local smartphone startup that sells its handsets online while cultivating its fan base through its own software, services and entertainment offerings. Xiaomi is also known for being marketing savvy, engaging with consumers through online forums and social networks.
Lenovo said in a statement Wednesday that it will continue to sell Lenovo-branded phones in China through local carriers and retailers.
The new smartphone company, which will start its operation April 1, 2015, won't only sell devices online but will also offer applications and focus on consumer engagement, Lenovo said.
Lenovo, which last year overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. as the world¡¦s largest PC maker, has been quickly expanding its smartphone business for the past year. In the second quarter, Lenovo was the world¡¦s fourth-largest smartphone maker by shipments behind Samsung, Apple and Huawei Technologies Co., according to IDC.
Lenovo and Xiaomi are two of the biggest smartphone makers in China, both selling more phones in the market than Samsung Electronics Co. or Apple Inc.
In recent quarters, Lenovo and Xiaomi have been competing intensely against each other for the number-one position by shipments.
Lenovo¡¦s plans to set up a new mobile phone business comes as the company is in the process of completing a $2.91 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in the U.S.
But Lenovo said that the new smartphone company will be a China-focused company.

Xiaomi Inc., the Chinese smartphone maker that has overtaken Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in the world's biggest smartphone market, has hired another former Google Inc. executive, this time to lead its products team in India.
Jai Mani, who joins as lead product manager, was strategy and analytics associate for Google Play and co-founded a startup, according to his LinkedIn profile, before relocating from San Francisco.
"You can think of it as the beginning of our R&D center development in India," Hugo Barra, vice president for global operations at Xiaomi, said.
"The first person we hired is someone who's going to be the glue between our users in India, product feedback that we receive, and the engineering team we have in Beijing as well as the engineering team that we are going to be building fairly soon in India," he said.
Mr. Barra, who also joined Xiaomi from Google, said he and Mr. Mani "worked very closely at Google."
The appointment comes as Xiaomi is expanding outside of China and ramping up its presence in India and Southeast Asia. The Chinese company wants to build products or applications that run on its cellphones aimed at a global audience from India, Mr. Barra told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. Xiaomi, which means "little rice" in Chinese, has intensified competition in a smartphone market dominated by Apple and Samsung. Xiaomi has created buzz in China and India by selling high-end phones online directly to consumers for prices that are close to cost. The company offers services such as mobile applications and movies via its software and makes money by selling an array of accessories. Mr. Mani worked with Google from 2009 until 2013.

WSJ.D Technology: HTC Takes New Look at Itself With Selfie Camera

TAIPEI -- While working on a product road map for smartphone maker HTC Corp. earlier this year, company Vice President Jerry Hsiao did some research.
"British women spend a month of their lives taking selfies," read an article from the British tabloid the Daily Mail that Mr. Hsiao selected for a PowerPoint slideshow highlighting his findings.
While Mr. Hsiao had included the article jokingly in a presentation this week about new products from the Taiwanese company, the observation holds true that people today are often endlessly fascinated with their own images refracted through high-tech gadgets. And long-suffering HTC is hoping that tendency will help it engineer a turnaround.
On Wednesday in New York, HTC, once the world's top smartphone maker by volume in 2011, launched a waterproof action camera and software for taking selfie photos, a departure from its usual emphasis on mobile-phone hardware. HTC also unveiled a selfie-focused smartphone to bolster the company's midprice Desire line.
It is a strategic change that the company hopes will help it reverse three years of falling sales. Last year, HTC fell out of the world's top 10 smartphone brands by shipments amid branding weakness and strong competition from Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea in the high-end market and Chinese rivals such as Xiaomi in the low-cost segment. This month, the company said its third-quarter revenue fell 11% to 41.86 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$1.37 billion), compared with NT$47 billion a year earlier, despite returning to a net profit largely on cost cuts.
Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said in an interview that the company hopes its new products will help it return to sales growth. HTC's sales have fallen year-over-year for the past 12 quarters.
HTC's $199 Re Camera is a slim tube-shaped camera that can be clipped to a backpack, mounted on a bicycle or taken underwater. It is the company's first major venture outside smartphones since its launch of a tablet computer three years ago, and will be sold on Amazon.com and through other retailers. The camera weighs about 2.5 ounces.
Chairwoman Cher Wang has blamed marketing weakness for HTC's decline. Its third marketing chief in two years left HTC this fall, after an advertising campaign with actor Robert Downey Jr. failed to stem the company's sales slide.
In an interview, Ms. Wang said HTC is looking to invest its marketing dollars more effectively. "The most important thing is to make the end-user love you," she said.
The smartphone maker released its Zoe slideshow app free for devices powered by Google Inc.'s Android software and Apple Inc.'s iOS. Its new selfie app, HTC Eye, offers voice-activated photo-taking and a video-chat feature that keeps a subject's face centered in the screen even if the person is walking around. The company plans to eventually make the selfie app available free of charge for non-HTC users.
HTC plans to offer the new smartphone, called Desire Eye, through AT&T Inc. later this month. Unsubsidized, the smartphone would cost between US$450 and US$500, Mr. Chang said. It comes with 13-megapixel cameras on both the front and rear and has a 5.2-inch screen.
A number of competitors await HTC in the selfie-smartphone niche. Samsung, Sony Corp. of Japan and others have also rolled out smartphones with features intended to make it easier to take and edit selfie photos.
With the Re camera, HTC will have to vie against other action-camera makers, such as GoPro Inc. of San Mateo, Calif.

HTC Posts Second Straight Quarterly Profit; Sales Continue to Slide as Smartphone Maker Loses Market Share to Apple and Low-Cost Chinese Competitors

TAIPEI¡XHTC Corp. said Friday it was profitable for a second consecutive quarter, but the company continued a three-year revenue decline as competition from low-priced Chinese phone makers remains fierce.
The Taiwanese smartphone maker has spent the past year cutting costs and diversifying from its high-end flagship line, after falling into the red last year for the first time since its public listing in 2002.
While the cost cuts have returned HTC to a narrow profit, it has yet to find a way to reverse the slide in sales. HTC has lost share to market leaders like Apple Inc. and to rapidly growing low-cost Chinese rivals like Xiaomi.
The company has rolled out more midtier phones this year, but those new devices have yet to offset the decline in sales of its flagship HTC One line.
HTC executives have said they plan to expand into other product categories this year to try to revive the business. The company sent invitations for a launch event on Oct. 8, with a teaser video that suggests it will release an action camera that can be used while playing sports or swimming.
The company is also joining with Google Inc. to release a Nexus tablet, which will be HTC¡¦s first tablet in three years, according to people familiar with the matter. These new devices could help offset declining sales in HTC¡¦s smartphone business, analysts say.
HTC said its preliminary third-quarter earnings were 640 million New Taiwan dollars (US$21 million), above analyst expectations of NT$556.8 million, according to Thomson One Analytics. That compares with a net loss of NT$2.97 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
In the quarter ended Sept. 30, HTC posted NT$41.86 billion in revenue, down from NT$47 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
In the fourth quarter, HTC will face strong competition from Apple, which announced on Sept. 22 it sold a record 10 million of its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones in their first weekend of sales.

New iPhones Cleared For Chinese Market

HONG KONG -- Apple Inc.'s new iPhone 6 will go on sale in China on Oct. 17 after winning final approval from regulators who scrutinized the device's security features amid rising concerns in the country about privacy.
The move brings the iPhone 6 and the big-screen iPhone 6 Plus to China roughly one month after they went on sale in the U.S. and other countries. Apple is counting on the devices to help it maintain its edge in China, the world's largest smartphone market but an increasingly tough battleground for both foreign and domestic companies.
China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the network-access licenses to Apple's new iPhones after the Cupertino, Calif., company addressed the privacy risks found in a government agency's safety test, the regulator said Tuesday.
The ministry's concerns included software that it feared could be used to allow third parties to get access to user data.
Asked about the ministry's concerns, an Apple spokeswoman pointed to the company's online statements on user privacy. She declined to answer additional questions.
Apple's iPhones and other mobile gadgets are under increased scrutiny from governments amid concerns over privacy. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that U.S. and foreign law-enforcement agencies used software to turn Internet-connected devices, such as laptops and smartphones, into digital eavesdropping posts. Such programs often are created and installed without the device manufacturer's knowledge.
Still, China's approval gives Apple access to a country of more than 1.2 billion mobile users. Apple said Tuesday that the phones would be available on China's three large state-owned mobile carriers. It said it would allow preorders to begin Oct. 10.
The ministry conducted the safety test after recent media reports raised privacy concerns over iPhones. In July, state-run China Central Television said the iPhone poses a national security concern because of a feature that determines places a user visits most frequently. Apple said that users must switch on that feature themselves and the company doesn't keep track of the locations.
Specifically, Chinese authorities said they scrutinized what they called back-end programs that could allow covert data collection. It said the risks include third parties getting access to the phone through the Internet via a desktop or laptop computer the phone might be connected to.
In response, Apple said that the new version of the phone's mobile operating software allowed users to clear the list of computers authorized to connect to the phone, according to the ministry. It added that Apple said the company can't get access to users' information without their consent.
Apple also told the regulator that it "has stepped up the protection for users' privacy and safety," according to the ministry. The U.S. company also reiterated that it has never worked with any government agency from any country to create a "backdoor" in any of its products or services and it never will, according to MIIT.
The delay in China highlighted the challenge Apple faces in expanding its presence in a major growth market. Apple ranked No. 6 in China's smartphone market in the second quarter, with a market share of 6.5%, according to research firm IDC.
Apple has faced increasing competition from rival Samsung Electronics Co. and Chinese manufacturers including Xiaomi Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., which offer phones with advanced hardware at budget prices.
In the second quarter, Apple ranked second after Samsung in the global smartphone market.
Apple's market share fell to 11.7% from 13% a year earlier, while Samsung's dropped to 24.9% from 32.2%. No. 3 Huawei's market share rose to 6.7% from 5.1%, according to IDC.

Corporate News: Taiwan Considers Limits On Use of Xiaomi Phones

TAIPEI -- Taiwan is debating whether to prohibit government officials from using phones produced by Xiaomi Inc., China's biggest smartphone maker, amid burgeoning concern over the protection of users' privacy by Chinese tech firms.
"Recent reports and speculations over the security of Xiaomi phones has prompted us to look into the matter," government spokesman Sun Lih-chyun said Wednesday. The government will make a decision in three months.
Xiaomi declined to comment directly on Taiwan's possible ban but reiterated its earlier statement that the new upgraded software system is sufficient to block any transferring or collection of personal information without prior authorization from users.
The possible ban is also a reflection of Taiwan's wariness of China, despite the strengthening of bilateral trade links. According to Taiwan's National Security Bureau, the island encountered more than 30,000 hacking attempts during the first half of this year, with a portion suspected to be from Internet protocol addresses in China.
To beef up Taiwan's cyberdefense, Mr. Sun said non-Taiwanese instant-messaging applications, including LINE, WhatsApp, Facebook and WeChat, aren't allowed to be installed on government issued electronic devices. Government workers are also asked not to discuss work-related matters over those platforms, he added. Instead, government staff have been asked to communicate via Juiker, a homegrown instant-messaging application created by the government-funded Industrial Technology Research Institute.
Mr. Sun said because servers of these foreign chat platforms are located in other countries, "in cases of cybersecurity breach or data theft, it will be difficult for our police to investigate."
Tencent Holdings Ltd., the Chinese maker of WeChat, couldn't be reached for comment.
Competitive pricing by Chinese telecom and mobile-phone companies has bolstered their global market access, but they are also facing harsher scrutiny from foreign governments amid escalating concerns over cyberattacks and digital espionage allegedly stemming from China.
In 2012, the U.S. government flagged Chinese telecommunication giants Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE as potential national security threats, saying in a report that equipment produced by these two firms could be use to compromise American cybersecurity. Vehement accusations of trespassing each other's cyberspace remain a strain on Sino-U.S. ties. In August, Singapore said it would launch a probe into Xiaomi on possible data theft after complaints about the Chinese company's alleged unauthorized transmission of users' personal information to a server in Beijing.

Joint Venture to Cut
700 Jobs in Australia
Several of Australia's largest coal companies are intensifying job cutbacks, despite signs of an upturn for the commodity.
BHP Billiton and Mitsubishi Corp.'s Australian joint venture¡Xthe world's biggest exporter of coal to make steel¡Xsaid on Tuesday it would cut jobs, citing a sustained weakness in prices.
The companies said they would shed about 700 jobs from their Australian coal-mining operations in central Queensland as they deepen a cost-cutting drive that has been going on for more than 18 months. The BHP-Mitsubishi alliance employs about 7,000 people in Queensland's Bowen Basin, which includes two operations it operates with Mitsui & Co.
New Hope Corp., one of Australia's largest coal miners, also is shedding jobs. Chief Executive Shane Stephan said on Tuesday that the company had cut 45 jobs in recent months.

Crest Whitestrips Maker Wins Infringement Suit
Procter & Gamble Co. won a victory in its fight to protect its Crest Whitestrips from generic competition, potentially driving one of its few remaining rivals out of the market.
The consumer-products giant said Tuesday that a federal court in Ohio found the tooth whitening strips produced by Clio USA, a small manufacturer that has supplied generic strips to stores including CVS Health Corp. and Family Dollar Stores Inc., infringed on three of P&G's patents.
Tim Barrett, an analyst with Euromonitor International, said the court's decision will likely force Clio to leave the market that Crest has vigorously defended.
A representative from Clio didn't respond to requests for comment.

Regulators Approve Operations in China
NetJets Inc. said it has become the first Western private-jet operator to secure permission from regulators in China to operate flights within that country, though airspace restrictions will limit the services it can offer.
The Columbus, Ohio, unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Tuesday that it initially will offer charter flights in China with two planes. It hopes to win approval by early next year to also take on the management of jets owned by companies and wealthy individuals in the country.
Private-jet use in China is growing rapidly, with aircraft manufacturers and operators targeting the region's emerging superrich and corporate elites.
However, NetJets Chief Executive Jordan Hansell said on a call with reporters that it can still take one to two days to secure permission from regulators for flight plans and other clearances, even though Chinese regulators have been opening more military airspace to commercial flying. The complications reduce the flexibility and appeal of private jets.

Xbox One Release Pushed Back to Sept. 29 in China
The Xbox One has a China release date. Again.
Microsoft Corp. said that its new game console will go on sale in the world's No. 2 economy on Sept. 29. The disclosure comes after the Redmond, Wash., technology giant over the weekend pulled the plug on its initial Sept. 23 launch date.
"After receiving government approval for the first wave of games, we will launch with the first 10 games now and continue our work to bring more blockbuster games and a broad offering of entertainment and app experiences to the platform in the weeks and months to come," said Enwei Xie, general manager of Xbox China.
Asked why the console was delayed, a Microsoft spokeswoman said, "we wanted to launch with the first approved game titles right away." She didn't immediately respond to questions about whether the games were delayed.
The Xbox One would become the first game console to be legally sold in China in more than a decade.
Pricing could be a challenge. Microsoft said it plans to sell the Xbox One with the Kinect motion detection system for 4,299 yuan ($700), roughly 40% more than in the U.S.

IPO Puts CEO Atop List
Alibaba's blockbuster $25 billion stock offering has made Jack Ma the wealthiest man in China, according to a new survey, as investor enthusiasm for Chinese technology names enriches a new generation of Internet moguls.
Mr. Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and his family have a net worth of about $25 billion following last week's initial public offering, according to the Hurun Rich List, an annual survey compiled by the Shanghai-based research group Hurun Report and released on Tuesday. That puts him at the top of a list long dominated by property magnates. An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment.
Half of this year's top 10 were technology executives, including the top executives at Internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd., search engine provider Baidu Inc., e-commerce website JD.com Inc. and smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. Only two major property investors made the list amid a swooning Chinese real-estate market.

China's Richest: Jack Ma

Alibaba's blockbuster $25 billion stock offering has made Jack Ma the wealthiest man in China, according to a new survey, as investor enthusiasm for Chinese technology names enriches a new generation of Internet moguls.
Mr. Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and his family have a net worth of about $25 billion following last week's initial public offering, according to the Hurun Rich List, an annual survey compiled by the Shanghai-based research group Hurun Report and released on Tuesday. That puts him at the top of a list long dominated by property magnates. An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment.
Half of this year's top 10 were technology executives, including the top executives at Internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd., search engine provider Baidu Inc., e-commerce website JD.com Inc. and smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. Only two major property investors made the list amid a swooning Chinese real-estate market.
The shift reflects a flood of dollars into China's rapidly growing Internet sector, as investors bet on firms such as Alibaba growing at a fast clip at home and becoming more globally competitive. China has seen a record 15 Internet IPOs so far this year, according to data provider Dealogic, raising $29.2 billion, including Alibaba's $25 billion. By contrast, the four Chinese Internet IPOs over the same period last year raised a combined $91 million.
"This IT boom has really taken off in the last year, when Chinese players seem to be bringing bigger ideas to market," said Hurun founder Rupert Hoogewerf.
Rui Ma, a Greater China partner with venture-capital investor 500 Startups, said the flood of new money into China's IT sector this year has come both from foreign investors excited about the rapid growth of the likes of Alibaba and from domestic investors looking for a place to put their money as yields fall in real estate and manufacturing.
"Those in traditional industries have really seen a hit to their wealth from the general slowdown," she said, adding that she has seen startup valuations in Beijing pass those of Silicon Valley this year. "A lot of wealthy Chinese are turning to tech for investing."
In a recent interview, Joseph Chen, chairman and chief executive of Chinese social-media company Renren Inc., called the startup market in China "very fluffy," though he said the subsequent IPOs by many of those new companies often justified the values.
Shares of Tencent and Baidu are both up more than 40% over the past 12 months. Tencent founder Pony Ma was No. 5 on the list with wealth of $18.1 billion, while Baidu founder Robin Li was No. 6 with $17.5 billion. They companies didn't respond to requests for comment.
In May, the IPO of online retailer JD.com Inc. jumped 20% when it began trading, giving the company a market value of $28 billion. JD.com founder Richard Liu is China's ninth richest person with $8.8 billion, Hurun said. "International investors appreciate the transformational effects that e-commerce is having in China," JD.com spokesman Josh Gartner said.
The Hurun list valued Mr. Ma's wealth based on both his minority stake in Alibaba and his stake in the company's electronic-payment affiliate Alipay.
Mr. Ma edged out No. 2 Wang Jianlin, chairman of real-estate developer and entertainment company Dalian Wanda Group Corp. Wanda didn't respond to a request for comment.

In May, the IPO of online retailer JD.com jumped 20% when it began trading, giving the company a market value of $28 billion. JD.com founder Richard Liu is China's ninth richest person with wealth of $8.8 billion, Hurun said. "International investors appreciate the transformational effects that e-commerce is having in China," JD.com spokesman Josh Gartner said.
Closely held Xiaomi, which makes high-spec smartphones for budget prices, was valued at $10 billion last year based on its fundraising efforts. Xiaomi founder Lei Jun was No. 10 with wealth of $7.5 billion, Hurun said. Xiaomi declined to comment.
The Hurun list valued Mr. Ma's wealth including both his minority stake in Alibaba and his stake in the company's electronic-payment affiliate Alipay.
He edged out No. 2 Wang Jianlin, chairman of real-estate developer and entertainment company Dalian Wanda Group Corp. Wanda didn't respond to a request for comment.
The last time an Internet entrepreneur rose to the top of Hurun's rich list was in 2003, with Netease founder Ding Lei, Mr. Hoogewerf said. Since then, the crown of China's richest man has passed to executives in other sectors such as real estate, beverages and heavy manufacturing.

WSJ.D Technology: How Startups View Alibaba as an Active Investor

Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. is more than an enormous e-commerce conglomerate that just held history's biggest IPO. It's also an increasingly active investor in startups with the ability to influence its portfolio companies' business models and strategies, entrepreneurs say.
The company has backed 12 startups, raising a combined total of more than $1 billion so far this year, up from three startups that raised a combined $22 million in 2009, according to industry tracker DowJones VentureSource.
Among its total of 27 technology investments since the beginning of 2009, Alibaba this year invested $215 million in the messaging platform TangoMe Inc. and took part in a $250 million financing round for ride-sharing service Lyft Inc. The financing rounds were among the largest Alibaba has joined as an investor.
Entrepreneurs whose companies are backed by Alibaba say the company consistently counsels them to forgo short-term revenue goals for longer-term strategies.
Peel Technologies Inc., a Mountain View, Calif.-based company that enables smartphones to be used as remote controls, raised an undisclosed amount from Alibaba in June. Around that time it was considering hiring a vice president of monetization to boost advertising revenue, according to Peel Chief Executive Thiru Arunachalam. He held off in part because Hongping Zhang, Alibaba Capital Partners managing director and a Peel board member, encouraged him to reconsider.
"He said, 'Don't worry about the revenue, focus on the user base,'" Mr. Arunachalam said, referring to Mr. Zhang. "He said, 'Let's get to one billion users; then we'll be in a better position'" to monetize. "They are a very different type of investor," Mr. Arunachalam added. "They are in it for the long haul."
That strategy has worked well for Alibaba. The Chinese e-commerce giant steadily expanded its user base during the past decade by diversifying from shopping to include payment, messaging, cloud computing and entertainment services.
Transactions on its e-commerce sites totaled $248 billion last year, or more than those for eBay and Amazon combined. It has also sought to back startups in a wide variety of sectors with future strategic value for Alibaba.
Last year, Alibaba led a $50 million financing round in Quixey Inc., another Mountain View-based company that is building deep-linking technology to improve mobile search. The technology would enable consumers to search for information on their mobile devices the way they do on desktops, without having to download or launch individual apps to get the specific data. Consumers could also shop and take other actions within various Alibaba apps without ever downloading them from app stores.
Among Quixey's challenges around the time of the financing was balancing the need for immediate revenue with more strategic thinking. "Certain investors tried to pressure us into short-term monetization like 'the app of the day,'" said Quixey Chief Executive Tomer Kagan. "It seems like a short-term win but it can actually derail the focus, and so it's good to have a board meeting when Alibaba reminds us" of that, he said. "They support the idea of not going for the short-term wins when the long-term wins can be earth-shattering."
Kabam Inc. Chief Operating Officer Kent Wakeford said that working with Alibaba executives has been "eye opening." The free-to-play mobile-game startup raised $120 million from Alibaba in July in a deal that included publishing and distributing games. Like Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu Inc. and others that are building game portfolios, Alibaba sees mobile games as a way to continue to build its user base and keep it engaged.
Conversations with Alibaba also included the possibility of leveraging Kabam's intellectual-property deals with Hollywood franchises like "The Hunger Games" and "Lord of the Rings."
"They are seeking to provide 360-degree touch points with consumers," said Mr. Wakeford, adding that this could include playing movie trailers, as well as options to purchase movie tickets and buy related merchandise while a user is playing a game.
Having a patient, deep-pocketed strategic investor has its benefits, but it can also make partnering with Alibaba competitors more difficult. Peel's Mr. Arunachalam said his team is sensitive to what he calls a "perception challenge" when meeting with potential Chinese partners like Baidu, Tencent and electronics company Xiaomi Inc.
While he doesn't omit the fact that Peel is backed by Alibaba, his team doesn't emphasize it either. "Some people use the 'Ali company' as a business card," he said. "We don't."

Managing -- Boss Talk Asia: Renren Seeks China's Next Innovation --- Social Media Firm's CEO, Joseph Chen, Discusses the Entrepreneurial Spirit in the Chinese Internet Sector

BEIJING -- Joseph Chen is seeking China's next innovation.
The 44-year-old U.S.-educated entrepreneur is the founder of Renren Inc., a Chinese social-media service. To counter larger rivals such as Weibo Corp. and WeChat mobile-app owner Tencent Holdings Ltd., Mr. Chen is guiding U.S.-traded Renren toward fast-growing parts of China's Internet business, such as mobile games and online video. He has also made well-timed bets on successful startups such as Vipshop Holdings Ltd., a group-buying company that squeezes discounts out of retailers in exchange for groups of customers. Mr. Chen directed Renren to invest in Social Finance Inc., a U.S. company that uses peer-to-peer lending to fund student loans.
Mr. Chen, a history buff and self-declared binge watcher of Western television shows, spoke to The Wall Street Journal recently about the state of China's innovation.
Edited excerpts:
WSJ: How does the state of innovation in China compare with Silicon Valley?
Mr. Chen: The Silicon Valleys of the world need two essentials. One is economic opportunity. The other is a good lifestyle. I think it is really difficult to beat Silicon Valley in both. Silicon Valley -- with Apple, Google based there -- built an ecosystem of smart people who come in, love the place and stayed close, and the money there stayed there.
WSJ: The Chinese Internet is increasingly dominated by three companies -- Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. How does that impact innovation?
Mr. Chen: It's very difficult to compete with them in the same space. So that is partially why you have [handset maker] Xiaomi [Inc.]. The CEO, Lei Jun, is a classmate of mine, a capable guy. When he was trying to start a new company, he probably realized that, on the Internet, it is too difficult. So he picked another area.
The dominance of the companies in the application layer will force innovation to happen in other layers. Even if you innovate in that layer you won't make too much money. You need to find another layer to innovate and disrupt. Fortunately the rapid rise of Android and the natural evolution of handsets and smartphones created a huge marketplace.
WSJ: Which companies should we look at in terms of Chinese innovation?
Mr. Chen: Entrepreneurs are increasingly looking to disrupt traditional industries, where the big networks of the major Internet companies have less influence. I'm thinking about O2O -- online to offline -- for a new class of business.
You have to be willing to do something that the big guys aren't willing to go to the trouble to do. Like in the early days of group buying. Nobody knew that group buying would be so big, so the big players, they didn't do it. It is too much work. You have to rent out thousands of sales forces on the ground to knock on the door of the local vendors and hustle.
WSJ: What's the difference between startups in China and startups in the U.S. and elsewhere?
Mr. Chen: Startups in the U.S. definitely have a more relaxed time than Chinese startups. Venture capital in the U.S. seems more conservative in that they don't like to fund copycats. We invested in SoFi, which is successful, but there are only a few serious competitors. If this same market happened in China, you would have 100 players. Discipline in the supply side of capital I think is there [in the U.S.]. They don't fund too many competitors in the same space. As a result of that, the U.S. startup guys don't need to be as paranoid as their Chinese counterparts, who worry about hundreds of competitors.
WSJ: Is there a risk to China's oversupply of capital?
Mr. Chen: The history of risk-taking in this country is short compared with U.S. and Europe. I think the ability to assess risk to a society can be learned only through up and downs in the market. There will be bubbles burst, and I think society has to go through multiple cycles of that to get a good handle on how to calculate risk.
The China capital markets are so new, so you need multiple cycles of boom and bust. Right now you can't say there is an oversupply, because if you calculate venture capital returns from IPOs, it is probably a good return. Based on history things don't look so bad, but the past is never a safe predictor of the future.
WSJ: What kind of Chinese tech company might go global?
Mr. Chen: For the consumer space I tend to think hardware companies have a better chance historically. You look at Toyota and Samsung. Those are hardware companies coming out of Japan and Korea. If China wants to become a technology powerhouse, it should look at Korea and look at Japan.
WSJ: What do you look for in investments?
Mr. Chen: If you want to build a great, large Internet-based business you want to identify a large, slow-moving, inefficient competitor. Who are Vipshop's competitors? They are small, mom-and-pop apparel shops lined up on the commercial streets of the third-tier, fourth-tier, fifth-tier cities. You go into the store and they have nothing to offer other than convenience. They don't have the selection, they don't have the brand. These are the ideal competitors to have. You want to compete with tens of millions of disorganized individual fighters, farmers with broken down guns, rather than with one elite Roman army.

WSJ.D Technology: China Will Have to Wait for New iPhones

China is one of Apple Inc.'s biggest markets by sales and a major driver of its revenue growth. But when it comes to its new iPhones, the country will have to wait, highlighting the difficulties the technology giant faces in getting its China strategy right.
While Apple this week said its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus would go on sale beginning Sept. 19 in the U.S. and some European and Asian markets, including Hong Kong, it didn't list China as one of countries where they would be immediately available.
It's a change from when Apple launched the iPhone 5S last year and the device was available in China at the same time as it arrived in U.S. stores.
Apple's Beijing-based spokeswoman declined to comment on the reason for the delay this time. She said the company sees China as a key market and is trying to get the new iPhones there as soon as possible.
In China, Apple has faced increasing competition from rival Samsung Electronics Co. and local manufacturers such as Xiaomi Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd.

Delayed iPhones Highlight Apple's China Challenges

China is one of Apple Inc.'s biggest markets and a major growth driver. But when it comes to the newest iPhones, the country will have to wait, highlighting the difficulties the technology giant faces in getting its China strategy right.
The Cupertino, Calif., company on Tuesday unveiled its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which have larger screens than previous models. But while Apple said its new smartphones would go on sale Sept. 19 in the U.S. and some European and Asian markets, including Hong Kong, it didn't list China as one of countries where they would be immediately available.
That is a change from Apple's launch of the iPhone 5S last year, when the device was available through major carriers in China at the same time as the U.S.
Apple's Beijing-based spokeswoman declined to comment on the reason for the delay. She said the company sees China as a key market and is trying to get the new iPhones there as soon as possible.
China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which approves the import of mobile devices among many other things, didn't list the new smartphones among devices approved for sale as of Wednesday. Officials didn't respond to a request for comment.
A moderate delay wouldn't likely do lasting damage to Apple's sales in China because of the brand's cachet and because the bigger screens are attractive to Chinese consumers, analysts say. Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, generated $5.94 billion in revenue for Apple during the fiscal third quarter ended June 28, up 28% from a year earlier and making up nearly 16% of its total revenue. That compares with $14.58 billion in the U.S. and $8.09 billion in Europe.
"Apple may face limited supplies initially and could want time to build up the phone's new electronic wallet function there," said Sandy Shen, an analyst at Gartner.
Other analysts speculated that the delay could be due to a recent cut in handset subsidies from Chinese mobile carriers, potentially weakening demand.
Apple has faced increasing competition from Samsung Electronics Co., which was faster to offer the larger screens that many Chinese consumers like for streaming TV shows and playing games. It is also facing growing competition from local manufacturers such as Xiaomi Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd., which are offering phones with increasingly competitive hardware at budget prices.
Apple also is under growing scrutiny tied to labor conditions among its suppliers, and faced criticism in government-run media for its warranty practices and for its location-tracking feature, with the official China Central Television labeling it a security threat. Apple has said it closely monitors labor conditions among suppliers and apologized for its warranty practices. It also says it doesn't track iPhone users.
Still, the U.S. company has increased its market share in the world's largest smartphone market after broadening sales channels. In December, it unveiled a deal to offer phones through China Mobile Ltd., the world's largest mobile carrier. Its share of the Chinese smartphone market rose to 6.5% in the second quarter from 4.9% the year before, according to IDC, making it the country's No. 6 smartphone maker.
"The country's impact on the global smartphone market has continued to increase given its large population, and its shipment growth is still relatively fast compared to the mature markets in the West," said Kitty Fok, a Beijing-based analyst at IDC.
Apple has been criticized in the past by customers for being slow to launch products in China, a phenomenon that has led to a flourishing gray market in iPhones bought elsewhere, typically in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong retailers said they expected the delay would reignite gray-market demand.
"We have seen keen interest in the iPhone 6 among Chinese customers," said Lo Lau, who operates a smartphone store in Hong Kong's bustling Mongkok neighborhood. Mr. Lau said he expects sales of gray-market iPhones to jump between 20% and 30% as a result of the delayed mainland launch.
Apple's new products were the most-discussed topic on Chinese social-media service Sina Weibo on Wednesday. "The iPhone 6 Plus will kill all the big-screen Android devices to become the new must-have for rich people," wrote Wang Guanxiong, a well-known tech marketing expert.
Still, for many users, the most noteworthy element of the release was the translation of "Bigger than Bigger," Apple's slogan for the new phones, on the company's mainland China website. Many said it sounded awkward in Chinese. "Can't Apple afford to hire someone with a basic education to handle the translation?" asked one Weibo user.
Some posted their own slogans in response, among them "Really Damn Big," "Just Big," and "If You Say It's Not Big, You're Not Being Objective." One user, taking a dig at Apple for following Samsung in offering bigger screens, suggested "More Samsung Than Samsung."
There are no prices listed on Apple's mainland China website yet, but the company's Hong Kong website lists the 16-gigabyte iPhone 6 at 5,588 Hong Kong dollars ($721) and the 16GB iPhone 6 Plus at HK$6,388. That's more expensive than the comparable Samsung Galaxy S5, which typically sells for less than 4,000 yuan ($652) in China, and the Mi 4, produced by China's Xiaomi, which goes for about 2,000 yuan.
"Here are three reasons I won't be buying the iPhone 6," read one popular post on Weibo, with a photo attached that repeated the Chinese character for "poor" three times.
The Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the responses.

Corporate News: Kickstarter, Angels Lead on Sense Funds

At 23, James Proud is a rising Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur who has raised nearly $13 million in funding -- none of which is from institutional investors.
His company, Hello, raised $10.5 million from a circle of well-connected angel investors, some of whom wrote million-dollar checks. And in a crowdfunding campaign that ended Friday, he raised an additional $2.4 million on Kickstarter, via nearly 20,000 backers who either donated money or preordered his flagship product: Sense, a sleep tracker slated to begin shipping to Kickstarter backers in November for $99.
The device, which eventually will retail for $129, is a small orb that sits on your night stand and measures the pollen in the air, humidity, the light in the room, any sounds and other disturbances at night. It also comes with a small disc, called the pill, that is attached to the sleeper's pillow and tracks movement.
Sense didn't break any records on the crowdfunding site. Ouya, the game console, got $8.6 million; and Pebble, a smartwatch, was the No. 1, with $10.3 million raised in 2012.
But Mr. Proud's path should give some big venture-capital firms pause, as founders like him find there are more ways to raise eight figures without traditional venture-capital firms. In 2011, at age 20, Mr. Proud, was a member of the Thiel Fellows, a group of 20 teenagers paid by billionaire investor Peter Thiel to skip college and pursue entrepreneurship or other projects.
Mr. Proud's circle of backers -- of the non-Kickstarter variety -- include some well-known names in the industry, such as David Marcus, the former head of PayPal; Dan Rose, a Facebook executive; Aaron Sittig, a former designer of Facebook; Shakil Khan, an adviser to startups like Spotify; and Hugo Barra, a Xiaomi executive. According to Mr. Proud, the investors are people, often friends, who offered strategic advantages because of their networks or experience. They're also letting the 23-year-old retain significant control.
"If someone gives you the terms you want and the control you want, you take that," Mr. Proud says.
That isn't to say he would never turn to venture capital if he ever needed the money down the road to expand, he says.
Mr. Proud, a native of South London, says the structure has helped him run his company the way he wants to. In San Francisco's Portrero Hill neighborhood, Hello's cavernous office is filled with 20 employees. Half are hardware experts from companies such as Foxconn and Garmin, and the other half are software brains. Sketches of the Sense globe and complex formulas are scrawled all over the white walls.
Founded in September 2012, Hello spent about 18 months working on a wearable device, but it decided to scrap those plans in March after it became clear from conversations with prospective customers that a sleep-centric device was compelling enough. Four months later, Sense launched on Kickstarter.
While Mr. Proud doesn't consider Kickstarter to be similar to a fundraising round, since most of the money will go to manufacturing, he says the site gave the team negotiating power with manufacturers and, more important, a hyper-engaged community to provide feedback.
Kickstarter "certainly gives people more options," Mr. Proud says.

WSJ.D Technology: China Smartphone Maker Widens Reach

SHENZHEN, China -- After overtaking Samsung Electronics Co. to become the third-largest smartphone maker in China, Coolpad, a brand little known outside of the country, is now setting its sights overseas.
For the first time, the Chinese smartphone maker is planning to spend millions of dollars this year to promote its brand in Southeast Asia, Europe and the U.S., where the company is gearing up for an expansion, Coolpad Group Ltd. Vice President Cao Jingsheng said.
The company, which began as a maker of pagers and telecommunications gear, has been seeking collaboration with new carriers and distribution partners outside China and aims to raise its revenue contribution from overseas to 30% by 2017 from less than 10% last year, Mr. Cao said in an interview. Coolpad is also interested in acquisitions abroad that can help beef up its content offerings, he said, declining to elaborate.
The company's global ambitions are part of a broader trend of Chinese smartphone vendors expanding outside their borders as growth slows at home.
China's smartphone market -- already the largest in the world -- is becoming saturated, and fierce price competition is keeping margins thin for most vendors. To seek new sources of growth and profit, China's major smartphone makers are selling more handsets abroad, especially in emerging markets. But Coolpad is far behind other big Chinese competitors in terms of international expansion: Huawei Technologies Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. are already growing rapidly in emerging markets such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
Compared with Huawei and Lenovo, Coolpad lacks clear advantages, analysts say. Huawei, the world's second-largest supplier of telecom equipment, is taking advantage of its close relationships with wireless carriers around the world. Lenovo, the world's largest personal-computer maker, is better known than any other Chinese competitor as a consumer brand.
Still, Coolpad is growing quickly. In its home market, Coolpad ranked third with a market share of 11.5% in the second quarter, behind Lenovo's 12.5% and Xiaomi Inc.'s 12.4%, according to research firm IDC.
Coolpad says it was able to grow by offering advanced hardware at lower prices and because it has strong ties with all state-controlled Chinese carriers, which have broad distribution networks across the country.
The company was also one of the first smartphone makers to offer speedier fourth-generation smartphones in China, giving it the largest second-quarter market share in China's 4G smartphone market, said IDC analyst Tay Xiaohan.
Mr. Cao said Coolpad's cost advantage helped the company win a 4G phone order from U.S. wireless carrier MetroPCS Communications Inc. in 2012. He said MetroPCS's tender requested a 4G smartphone with a 3.5-inch display at the wholesale price of $99. Coolpad made a phone called Coolpad Quattro 4G with a 4-inch display at the same price and has shipped more than 1.3 million phones.
He also said Coolpad was the first vendor to launch a 4-inch smartphone below 1,000 yuan ($163) in China, in 2010.
Strong sales of smartphones lifted Coolpad's first-half profit 94% to 412.9 million Hong Kong dollars ($53 million).
"Since our operation has grown to a certain scale, we started considering investment and acquisition opportunities overseas . . . that can help drive our future growth," Mr. Cao said.
Coolpad rarely marketed its brand in the past because it had close ties with the Chinese carriers. But with the rise of e-commerce and different phone-distribution channels, the company wants to pursue a more active marketing campaign, he said.

No Knockoff Here; Meet China's New Gadgets

BEIJING -- One dreams of making bathroom scales offering fitness advice. Another hopes to sell devices that track and analyze bat swings to players on Major League Baseball teams. A third wants to make bracelets for tracking missing children.
In laboratories and startups across China, tinkerers with big dreams are pushing what many in the industry see as a potential new wave of Chinese innovation. They see smart gadgets -- wearables and other devices that connect to the Internet or interact with users -- as an opportunity to create a Chinese-designed product for a global audience.
To get there, they are tapping China's massive electronics supply chain, which is building increasingly sophisticated products ranging from iPads to Xboxes. Proximity to that supply chain lets inventors tweak their pet projects at the factory itself, giving them greater control over the finished product.
"China will be one of the most advanced research-and-development centers for the new convergence between hardware and software, given it's the world's factory," said Annabelle Long, a director of venture capital for Bertelsmann Group.
The Bertelsmann fund has invested in a company called Zepp Labs, which makes a motion sensor that can be strapped to the end of a baseball bat. The company was formed by Robin Han, a student at Microsoft Corp.'s China engineering Ph.D. program, who was working on sensors for videogame controls but saw the potential to use them for real sports. The sensor can be attached to the end of a bat with a rubber mount. It tracks data like swing speed and arc to help coaches and players accurately tweak their technique. The sensors can also be used for tennis and golf.
The company, with offices in China and in Silicon Valley, said it has about 150,000 active users and is pushing to build a brand in the U.S. In 2013 Zepp said it raised $20 million, and it currently has teams of more than 20 employees in both China and the U.S.
In China, the company has "a team on the ground to develop and manufacture its products," said Jason Fass, Zepp's chief executive and a former Apple Inc. product manager. "Having that coverage has been enormously helpful."
China has long sought innovation as a way to develop a more sophisticated economy and to shrug off its reputation for succeeding by merely copycatting. But the new wave of gadget makers is attracting both foreign and local investors, drawn by the success of Chinese startups like its numerous mobile-app makers and smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc.
China is betting heavily on innovation as a way to help its economy develop beyond its traditional reliance on factories, exports and government spending. At a meeting of lawmakers in March, top Chinese economic planning officials called for development of a new generation of smart gadgets as part of a broader effort to emphasize cutting-edge technology. China has invested in areas to help that process, such as a pledge this year to spend 120 billion yuan (nearly $20 billion) over an unspecified period to build its nascent semiconductor industry.
Already some Chinese companies are showing greater ability to compete in relatively new areas such as smartphones. Lenovo Group Inc. and Xiaomi are making phones with competitive features and pricing and are pushing into overseas markets. Some analysts say they expect leading smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. to begin ceding global market share to Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Lenovo.
By contrast, Lenovo launched its first personal computer in 1990 but didn't become an international competitor until it bought International Business Machine Corp.'s PC business 15 years later.
Jason Krikorian, an investor at venture-capital firm DCM and co-founder of Sling Media, said that the production expertise and growing quality of manufacturing in China is driving innovation in the country.
"Location is critical," he said. "That can absolutely serve as a benefit to the market and spur local innovation." Zach Smith, a co-founder of a 3-D printer company that Stratasys Inc. purchased last year for $403 million, moved to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen in 2012 to be closer to major manufacturers like Apple assembler Foxconn Technology Co. "Shenzhen is pretty much paradise for a maker/engineer-type geek like me," he said.
Chinese companies outside the hardware world are also exploring it. Search-engine and antivirus company Qihoo 360 Technology Co. has released a smartwatch for children, designed to track children's movement to address China's persistent child-kidnapping problem. The colorful watches also allow parents to communicate with their children and track the time they spend in different locations.
But success isn't ensured. China is still grappling with rampant piracy, which can be a major challenge for a new company worried about losing its ideas.
"It's a great market, but how is the execution going to work?" said Wallen Mphepo, an entrepreneur who originally chose Beijing as the place to work on a pet project: wearable screens that allow clothes and shoes to change colors with a touch to a smartphone app. This year he shifted his R&D work to Lithuania to assuage potential venture-capital investors worried about idea theft, as well as for tax breaks.
"They understand the complexity of the Chinese market," said Mr. Mphepo, who kept much of the electronics work in Beijing.
Industry analysts say China still struggles to nurture its entrepreneurs. Capital can be hard to find in a country where the biggest banks tend to favor large state-owned companies, they say. Chinese corporate culture also isn't usually open to new ideas.
Some in China are trying to change that. Taiwan's Foxconn, which makes gadgets for Apple, Sony Corp. and many others in its Chinese factories, has set up a new platform called Kick2real to provide support for entrepreneurs looking to make wearable devices and mobile accessories. The site provides expert opinions on ideas for new hardware products before Foxconn eventually selects projects that it will help manufacture.
In Zhongguancun, the northwest part of Beijing known as the home to many of China's new startups, the local government subsidizes one laboratory for gadgets called the Beijing Makerspace. On a recent visit, the laboratory was littered with 3-D printers, laser cutters and of circuit boards. A number of tinkerers were working on everything from screens that can be attached to shoes to sensors that track the movement of crowds in bars and clubs.
Its founder, Justin Wang, said a number of local officials became particularly gung ho about helping out after they visited the MIT Media Lab in the U.S. "They see there is cross-boundary, cross-disciplinary innovation from the grass roots," he said.
"They say 'OK, let's help you,'" he said. Mr. Wang said he plans to cooperate with the local government and Foxconn to create a small factory where aspiring hardware startups can build prototype products before they are sent elsewhere in China for mass production. The new space will feature a library of chips, sensors and material for their use.
Ken Xu, a partner at Chinese venture-capital firm Gobi Partners, said his firm began investing in hardware startups in China in 2012. In addition to investing in the Beijing laboratory, it has also bet on one company that creates small devices to monitor air quality in Chinese homes and a second that has made a smart scale that gives diet and exercise recommendations.
"People care a lot about their weight," he said. "They may not do a lot to change it, but they want to know it."
Domestically, a few companies have generated big buzz. One startup called Tomoon Technology announced plans to make a smartwatch last year after Samsung announced plans for its Galaxy Gear line of smartwatches. It featured an aluminum band and a screen that uses an e-ink screen to increase battery life
An ad for Tomoon went viral on Chinese social media. In 24 hours it got more than 28,000 preorders for the watch, which it sold for 499 yuan ($81), a discount from the Samsung watch's 2,499-yuan price tag in China.
The rush proved a challenge, as the company then had only about 30 employees, said Wang Wei, a Tomoon founder. Many of the orders melted away -- out of a total of 70,000 preorders, only about one-tenth paid. Of that group, about 1,000 are still waiting for their watch.
Tomoon is undaunted. Mr. Wang said that the company is already at work on a second smartwatch, with an expected release date of September. The watch will monitor the wearer's health.
"I am sure that we can surpass the big international companies in innovation," he said.

Corporate News: Japan's SoftBank Girds for U.S. Fight

TOKYO -- SoftBank Corp. gave a glimpse of its plans to tackle the U.S. cellphone market, unveiling a deal to develop low-cost smartphones for its Sprint Corp. unit and a new service that would allow unlimited downloads from select applications.
SoftBank said Monday that together with fellow Japanese company Sharp Corp. it has developed a smartphone with near-frameless displays that it plans to sell through Sprint. It also introduced App Pass, a service that it plans to launch later this month, which will have a lineup of 100 applications as diverse as games, recipes and free access to news.
SoftBank and U.S.-based Sprint will offer the handset, the Aquos Crystal, exclusively. App Pass will be preinstalled on the handsets, the Japanese telecommunications company said.
While SoftBank didn't disclose pricing for the U.S. market, its pricing in Japan offers a look at the kind of services it is trying to bring to the U.S. to set Sprint apart from Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc.
In Japan, for example, SoftBank said the handset will be offered free of charge to new users switching from other carriers. For $3.61 a month, users would have access to apps that would cost $390 to download separately. As part of the plan, users also would receive $4.88 of credit to use for in-app purchases. Sprint is expected to announce a similar plan in the U.S. on Tuesday.
After shelving plans to buy smaller carrier T-Mobile US Inc. earlier this month, Sprint is studying price plans to stop subscriber losses. Sprint, which has previously focused on a network overhaul, is ready to pare costs and engage its rivals in fierce price competition under its new chief executive, Marcelo Claure. The company has been unprofitable since 2007, and winning customers will be a challenge. Many prospective users have their connections locked up in contracts, while rivals already offer low-cost plans. Cable rollouts of Wi-Fi networks also might threaten cellular-network demand.
"We can use our scale to gain price competitiveness and win exclusive agreements," said Maki Tahara, who heads SoftBank's marketing strategy.
SoftBank also said Monday it plans to sell 400 billion yen ($3.91 billion) of bonds to individual investors, which some analysts took as a sign the company is looking for further expansion. At the time SoftBank abandoned its bid for T-Mobile, the company was looking at more than a dozen other acquisition targets, people close to SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son have said.
The handset deal provides a boost for Sharp, which had all but abandoned global phone sales and has been vying with Sony Corp. for a distant No. 2 spot in the Japanese smartphone market, after Apple Inc. Sharp sold only 5.5 million handsets in the fiscal year ended in March, after four straight years of declines. The SoftBank deal will help it achieve a sales goal of 6.3 million units this year, it said.
The deal comes as Sony, which has been trying to get a better foothold in the U.S. smartphone market, had been wooing Sprint as well.
Sony has approached Sprint about selling Sony's Xperia smartphone in the U.S., according to people familiar with the talks. Sony, which had pegged hopes for a turnaround on its mobile operations, had also approached Verizon and AT&T, touting the new phone's advanced camera and audio technologies, they said.
The status of those talks wasn't clear Monday, but Sony last month cut its sales forecast for smartphones, and said its mobile unit might need to lower its forecast to an annual loss.
"We had received a number of offers from different vendors," said SoftBank's Yoshiaki Adachi, a manager in charge of product design. "That we would be able to make this offering exclusive was a large draw."
Future tie-ups with other phone makers are a possibility, he said, declining to elaborate.
Sony declined to comment on any talks with Sprint, adding that the company doesn't comment on speculation.
Japan's phone makers, pioneers in mobile Internet technology, are fighting for relevance. Abroad, they are hemmed in by Apple Inc.'s iPhones at the high end of the market while Chinese brands such as Huawei Technologies Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Xiaomi Inc. are gaining market share at the low end. At home, the iPhone is increasing its market dominance with a 67.4% share after NTT DoCoMo Inc.'s decision last fall to begin supplying the smartphone.
"We need the U.S. market to truly establish ourselves in the telecom sector. Japan is not enough," Sharp President Kozo Takahashi said.

WSJ.D Technology: China Phone Companies Make Push in India

NEW DELHI -- Indian cellphone makers that made their names undercutting the prices of big global brands such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. are now being challenged at their own game as Chinese brands land in India.
Micromax Informatics Ltd. and Karbonn Mobiles came from relative obscurity in India to dominate the world's second-biggest telecommunications market, after China, by the number of handsets sold. But they are stuck in a pricing and features war for Indian buyers of low-cost phones, as Chinese cellphone startups such as Xiaomi Inc., Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp. and Gionee Communication Equipment Co. set their sights on Indian consumers who value a product's cost rather than its brand name.
"To counter the competition of Chinese brands, both local handset vendors and foreign brands need to [offer] the existing set of device features at even lower price points," said Tarun Pathak, a telecom analyst at Cyber Media Research.
Cyber Media, based in New Delhi, estimates that Chinese brands have less than a 5% market share right now, but the surge in the market share of previously unknown Indian brands shows how quickly market dominance can change when the South Asian consumer is offered a product at the right price.
In 2008, the top Indian brands had a market share of a little more than 1%, according to data from research firm IDC. That share has now surged to more than 40%.
Micromax -- which didn't exist six years ago -- dethroned Samsung as the best-selling cellphone brand in India in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research, a research-and-consulting company based in Hong Kong. With backing from venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital, Micromax has captured the Indian market by offering phones at 30% lower prices than the big global brands and building its name through a nationwide advertising campaign.
Gionee -- one of China's larger cellphone makers -- wants to pull off the same kind of surge in market share in India. It currently has about a 3% market share, up from 1% last year. "We have been able to take away market share from both multinational companies as well as domestic brands" by offering a range of phones at competitive prices, said Arvind Vohra, India head for Gionee smartphones.
Cellphone companies are pursuing Indian consumers such as engineering student Shehzaad, who lives in Meerut, a town near Delhi. He says he has always avoided the big global brands to save a few rupees and recently gave up his Micromax phone for a Gionee phone.
"It has more features than Micromax, qualitywise it is better and is much cheaper," said the 20-year-old, who goes by only one name.
The weak spot for the Chinese newcomers is their distribution network in India, where most of the more than 1.2 billion population lives outside of the big cities. One of India's leading low-cost brands, Karbonn Mobiles, for example, already reaches more than 85,000 retail outlets.
The Indian companies know that the shortcut to capturing market share in India is to sell their products at a few dollars less than the competition. Still, if necessary, it might be difficult for the Indian brands to undercut the Chinese manufacturers on price.
"Indian handset vendors definitely need to keep a check on the price," said Karan Thakkar, a telecom analyst at IDC.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS
Investor Signals Wish
For Further Shake-Up
Barington Companies Equity Partners LP said it is withdrawing its proposal that the board of Darden Restaurants Inc. select an independent director as chairman, after the company did so last week, but signaled support for a further shake-up.
Darden said last week that its chairman and chief executive, Clarence Otis, would step down.
The Orlando, Fla.-based owner of the Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains has been under fire since late last year from activist investors, who have argued it would be better off broken into three pieces. Rather than divide itself, Darden earlier this year sold its Red Lobster chain, infuriating shareholder activists including Starboard Value LP, which said it would seek to replace the board.
The company said Charles A. Ledsinger Jr., the board's current lead-independent director, would assume the role of chairman, effective immediately.
On Tuesday, Barington said it appreciates Darden's selection of an independent director, but that the move will have "little impact" if most of Darden's directors are re-elected. The firm signaled its support for Starboard's proposal for an overhaul of a majority of the board.

SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS
Dominance In Cellphones
Starts to Show Cracks
Signs are emerging that Samsung Electronics Co. is losing its dominance in two of Asia's fastest-growing cellphone markets: China and India. That is because smartphone consumers across the region are flocking to Samsung's local rivals.
Counterpoint Technology Market Research, a data tracker based in Hong Kong, said Tuesday that Samsung's No. 1 position in India mobile-phone sales was surpassed in the second quarter by Micromax Informatics Ltd.
Canalys, another market-research firm, released similar figures Tuesday, showing Micromax accounted for 17.5% of mobile-phone sales in India during the second quarter, ahead of Samsung's 15.1%.
Earlier this week, Canalys said Beijing-based Xiaomi Inc., which has been selling smartphones for only three years, leapfrogged past Samsung. Xiaomi captured a 14% market share in China for the second quarter. Samsung and Lenovo Group Ltd. each had a 12% stake. It is quite a switch from the first quarter, when Xiaomi's 10.7% market share trailed Samsung's 18.3%.
Taken together, the data point to a worrisome trend for Samsung, which last week reported a 20% decline in second-quarter net profit, its first year-over-year profit pullback in almost three years. Samsung declined to comment on the latest data.

SEOUL -- Signs are emerging that Samsung Electronics Co. is losing its dominance in two of Asia's fastest-growing cellphone markets: China and India.
That is because smartphone consumers across the region are flocking to Samsung's local rivals.
Counterpoint Technology Market Research, a data tracker based in Hong Kong, said Tuesday that Samsung's No. 1 position in India mobile-phone sales was surpassed in the second quarter by Micromax Informatics Ltd., a local rival founded just five years ago.
Canalys, another market-research firm, released similar figures Tuesday, showing Micromax accounted for 17.5% of mobile-phone sales in India during the second quarter, ahead of Samsung's 15.1%. In smartphones alone, Samsung still retained the lead after stripping out low-end feature phones.
Earlier this week, Canalys said Beijing-based Xiaomi Inc., which has been selling smartphones for only three years, leapfrogged past Samsung to the top position in China, the world's largest cellphone market. Xiaomi captured a 14% market share in China for the second quarter. Samsung and Lenovo Group Ltd. each had a 12% stake. It is quite a switch from the first quarter, when Xiaomi's 10.7% market share trailed Samsung's 18.3%.
Taken together, the data points to a worrisome trend for Samsung, which last week reported a 20% decline in second-quarter net profit, its first year-over-year profit pullback in almost three years. Samsung declined to comment on the latest data.
While it is still the top smartphone maker in Southeast Asia thanks to its aggressive marketing and branding efforts, Samsung has lost market share in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, which have a combined population of about 360 million people, over the past year, according to Counterpoint.
In the Philippines and Thailand, Samsung clings to a slight edge over a bevy of local rivals and global competitors such as Apple Inc., whose share has grown in the past year, Counterpoint said.
"In general in India and China, Samsung is under a lot of pressure in the low end," said Jessica Kwee, a Singapore-based analyst for Canalys, citing increased pressure from local vendors who are trying to compete by delivering more bang for the buck.
More competition from these rivals is likely to continue pinching Samsung's profitability, analysts say. Operating-profit margins for Samsung's mobile division fell to 15.5% in the second quarter from 17.7% a year earlier, the company said. That is the slimmest margin recorded by the division since late 2011.
While increased competition is partly to blame, Samsung also has hurt itself. In China in particular, company executives have blamed poor inventory management that left a glut of third-generation smartphones on its shelves -- just as Chinese consumers brace for the arrival of faster smartphones on fourth-generation networks.
Counterpoint's monthly data shows Samsung's China market share peaked in February and then steadily declined to about 17% in June. Lenovo and Huawei Technologies Co. weren't far behind, according to Tom Kang, a director at the research firm, with about 14% each.

Corporate News: Sony Repairs TV Unit, Not Phones --- Electronics Giant Posts Small Quarterly Profit but Cuts Annual Forecast for Handset Sales

TOKYO -- Sony Corp. sharply cut its forecast for sales of smartphones, one of the pillars on which the Japanese technology giant had hoped to rebuild its troubled electronics business.
The move was a blot on otherwise encouraging results for the first quarter ended June 30: Sony on Thursday posted net income of 26.8 billion yen ($261 million), thanks to upbeat sales of videogames and movies, defying analyst expectations of a loss. Sales rose 5.8% from a year earlier to 1.8 trillion yen, while operating profit nearly doubled to 69.8 billion yen.
Sony's TV business stayed profitable, and the company said it remained on track to break a 10-year streak of annual losses there, although the company did trim its TV sales forecast.
But Sony's mobile-phone unit, which a year ago had been the company's most profitable electronics division, posted an operating loss amid sagging sales. The company cut its annual sales target to 43 million handsets from the 50 million it had predicted in May. Instead of making a profit, the mobile division will merely break even this year, Sony said. In the fiscal year that ended in March, Sony sold 39 million phones and the division posted a profit of 12.6 billion yen.
"Our estimate in May was optimistic," said Sony's chief financial officer, Kenichiro Yoshida, at a news conference.
Sony stuck with its forecast for a companywide loss of 50 billion yen for the year. It would be its sixth loss in seven years.
The dialing back of Sony's smartphone ambitions represents a setback to CEO Kazuo Hirai's efforts to revive the company's reputation for innovation.
Sony executives have said the company needs to expand its smartphone business, because many of the areas in which it competes -- from cameras to videogames and movies -- come together in mobile devices.
Mr. Yoshida said the mobile unit is reviewing its midterm business plan, and might have to lower its forecast again, to an annual loss.
To keep the business profitable, Sony plans to cut costs by streamlining its smartphone lineup and slowing the pace of products, Mr. Yoshida said. He added that Sony isn't considering an exit from smartphones, but it will be more selective in terms of the countries it targets and its models.
To some extent, Sony is suffering from a problem similar to that confronting Samsung Electronics Co., which on Thursday reported a steep drop in operating profit because of slowing smartphone sales. Though Samsung sold about eight times as many smartphones as Sony during the April-June quarter, both companies are facing pressure from Apple Inc.'s iPhones at the high end and from upstart Chinese brands at the low end.
Three Chinese smartphone makers that rank between No. 3 and No. 5 globally in terms of market share -- Huawei Technologies Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Xiaomi Inc. -- all made sizable gains in the latest quarter, according to data from Counterpoint, a technology research firm. While Huawei's smartphone shipments nearly doubled, to 20.6 million, Sony's fell to 9.4 million from 9.6 million, giving it a market share of about 3.1%.
A problem for Sony is a lack of promotion via U.S. cellular carriers, an important route for sales. Among the four major U.S. networks, only T-Mobile US Inc. sells Sony's Xperia phones directly. Sony has approached the others -- Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc. and Sprint Corp. -- about possible joint sales efforts, people familiar with the matter said.
Sony trimmed its sales forecast for its troubled TV business, saying it would sell 15.5 million sets in the full year, down from 16 million expected in May. But the company said it could still achieve its goal of making the business profitable this year, by getting it to operate more efficiently. Sony made its TV arm into a separate unit in July. The segment that includes TVs posted a 7.7 billion yen profit in the latest quarter, compared with a 3.4 billion yen profit a year earlier.
Mr. Yoshida said Sony needed more structural reform, because its electronics business was still generating a loss during the April-June quarter.

Overall, analysts applauded Mr. Yoshida's continued push to cut costs.
"In our view, the electronics business is Sony's Achilles' heel,'' wrote Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies & Co., in a note to investors. "We maintain that it needs to shrink its ambitions in this ultracompetitive space, and we are pleased to see CFO Yoshida-San is doing/enforcing exactly that."
Sony's videogame business performed well during the period, with strong sales of the PlayStation 4 console and additional fees from users playing online. The segment posted a profit of ?4.3 billion, compared with a loss of ?16.4 billion last year.
The movie business marked a ?7.8 billion profit, up from ?3.7 billion last year. "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" performed well, though not quite as well as hoped, Sony said.

WSJ.D Technology: Alibaba Eyes Snapchat Stake

Snapchat Inc. has held preliminary talks with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. to raise a new round of financing that could value the mobile-messaging startup at about $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
The discussions may not lead to a deal, the people said. It is unclear whether the talks are ongoing.
An 11-figure valuation for a company with close to zero revenue and an app that didn't exist four years ago would mark a new high watermark in this era of investor optimism, as financiers compete to buy shares of the hottest technology companies and drive up valuations.
The discussions also highlight the growing allure of U.S. tech startups to China's largest e-commerce giant. As Alibaba prepares to hold an initial public offering later this year, it has made a series of investments in fast-growing Silicon Valley startups -- such as video-call app maker TangoMe Inc. -- with an eye toward expanding into the U.S. market.
While Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall shopping sites dominate China's e-commerce market, Alibaba also is competing with homegrown rival, Tencent Holdings Ltd., for the attention of China's more than 500 million smartphone users. Tencent's WeChat messaging service has about 400 million active users, with a bulk of them in China, and the company is trying to integrate other services like mobile games and e-commerce into the chat app.
Alibaba has been trying to promote its own messaging map called Laiwang, but the app has far fewer users than WeChat. So it has struck a number of deals with other Chinese companies since last year to bolster its services for mobile users. Among those deals, Alibaba bought a stake and later reinvested in Sina Corp.'s Twitter-like Weibo microblog business.
The latest investment talks could put Alibaba and Tencent in a tug of war over Snapchat. Tencent is already an investor in Snapchat after participating in an earlier round of fundraising. Alibaba's investment could prevent Tencent from deepening its ties with Snapchat. Tencent couldn't be reached for comment.
Bloomberg News earlier reported the possible investment from Alibaba.
Snapchat makes no money from its mobile app, which sends visual messages that vanish after a few seconds. But the increasing popularity of the service with young smartphone users has sparked interest in the business, evidenced by Facebook Inc.'s acquisition offer for Snapchat of around $3 billion and an investment led by Coatue Management LLC valuing the startup at more than $2 billion, both last year.
A $10 billion valuation may not be far-fetched in the fast-moving technology landscape. Facebook paid $19 billion earlier this year for messaging app WhatsApp, and four other private companies have been tagged by venture capitalists with a valuation of $10 billion valuation of more.
However, those companies -- which includes taxi-hailing app Uber Technologies Inc., online storage company Dropbox Inc., home-rental site Airbnb Inc. and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. -- are all said to have revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Evan Spiegel, Snapchat's 24-year-old co-founder and chief executive, could use additional capital to fuel a hiring spree and speed product development. The startup has raised close to $130 million from investors, which beside Tencent include venture firms Benchmark, SV Angel, Lightspeed Venture Partners and General Catalyst.
Snapchat doesn't disclose its number of users, but researcher comScore estimates 27 million people used the app on iPhones and Android phones in June, up from 11 million a year ago. Mr. Spiegel has said users send more than 400 million "snaps," or vanishing messages, per day and that the service is most popular with young women.

Countering Samsung, Apple Prepares Big-Screen Phones

Apple Inc. is preparing for its largest initial production run of iPhones, betting that larger-screen models will lure consumers now attracted to similar phones from Samsung Electronics Co. and others.
The Cupertino, Calif., company is asking suppliers to manufacture between 70 million and 80 million units combined of two large-screen iPhones with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays by Dec. 30, according to people familiar with the matter.
Its forecast for what is commonly called the iPhone 6 is significantly larger than the initial order last year of between 50 million and 60 million versions of the iPhone 5S and 5C -- which had a display measuring 4-inches diagonally, these people said. Both of the coming models are expected to feature metal cases similar to the iPhone 5S and likely come in multiple colors, these people said.
Apple stuck with smaller displays on iPhones even as rival smartphone makers rolled out bigger screens and customers clamored for larger phones. Demand for larger-screen smartphones boosted Samsung, which started offering a 4.8-inch display in its Samsung Galaxy S models in 2012 and introduced an array of bigger phones.
Apple was scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results on Tuesday and provide a financial outlook for the current period ending Sept. 28. Historically, Apple has released a new iPhone in mid-September.
Analysts were forecasting Apple will report sales of about 35.9 million iPhone units for the three months ended June 30. That would be up about 15% from a year earlier.
For Apple, one possible hiccup with the larger screen is that display makers for the new iPhones are struggling to improve the production of the larger 5.5-inch screens, people familiar with the matter said. The production is complicated because the displays are using in-cell technology, which allows the screens to be thinner and lighter by integrating touch sensors into the liquid crystal display and making it unnecessary to have a separate touch-screen layer.
To factor in the possibility of a higher failure rate for displays, Apple has asked component makers to prepare for up to 120 million iPhones by year-end, the people familiar with the matter said. It made a similar request last year to prepare enough parts for a combined 90 million iPhones to provide some slack in its supply chain.
The 5.5-inch iPhone screen would face an additional manufacturing complication if it uses a cover using sapphire crystal, a more durable but costly alternative to glass, people familiar with the matter said.
Apple's iPhone production forecast assumes a surge in demand from Apple's partnership with China Mobile Ltd., the world's largest carrier, which started offering the iPhone earlier this year. Bigger-screen smartphones are also popular in China and other emerging markets where the smartphone is replacing the personal computer as a main computing device.
As Apple competes against Google Inc.'s Android operating system, larger screens are now common in Apple's core mobile market -- high-price phones. In May, 98% of Android smartphones that sold globally at the equivalent of $400 or above featured a display greater than 5 inches, according to Counterpoint Research.
The new iPhones are coming to market as Samsung's smartphone business is showing signs of sluggishness. Earlier this month, Samsung warned that its earnings would fall for a third straight quarter due to a glut of unsold smartphones. It is feeling the pinch in emerging markets where its low- to mid-end smartphones are facing intense price competition from rival Asian handset makers including Lenovo Group Ltd. and Xiaomi Inc.
Every year, Apple faces a delicate balancing act. It is critical for Apple to ensure that it has enough supplies of a new iPhone during the holiday season when demand is greatest. Shortages can often result in sales for its rivals, although too much inventory also is a concern.
Apple disappointed investors in last year's December quarter when iPhone sales rose 7% from a year earlier, falling short of Wall Street expectations of a 15% increase as it struggled to fulfill demand for the 5S and failed to move enough 5C units. The slump proved temporary, with Apple reporting a 17% increase in the following quarter.
Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said there is "strong pent-up demand" for the iPhone 6 because customers have held off on upgrading from older iPhone models.
To fulfill Apple's demands, the company's two main iPhone assemblers -- Pegatron Corp. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn -- are on a hiring binge at their respective manufacturing sites in China. Foxconn, for example, is hiring workers by the hundreds a day to staff production lines at their respective manufacturing sites in China, said people familiar with those companies.
Foxconn and Pegatron plan to start mass producing the 4.7-inch iPhone model next month and Hon Hai will begin making the 5.5-inch version exclusively in September, the people said.
Often, Apple's production forecasts are adjusted based on early demand, according to people familiar with the matter. For example, Apple tweaked its initial forecasts for the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C last year when the more expensive 5S initially sold better than expected and the 5C slumped in the first few months, these people said.
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has also warned that the supply chain is "very complex" and that it is impossible to take a data point from a supplier and extrapolate a broader meaning for Apple's business.
Suppliers also say that Apple likes to build up inventory heading into the new year, because it is difficult to keep production lines humming at full capacity since many workers go home during Lunar New Year, which is in February next year.

Corporate News: Xiaomi Hits Delays In Indonesia, Brazil

NEW DELHI -- Xiaomi Inc., the Chinese company that aims to take on Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in the global smartphone market, has hit a snag in its expansion plans to launch its flagship smartphone in Indonesia and Brazil.
Hugo Barra, Xiaomi's vice president for global operations, said in an interview in New Delhi that the delay is due to a "long and painful device-certification process."
Handset makers need to get their products certified by government agencies across the world before they can launch and sell in different markets. In Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico, the process can take as long as six months to meet local standards and get products certified for sale, he said.
Mr. Barra, however, said Xiaomi is hopeful about introducing its smartphone in Indonesia by the end of August. Xiaomi's plans to offer its smartphones in Brazil could take longer, he said, citing local laws that require companies like Xiaomi to assemble their products in the South American country.
"It may take a long time, probably within the next 12 months, but hard to say," Mr. Barra said.
Xiaomi -- which means "little rice" in Chinese -- has intensified competition in a smartphone market dominated by Apple and Samsung. Xiaomi has created buzz in China for selling high-end phones for prices that are close to cost. The company offers services like mobile applications and movies via its software and earns money by selling an array of accessories. As of the end of last year, it held a 6% market share in China, compared with nothing three years ago, making it No. 6 there, according to research firm IDC. Apple's iPhones held a 7% share. It sells its phones mostly in small batches online but hopes to grow, with plans to sell 60 million smartphones this year, said President Lin Bin.
In February, Mr. Lin said the company planned to sell about 40 million phones this year.
Xiaomi has in recent months made its products available in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. On Tuesday, it launched its latest phone in India and Mr. Barra said the company is also setting its sights on Brazil despite hurdles.
"Without a doubt, India and probably Brazil will become our biggest markets to focus on after China," Mr. Barra said.
As part of its expansion in India, Xiaomi is also working on licensing content. "India will be the first market where we put in a significant effort to launch our services with a local flavor," after China, he said.
The company is also working on a project to make its Mi user-interface software accessible to local Indian languages, according to Manu Jain, Xiaomi's India head.
Mr. Barra said his company aims to hire at least five engineers in India and work with startups to create features, applications and services that can be offered on its handsets.
For the current year, Xiaomi is targeting revenue of at least 70 billion yuan ($11.28 billion).

Samsung's Profit Slide Continues

SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co.'s warning of a third-straight decline in quarterly profit highlights the pitfalls of the South Korean technology giant's reliance on smartphone sales.
Strong smartphone sales have propelled the company's growth over the last two and a half years, benefitting its other businesses, including components. But Samsung estimated Tuesday that its operating earnings in the latest quarter fell by between 22.3% and 26.5% from a year earlier, hit by a glut of unsold smartphones, which also hurt the performance of the businesses that make microprocessors and displays used in its mobile devices.
In the first quarter of the year, Samsung's mobile unit accounted for about 76% of company profit, compared with just 25% for the same quarter four years earlier when Samsung derived the bulk of its earnings from the sale of semiconductors.
Though Samsung forecast better results in the traditionally strong third quarter, the company, the world's biggest maker of TVs, mobile phones and memory chips, won't likely snap its string of quarterly declines anytime soon, analysts say. That is because smartphone penetration in developed markets is nearing saturation. Meanwhile, in emerging markets, Samsung is facing stiff price competition from Asian handset makers including Xiaomi Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd.
Samsung said in an unusual explanatory note accompanying its profit forecast that in the second quarter, the company had to boost marketing to unload older and lower-end smartphones. In China, where consumers are waiting for the rollout of next-generation 4G LTE networks, Samsung suffered from a pileup of older 3G phones.
In addition, the company said that its sales of tablets were hit by the success of its own smartphone-tablet hybrids, dubbed phablets.
The company's admitted trouble in managing its inventory highlights the flip side of the company's vaunted reach into more than 100 markets: It is difficult to accurately gauge consumer demand in a fast-moving industry like the smartphone business.
Another challenge are fluctuations in the foreign-exchange market, which have pushed the South Korean won to six-year highs. In the past year, the won has gained 13% against the U.S. dollar, a trend that traders expect to continue in the longer term -- bad news to a Korean company that relies on exports for a major part of its revenue.
Even though there are high expectations for Samsung product launches in the second half, including for its flagship large-screen Galaxy Note device, the company's main rival in the high-end market, Apple Inc., is expected to launch bigger screen iPhones, according to people familiar with the matter.
"Samsung's earnings may bottom out in the second quarter, but the expected launch of iPhone 6 models will be a huge challenge for the company's high-end models in the second half," said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst with IBK Securities in Seoul.
Nomura analyst C.W. Chung said that given the increased pressure from rivals, and the difficulty of differentiating its products, Samsung would likely see the operating-profit margin at its mobile unit, which was 19.8% in the first quarter, whittled down over the next few years.
"In terms of the big picture, investors have already decided" that Samsung will struggle to differentiate itself, Mr. Chung said. "The big trend will be a downward trend."
This week, brokerage I'M Investment & Securities Co. cut its recommendation on Samsung to "hold," arguing the company will likely continue losing market share to Chinese brands.
Samsung said its second-quarter operating profit likely fell to between seven trillion won ($6.9 billion) and 7.4 trillion won from 9.53 trillion won a year earlier. Tuesday's disappointing forecast followed a 3.3% decline in operating profit in the first quarter compared with a year ago.
Investors had been bracing for Tuesday's weak numbers. In the past month, they had sent Samsung shares down by about 11%, wiping about $25 billion off its market value, as management gave off worrying signs about earnings. The stock closed Tuesday's session up 0.2% after closing at a three-month low on Monday.
The company estimated its sales fell between 7.8% and 11.2% from a year ago to a range of 51 trillion won to 53 trillion won. Samsung didn't disclose net profit estimates.
Memory chips widely used in PCs and other consumer electronics are likely to show continued improvement when the company releases its full earnings at the end of the month, analysts say. But even so, they noted that has less to do with Samsung's fundamental strengths and more with tight supply conditions that have provided a cyclical lift in prices.

WSJ.D Technology: Samsung Makes Big Push in Tablets

Can Samsung Electronics Co. take the No. 1 spot in tablet computers away from Apple Inc. and conquer that market as it has dominated smartphones?
The Korean electronics giant is giving it a shot, with a strategy that piggybacks on the success of its high-end Galaxy S handsets.
Samsung on Thursday rolled out a pair of high-end, Android-based tablets that have a more sophisticated look and feel, with a brighter, thinner and lighter screen than previous models. It is branding the tablets as an extension of that premium Galaxy S line, by adding an "S" to the end of the Galaxy Tab name as well.
"What I really tried to achieve was to give it a premium feel," said Lee Soo-jung, a senior designer with the team overseeing the Galaxy Tab S, who says she worked to put shades of gold in the white-colored tablet.
The company is also pouring more marketing dollars into the push, throwing for the first time a launch event for the tablets at a theater in New York's Madison Square Garden, a 46-year-old arena in midtown Manhattan that is more commonly the site of concerts and home to local professional basketball and ice hockey teams. Last year, Samsung launched its flagship Galaxy S4 smartphone at Radio City Music Hall.
Samsung declined to disclose how much it is spending on the launch; the company spent billions of dollars to promote its high-end flagship mobile devices globally in the past year.
Mobile-industry experts warn it will take more than glitzy promotions and glittery devices for Samsung to replicate its success in smartphones, which are currently the company's top profit generator.
Samsung's global tablet market share is already growing at the expense of Apple's, climbing to 22.3% in the first quarter from 17.5% a year earlier, while Apple's share shrank to 32.5% from 40.2%, according to research firm IDC. But the growth of the tablet market overall is slowing significantly as penetration increases in developed markets like the U.S. IDC expects global tablet shipments to rise only 12% this year to 245.4 million units, versus a 52% increase the year before.
Tablet sales are also showing signs of being undercut by oversize smartphones known as phablets, a category that Samsung is pursuing assiduously as well.
Analysts say one challenge for Samsung will be competing with myriad Android-based tablets that have equally good hardware but are cheaper. The 10.1-inch version of Samsung's Galaxy Tab S will cost $499, while the 8.4-inch version will cost $399. Last month, Chinese startup Xiaomi launched a 7.9-inch tablet called the MiPad that packs 16-gigabytes of memory for about $240. Taiwanese computer maker Asustek Computer Inc. unveiled a phone-tablet combo last month in the U.S. for $199 with a two-year AT&T Inc. contract.
With the Galaxy Tab S, Samsung is trying to make design the differentiator. Last month, Samsung named a new head of mobile design, Lee Min-hyouk, who is almost 15 years younger than his predecessor and credited with the design of some Galaxy smartphones.
Samsung designers sweated the Galaxy Tab S details, discussing everything from whether the back should have tiny circular punctures like the Galaxy S5 to the ideal tilt for flipping through Web pages sitting down, say people familiar with the matter.
But critics say Samsung muddies its premium image with its exhaustive lineup of mobile devices that come in various sizes and colors as its tries to address different price ranges.
In an interview, Samsung co-Chief Executive J.K. Shin defended Samsung's "all-segments" for "all-markets" strategy, saying "it's in our DNA to make everything from premium products to cheap ones." He stressed that the vast number of products Samsung manufactures is having an increasing influence on the daily life of consumers in various markets.
Bringing a better software experience to tablets also remains a challenge for Samsung.
The company has packed its new tablets with features like call forwarding, which allows users to take calls from their tablets after syncing them with their smartphones, and a magazine service dubbed Papergarden, with which users can view high-resolution photos from popular fashion magazines.
Samsung executives say the Tab S line will be the company's flagship tablet model. The tablets will use Samsung's organic light emitting diode or OLED display and have an 8-megapixel rear camera.
Samsung will continue to use Android for its future tablets, Mr. Shin said, adding the company doesn't have immediate plans to bring its homegrown Tizen operating system to tablets.
Samsung said the Tab S will be available in some markets starting in July, including the U.S.

WSJ.D Technology: China's ZTE Courts BlackBerry, Motorola Engineers

Corrections & Amplifications
Cao Teng, an executive at ZTE Corp., left Motorola Mobility last year and joined ZTE this year. A Technology article about ZTE in Wednesday's Marketplace section incorrectly said the company recruited him directly from Motorola Mobility.
(WSJ June 13, 2014)
(END)
SHANGHAI -- ZTE Corp. is poaching talent from struggling Western smartphone makers such as BlackBerry Ltd. and Motorola Mobility, as the Chinese company tries to expand its handset business overseas, its mobile-devices CEO said.
Amid uncertainties surrounding the prospects for BlackBerry and Motorola Mobility -- the cellphone maker that Google Inc. is in the process of selling to China's Lenovo Group Ltd. -- over the past year, ZTE has found opportunities to cherry-pick talent from those established global competitors.
Inside ZTE's human-resources department, a special team is tasked with recruiting talent from BlackBerry. While the team has so far recruited fewer than 20 people, it plans to hire more, a person familiar with the situation said. Most of the new hires from BlackBerry, which include senior engineers, are currently based in Canada, but they may later move to the U.S. or China to play greater roles for ZTE, the person added.
"We hope the talent from BlackBerry can enhance our product security and design capability," said Adam Zeng, who became the head of ZTE's mobile-device business in January, in an interview Monday. Mr. Zeng said the company will continue to actively recruit more talent from BlackBerry and other competitors.
Apart from the new hires from BlackBerry, ZTE recently recruited Cao Teng, an executive in charge of handset marketing, from Motorola Mobility.
ZTE's hiring spree comes as major Chinese smartphone makers are trying to expand globally, while some Western competitors are moving away from handset businesses. In January, Chinese personal-computer maker Lenovo agreed to buy Motorola Mobility from Google for $2.91 billion. Before announcing the Motorola deal, Lenovo had also considered buying BlackBerry, people familiar with the situation told The Wall Street Journal last year.
BlackBerry laid off as much as 40% of its workforce last year as part of its efforts to turn around its unprofitable business. Representatives for BlackBerry and Motorola Mobility couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
"To expand in North America, we need more people with international background," a ZTE spokesman said.
ZTE's biggest business is supplying networking gear such as routers and switches to telecommunications carriers world-wide. Last year, the telecom-gear business accounted for a little over half of ZTE's overall revenue, which stood at roughly $12 billion. Its handset business, meanwhile, accounted for nearly 30% of its revenue, while software and services took up the remainder.
As potential growth in the telecom gear-market is limited, ZTE has been trying to create a new source of growth by expanding its consumer-device business.
Still, ZTE's smartphone market share in China has recently declined amid intensifying competition from both domestic and foreign brands. In the first quarter, ZTE was the eighth-largest smartphone vendor in China by shipment, as its market share fell to 5% from 8% a year earlier, according to research firm Canalys.
Samsung Electronics Co. was the market leader in the quarter with an 18% share, followed by Lenovo and Beijing-based startup Xiaomi Inc., which each held 11%. Analysts attributed the drop in ZTE's market share to weak brand recognition and unattractive product design.
Mr. Zeng said ZTE plans to double its marketing expenses this year to sell more smartphones. The company now aims to ship 80 million smartphones next year, up from the 40 million units last year, he said. This year, it expects to ship 60 million smartphones.
"In the past, we mainly relied on carriers to sell our phones. But it has to change as only direct communications with customers can help provide the best user experience," Mr. Zeng said.
ZTE has established user-experience study centers in China and the U.S., the top two smartphone markets, to survey the demand and preference of customers world-wide, said Mr. Zeng.
In China, social media and online shopping are playing key roles in smartphone brands' efforts to sell more handsets. Xiaomi, for example, has built a strong fan base by communicating with online shoppers through social networks and Internet forums. Learning from Xiaomi's success, ZTE is expanding its online sales channels and responding to users' comments and suggestions on Internet forums, Mr. Zeng said.
ZTE also plans to launch a smartphone this year that will allow users to watch videos of U.S. National Basketball Association games, Mr. Zeng said. ZTE signed an agreement in late 2013 to be the NBA's exclusive handset partner in China.

Uber Inc. is in discussions with a group of fund managers for a large investment that could value the startup at more than $12 billion, people familiar with the matter said.
The five-year-old company, whose mobile app connects people with drivers for hire, is talking this week to several firms to raise near or above $500 million in funding, these people said. Possible investors include hedge funds, mutual fund BlackRock Inc. and private-equity firms General Atlantic and Technology Crossover Ventures, the people said.
Prospective investors are expected to formally express their interest by the end of this week. The company is aiming to close a deal in the next few weeks or by the end of the second quarter, these people said. The people also cautioned that a deal wasn't assured.
Bloomberg earlier reported that Uber is seeking to raise financing of more than $10 billion.
Uber is already one of the world's most valuable venture-backed startups. But a valuation of more than $12 billion would put it in an elite club.
Three tech startups -- home-rental site Airbnb Inc., file-storage service Dropbox Inc. and Chinese handset maker Xiaomi Inc. -- were valued at $10 billion apiece by investors in the past year. The funding round could also value Uber higher than two of the largest publicly traded car-rental companies. Hertz Global Holdings Inc. has a market value of about $12.8 billion and Avis Budget Group Inc. is valued at $5.8 billion.
Unlike those companies, which manage expensive fleets of vehicles and hundreds of rental offices, Uber simply maintains a network of riders and drivers, much like OpenTable Inc. operates a reservation system for diners and restaurants.
People who have looked at Uber's funding rounds are optimistic that the company could make as much as $1.5 billion in net revenue next year.
The ascent of Uber, led by its brash co-founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, has been meteoric, if at times controversial.
Founded in 2009, Uber's mobile app is upending the taxi industry by making it easy for people to hail cabs, whether taxis, limos or cars driven by average people looking to make extra money. The app shows a map of vehicles nearby and their estimated time of arrival. Uber takes a 20% cut on each ride and collects the largest fees from its premium service of black town cars and luxury sport-utility vehicles.
The service has proved popular among consumers, though Uber has faced criticism for so-called surge pricing during in-demand times. Uber also has clashed with regulators and taxi and limousine commissions eager to shut down the service or severely restrict it. The service also is fighting local rules so that it can open in markets such as Miami and Las Vegas.
The legal wrangling, however, has yet to stymie growth. Uber is now in more than 100 cities spanning 36 countries and offers services in several top cities around the world, including New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong.
Legal challenges haven't deterred would-be investors. It has raised more than $300 million, from venture firms such as Google Ventures and Benchmark and individual investors like Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos. Uber's previous round, completed last summer, valued the company at $3.5 billion.
For investors, part of Uber's allure is its grand ambition to be more than an on-demand car service. Mr. Kalanick, 37 years old, known for defending his company on Twitter, envisions Uber as a logistics network, not just for people, but also for goods and services. Uber has run limited promotions to deliver specialty items on demand, including Mariachi bands, kittens for cuddles and ice cream.
Uber is raising funds at a precarious time for technology startups. After a spate of multibillion-dollar financings and acquisitions, the technology investment market has cooled amid a sharp pullback in the equity markets and renewed skepticism that valuations for some startups have run ahead of fundamentals. Uber, which is battling several well-funded competitors, such as Lyft Inc., isn't immune from such skepticism, but it does benefit from its lead position in the market.
Uber is part of a growing family of apps in the so-called sharing economy, where users sell excess resources or their time to other users. A large portion of Uber's workforce is made up of part-time drivers. Airbnb Inc., company with a similar model that operates a home-rental marketplace, raised $450 million in April at a $10 billion valuation from an investor group led by private-equity firm TPG, also an Uber backer.
The spread of such services has become an issue for many regulators, who are often torn between supporting new technologies and upholding policies designed to protect consumers. Mr. Kalanick, who has described regulatory hurdles as evidence of the taxi industry's "war" on Uber, has bulked up his staff, most recently adding Ashwini Chhabra, a former top official at the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission, in May.
Uber's ability to justify its lofty valuation is partly dependent on navigating these legal tests and on squashing competitors, which have forced Uber to spend large sums on marketing and discounts. Nowhere is that challenge more apparent than on its home turf in San Francisco, where Uber has paid for roaming ads on vehicles prodding drivers to "shave the 'stache," a play on its rival Lyft's mascot, a pink mustache.

WSJ.D Technology: Lenovo Calls China A Tough Market

Lenovo Group Ltd.'s chief executive warned of slower growth and hotter competition in China's smartphone market but said his company will overcome challenges through its purchase of Google Inc.'s Motorola Mobility handset business.
"Now is a very tough period" for smartphone makers in China, CEO Yang Yuanqing said in an interview. "I believe China is the most fiercely competitive smartphone market in the world."
Mr. Yang's comments came as the Chinese personal-computer maker on Wednesday reported another quarter of solid earnings growth. Profit for its fiscal fourth quarter rose 25% from a year earlier, helped by stronger sales of computers and mobile devices.
Lenovo, which last year overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. as the world's largest PC maker by volume, is betting on smartphones as its next growth engine. In January, it said it would buy the Motorola business for $2.91 billion, a week after the Chinese company said it would purchase International Business Machines Corp.'s low-end server business for $2.3 billion. The Motorola and IBM deals await U.S. regulatory approval.
Mr. Yang said Motorola has strong relationships with carriers in North and South America. Lenovo plans to sell Motorola-branded smartphones in the U.S. following the deal, rather than handsets with the Lenovo logo, he said.
The Motorola acquisition means Lenovo is betting heavily on handsets as China's smartphone market shows signs of a slowdown after years of robust growth.
Total smartphone shipments in China stood at 97.5 million units in the first quarter, down 3% from the fourth, according to research firm Canalys. Nearly 65% of China's mobile-phone subscribers already use smartphones, Canalys analyst Nicole Peng estimated.
Lenovo is the second-largest smartphone vendor in China, after Samsung Electronics Co. But it faces challenges from foreign and domestic competitors, such as Apple Inc., HTC Corp. and fast-growing Chinese startup Xiaomi Inc.
Mr. Yang said the Chinese smartphone market will become less crowded as some players fail to survive the intense competition. At that time, Lenovo's handset business in China will become a more profitable, sustainable business, he said, similar to what happened in the PC market.

Baidu Sets Up Shop In Google's Backyard

SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Chinese search company Baidu Inc. is often known as the Google of China. Now, it is setting up shop in Google's backyard.
Baidu said Friday it would invest $300 million in a new research-and-development center in Silicon Valley that would have almost 200 employees and be led by Andrew Ng, most recently the head of Stanford University's artificial-intelligence lab. Mr. Ng, who also helped Google Inc. set up its artificial-intelligence efforts, was part of the research team that built a computer that taught itself to recognize cats after looking at millions of YouTube videos.
The move highlights the growing ambition and influence of China's largest Internet companies. "There's been this old stereotype that other countries copy U.S. technology," Mr. Ng said in an interview, "[but] there's tons of stuff that Baidu has done that just isn't anywhere else in the world."
China's Internet companies have grown to be some of the largest Web companies in the world, in part because the Chinese government blocks foreign-based services such as Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. The Chinese companies' users are still mostly located in China, but they are increasingly active in Silicon Valley through investments and recruitment initiatives.
Baidu rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. both have offices near Silicon Valley that spearheaded growing efforts to acquire and invest in local startups. Alibaba has filed for an initial public offering of stock in the U.S. that might become the largest listing in history. Last year, Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi Inc. hired executive Hugo Barra away from Google's Android mobile-software arm.
Baidu's new lab will focus on the development of artificial intelligence and deep learning, a field that has recently drawn investment from the likes of Google, Facebook and Microsoft Corp.
Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, in which computer scientists attempt to simulate the human brain through computers that can see and learn for themselves. Internet companies so far have primarily used artificial intelligence to improve computer recognition of images and speech, though deep learning could be used in an array of future technologies from driverless cars to robotics.
Baidu, which already has a deep-learning center in Beijing, has used the technology to help refine how it targets ads on its site and develop its speech-recognition software. Last year, it released an application that identifies objects in smartphone photographs.
Mr. Ng, part of a small fraternity of researchers with expertise in deep learning, said the new Baidu lab would give him more resources than he had at Stanford and the ability to assemble larger teams that could focus on specific projects.
"The philosophy of the lab will be to have a small number of projects with strong leaders," said Mr. Ng. Adam Coates, another Stanford artificial-intelligence researcher, is joining him at Baidu.
Baidu doesn't compete directly with Facebook and Google for users -- because both face significant blocks in China -- but the three companies compete for talent. Facebook late last year hired New York University researcher Yann LeCun to lead its own artificial-intelligence efforts. Microsoft has said it is using deep-learning technology to improve image searches for its Bing search engine.
Both U.S. companies have recently made big moves in a field that has a limited number of accomplished researchers. Another well-known person is Geoffrey Hinton, formerly of the University of Toronto, whom Google scooped up when it bought his startup DNNresearch Inc. in early 2013 for an undisclosed amount.
Earlier this year, Google bought DeepMind Technologies for more than $500 million, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. DeepMind was a London-based startup that, among other advances, built a computer that learned to master basic Atari videogames such as "Pong."

Nvidia Shifts Mobile Plans --- Graphics-Chip Maker Focuses on Phones, Tablets Aimed at Playing Videogames

Nvidia has been jostling with other chip makers to supply key components for smartphones and tablets. That is a tough market, and the Silicon Valley company has decided to concentrate on where it has the most muscle.
That would be devices that are especially tailored for playing videogames, building on the graphics technology for rendering three-dimensional images that has long been at the core of Nvidia's business.
Signs of a strategy shift have been increasingly evident in some of the company's recent statements, including remarks by Nvidia Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang at the company's annual technology conference in March.
In an interview after the release of first-quarter results last week, Mr. Huang said prioritizing graphics-oriented applications in mobile devices mirrors the targeted strategy the company has long used for products like personal computers. "We really focus on visual computing problems," Mr. Huang said.
The goal seemed broader two years ago. Nvidia's Tegra chips were selected for some high-profile tablets -- including a $249 seven-inch AsusTek model that Huang showed off at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show -- and Microsoft's original Surface tablet launched that year.
Smartphones were a tougher proposition. Rival Qualcomm, for one thing, has decades of experience in the cellular communications technology that often is combined on the same piece of silicon with calculating functions. Nvidia spent $367 million to buy the British chip company Icera to add wireless technology.
The two biggest smartphone makers, Apple and Samsung, have used Qualcomm's products for communications but favor their own processor chips.
Meanwhile, many other chip makers are targeting the mobile market, including Intel, MediaTek, Broadcom and Marvell.
Not that Nvidia's broader pitch to the mobile market hasn't paid some dividends. Last September, the fast-growing Chinese company Xiaomi selected the company's Tegra 4 processor for a smartphone. In France, Wiko Mobile earlier this year launched a handset with Nvidia's Tegra 4i chip, which includes LTE wireless capability. Nvidia also has shown success in getting Tegra selected for automotive applications.
Besides just selling chips, Nvidia has tried to spur interest among gamers with Shield, an unusual portable device with a display and game controllers, and a design for a tablet called the Tegra Note 7 being brought to market by hardware partners in several countries.
Yet the company doesn't seem eager to participate in parts of the market where low prices trump performance.
Rather, Mr. Huang is betting that Google's Android software is going to become a major target for game developers. And that should spur the creation of performance-oriented devices where Nvidia chips can shine.
"You are going to see us do some really great things in gaming on top of Tegra," he said.

NEW DELHI -- Microsoft Corp.'s cellphone unit on Monday launched a new midtier smartphone in India in an effort to recoup eroding market share in a critical developing market.
The phone, dubbed the Nokia Lumia 630, is aimed at a niche in between the premium models sold by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. and lower-end phones made by the likes of China's Xiaomi Inc. and India's Micromax Informatics Ltd.
When Microsoft took over Nokia Corp.'s handset business last month, it inherited the Finnish company's weakened competitive position in India, the world's second-largest telecommunications market, after China.
P. Balaji, managing director of Nokia India Sales Pvt. Ltd., a unit of Microsoft's Microsoft Mobiles Oy, said the Lumia 630 will be priced at just under $200 in the Indian market and will accommodate two SIM cards.
The sub-$200 price category "is the largest growth area for smartphones," said Mark C. Newman, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. In addition, he said, "dual-Sim phones are becoming more common in emerging markets."
Indian consumers have in recent years begun to favor dual-Sim phones so they can take advantage of different network operators' pricing deals and toggle between personal and business numbers on a single handset.
The new phone has a 4.5-inch screen and runs on Microsoft Corp's latest Windows 8.1 software. It will be available in retail stores starting Friday, the company said.

Phone Maker HTC Points Back to Black

TAIPEI -- Once a leading mobile-phone maker has been knocked off its throne, can it ever come back?
That is the question facing smartphone maker HTC Corp. as it forecast Tuesday a return to profit in the second quarter but warned its revenue would continue to fall.
For many handset makers, the track record isn't good. Experts say that few except Apple Inc. and Motorola Mobility have pulled off turnarounds, and Motorola's reprieve was temporary. In both cases, the key was producing megahit products: the iPhone and the Razr.
"Very few companies have been able to withstand this kind of spiral," said Alvin Kwock, J.P. Morgan's Asia head of technology hardware, adding that HTC will need an innovative product that competitors can't easily counter.
Just three years ago, HTC was the world's leading smartphone maker using Google Inc.'s Android operating system, but it has struggled in recent years to match sales with Samsung Electronics Co. and low-cost Chinese competitors. In March, the company unveiled a high-end flagship smartphone called the HTC One (M8). The device features a sleek metal design, and the company is betting that the new smartphone will help reverse declining sales.
Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said Tuesday that HTC is on the mend. The company has worked to smooth out supply-chain problems for its high-end devices, and has introduced smartphones priced as low as $145 this quarter as it begins to outsource some production to contract manufacturers in Taiwan and China to cut costs. It has also hired Samsung's former U.S. marketing chief, Paul Golden, as a consultant, in an effort to shore up marketing.
"We're seeing an encouraging sign, a good start. [The question is] how we sustain it," said Mr. Chang.
HTC said it expects to return to profit in the second quarter after three quarters of operating losses, but forecast revenue will fall to between 65 billion New Taiwan dollars and NT$70 billion (US$2.16 billion and US$2.32 billion), from NT$70.7 billion a year earlier. The company also said it is selling a 9.5% stake in a Chinese private-equity fund for US$69 million, which will result in a pretax gain of US$2 million in the second quarter.
HTC got its first big break in 2007 amid a product vacuum. After the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007, HTC was the first to provide a viable alternative based on the open-source Android operating system. The success helped HTC rise from a fledgling Taiwanese brand into the world's largest smartphone vendor by shipments in 2011.
"When HTC was doing well, it was because it had an early alternative to the iPhones, not because it had a strong global brand," said Willy Shih, a Harvard Business School professor who studies Asian technology companies.
HTC's fortunes changed when Samsung began to tap its massive marketing purse with the launch of its Galaxy smartphones and as an influx of low-cost Chinese competitors such as Xiaomi Inc. flooded the market. While HTC has sought to shore up its marketing to counter Samsung, it faces the reality of a shrinking budget.
Tighter finances have also made it more difficult for HTC to retain talent. Most recently, the company said design chief Scott Croyle has stepped down.
Analysts say HTC's prospects aren't so bleak for at least the next quarter or two because significant rivals like Apple haven't yet launched competing devices.
"HTC's supply-chain management is much better this year, so I think the second and third quarter should be OK," said Barclays analyst Dale Gai. "The challenge will be the fourth quarter."
Mr. Chang also said Tuesday that HTC is submitting for shareholder approval a plan to issue as many as five million restricted shares to employees. The company's shares rose 3.6% to close at NT$175 ahead of the announcement. Still, HTC's shares have lost more than 85% of their value since April 2011, and its global smartphone market share has slid to less than 2%, according to analysts' estimates. HTC's revenue fell to a five-year low in the first quarter.

HTC Starts Outsourcing Production To Cut Costs

TAIPEI -- HTC Corp. began to outsource production of some of its smartphones for the first time this quarter, looking to slash costs and better pursue new customers in developing markets.
The unprofitable Taiwanese smartphone maker has selected Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Compal Electronics Inc. and China's Wingtech Group for at least three of the new models in its midprice Desire series, said people familiar with the matter. Both assemblers began to mass produce smartphones for HTC this spring, the people said. Traditionally, HTC has produced all of its phones at its own factories.
The move accompanies other efforts by HTC to turn around its business. Chairwoman Cher Wang has taken a more active role in management in the past year, and the company recently hired Samsung Electronics Co.'s former U.S. marketing chief, Paul Golden, as a consultant to beef up its marketing.
HTC has long focused on high-end phones and resisted outsourcing, even as competitors from Apple Inc. to Nokia Corp. have turned to contract manufacturers to focus on design and save costs over the years. But as HTC struggles to hold its ground against Samsung and rapidly growing Chinese brands, it has decided to launch more low-price phones this year with the help of contract manufacturers.
Once the world's largest smartphone maker by shipments at its peak in 2011, HTC has contended with a stock slump of more than 86% amid unsuccessful marketing campaigns, supply-chain mishaps and growing competition. The mistakes brought HTC its second net loss on record in the first quarter, and it has fallen out of the world's top-10 smartphone makers since last year. The company's stock rose by the maximum daily limit of 6.9% on Monday to 169 New Taiwan dollars (US$5.59) on expectations that HTC would forecast a return to profit for the second quarter when it releases guidance on Tuesday.
HTC declined to comment.
Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in March that HTC was considering the possibility of using contract manufacturers, but that the company had no plans to outsource its flagship HTC One line or its key midprice phone, the Desire 816.
While it is keeping production of its most advanced devices in-house, HTC has outsourced a high-power smartphone aimed at the China market. Chinese contract manufacturer Wingtech, which also makes phones for Chinese brands such as Xiaomi Inc., is preparing to mass produce the Desire 616, which will run a fast eight-core processor made by budget chip maker Mediatek Inc., said two people familiar with the matter.
Wingtech also manufacturers HTC's least-expensive smartphone to date, the Desire 210, which was launched last month in India for 8,700 rupees (US$145), one of the people said.
Taiwan's Compal, which also supplies Nokia, began production in the second quarter of some HTC Desire series phones, another person said.

WSJ.D Technology: Little Payoff in Apple Trial

As Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. squabble in court over who copied whose phone features, the companies' grip over the smartphone industry is slipping.
The two companies account for nearly all smartphone hardware profits. But they are losing market share to Chinese rivals with lower-priced phones, particularly in developing nations.
Two years ago, Apple and Samsung accounted for more than 55% of world-wide smartphones shipments, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. In the first quarter, that fell to 47%. Samsung said Tuesday that quarterly operating profit at its mobile division fell from a year earlier for the first time since 2010. Apple's annual profit fell last year for the first time in more than a decade.
Compared with those shifts, the stakes in their high-profile courtroom dispute are surprisingly small. Apple's $930 million verdict in a prior case amounts to little more than one week of its profits; Apple has yet to collect a dime. Neither company has had to pull a meaningful product off the shelf.
For that, the companies have suffered through embarrassing revelations. Emails showed Apple bickering with its advertising agency after the firm suggested its brand was slipping. An Apple employee created a slide titled "Consumers Want What We Don't Have." Internal Samsung emails revealed executives saying that it was suffering a "crisis of design" and that the difference between its early smartphones and the iPhone was "heaven and earth."
The case is "a distraction," said Sundeep Bajikar, an analyst for Jefferies. "There are potentially more important structural changes happening in the industry," he added. "The implications are not that meaningful."
Attorneys for the two companies delivered closing arguments in the latest case Tuesday in U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif. Apple is seeking $2.2 billion from Samsung for infringing five of its software patents. Samsung has counter-sued Apple for infringing two of its patents and is seeking a mere $7 million.
"Bringing this lawsuit was Apple's last choice," said Apple's lawyer Harold McElhinny, adding that it first asked Samsung to stop infringing its patents in 2010. "Apple simply cannot walk away from its inventions."
Samsung's lawyers said Apple should recharge its growth through new products instead of stifling competition through the legal system. "What Apple needs to understand is that the answer to the innovator's dilemma is not here in the courtroom suing people," said Samsung's lawyer John Quinn.
As the lawyers argue for yesterday's profits, rivals are moving to crack the Apple-Samsung duopoly over the smartphone industry. The current field is pretty fragmented, with nobody else controlling more than 5% of the smartphone market. Microsoft Corp. last week finished swallowing Nokia Corp., replicating Apple by uniting hardware and software. Lenovo Group Ltd., one of China's biggest smartphone manufacturers, is in the process of acquiring Google Inc.'s Motorola unit to expand its global reach. Xiaomi Inc., the smartphone startup that has rocked China with low-priced phones and wildly loyal customers, plans to move into 10 emerging markets this year, including India, Indonesia, Russia and Turkey.
As the field grows more competitive, market growth is slowing. World-wide smartphone sales increased 38% last year to more than one billion units, according to market researcher IDC. This year's growth is expected to be half that rate. The bulk of the expansion is coming in developing nations, which tend to favor lower-price handsets over the high-end models that drive Apple's and Samsung's bottom lines.
Litigation is a particularly fraught strategy in technology, where the pace of innovation is so quick that a once-key feature can become obsolete in a few years.
Consider the "swipe to unlock" feature at issue in the current trial. When it was introduced with the first iPhone in 2007, it was a simple, novel way to prevent people from accidently unlocking touchscreen handsets. However, Apple's latest iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy S5 use fingerprint sensors to offer a more secure way to start the device.
On the hardware side, the processor that powers the latest iPhone is 56-times as powerful as that of the original iPhone introduced six years earlier.
By comparison, the companies' patent disputes move at a snail's pace. Apple first filed suit against Samsung in April 2011. The trial began in August 2012. A retrial to determine the damages owed by Samsung was completed in November 2013. The suit in the latest trial was filed two years ago.
This means that even if one party is found to have copied, the most meaningful penalty that the court can assess -- an injunction blocking sales of an infringing product -- is largely neutered because those products now sell in small quantities, or not at all. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, who has presided over both Apple-Samsung trials, has rebuffed nearly all of Apple's efforts for an injunction.
"Generally, these cases only make economic sense if you can get an injunction," said Brian Love, a patent law expert and an assistant professor of law at Santa Clara University. "It continues to amaze me that this case hasn't settled."

While holding strong in the high-end of the market, Apple's share fell to 15.3% from 17.5% in the year-ago period. Strategy Analytics said Apple's lack of a new entry-level smartphone¡Xthe company tends to discount its older models instead of offering new lower-end products¡Xis hurting it in fast-growing regions like Latin America.
Smartphone prices are tumbling, further pressuring profitability for both companies. IDC says the average selling prices of smartphones fell 18% globally to $335 in 2013; it forecasts another 8% decline in 2014.
Litigation is a particularly fraught strategy in technology, where the pace of innovation is so quick that a once-key feature can become obsolete in a few years.
Consider the "swipe to unlock" feature at issue in the current trial. When it was introduced with the first iPhone in 2007, it was a simple, novel way to prevent people from accidently unlocking touchscreen handsets. However, Apple's latest iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy S5 use fingerprint sensors to offer a more secure way to start the device.
On the hardware side, the processor that powers the latest iPhone is 56-times as powerful as that of the original iPhone introduced six years earlier.
By comparison, the companies' patent disputes move at a snail's pace. Apple first filed suit against Samsung in April 2011. The trial began in August 2012. A retrial to determine the damages owed by Samsung was completed in November 2013. The suit in the latest trial was filed two years ago.
This means that even if one party is found to have copied, the most meaningful penalty that the court can assess¡Xan injunction blocking sales of an infringing product¡Xis largely neutered because those products now sell in small quantities, or not at all. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, who has presided over both Apple-Samsung trials, has rebuffed nearly all of Apple's efforts for an injunction.
"Generally, these cases only make economic sense if you can get an injunction," said Brian Love, a patent law expert and an assistant professor of law at Santa Clara University. "It continues to amaze me that this case hasn't settled."
The way Apple runs its business makes a settlement more difficult. Other companies license their technology, and go to court in part to fight over the terms. But Apple aims to differentiate its products by keeping its technology for itself, leaving it at the mercy of the courts.
"It's a waste of time," said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. "It's been proven over time that litigation doesn't get you anywhere with technology."

Shopping in China: Are Any of These Real?; In Looking for a Xiaomi Phone, Fakes Outnumber Authentic Ones

About a year ago, I got a lesson in how ubiquitous and sophisticated counterfeits are in China.
It started with a shopping expedition for a Xiaomi phone in Zhongguancun (pronounced jong-gwan-tsun), Beijing's foremost electronics district.
Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's popular handsets offer top-end hardware at a relatively low price, and fun and customizable software. The only caveat: They are hard to get. Xiaomi sells a lot of its phones online, but their official website is often sold out. When my girlfriend asked me to help her buy one, we headed to Zhongguancun.
Zhongguancun is full of aggressive, grabby hawkers, but also official resellers of big-name brands, both domestic and foreign. We fought our way through the laptop and camera salespeople to the area where smartphones were sold.
There were ads for Xiaomi everywhere we looked. We found a friendly seller, negotiated a price for a brand new Xiaomi, and headed home triumphant.
Back at my apartment, our sense of triumph evaporated. There was something wrong with the phone. The system refused to update, apps started crashing, all sorts of details were off. The camera had the wrong number of megapixels. The storage capacity was wrong. The app store was named "Feiliu" instead of "Mi Market."
After some research on the Internet I understood what was wrong. We had been fooled. The phone was a knockoff.
We charged back to Zhongguancun, found the seller, and got a refund.
On our way out, we came across a more reputable looking store with a sign advertising Xiaomi phones and decided to try again.
The store could have been an Apple shop, with its clean surfaces and white lights. The young clerk brought out a Xiaomi box and opened it up. I asked to try the phone out. Armed with my new-found knowledge of fake Xiaomis, I navigated to the app store to check the name. It was "Feiliu."
"It's a fake," I said.
"Oh, you want the real one?" The seller seemed surprised. "You know, they're more expensive."
We told him we did, indeed, want a real one. He made several calls, went off and came back with another box. I checked the phone and everything was in order. Mission accomplished.
Xiaomi wasn't immediately available for comment.
A few months later, we decided to get a Xiaomi for my girlfriend's sister. Again, we headed to Zhongguancun.
We found a new seller, who brought out a phone. I immediately outed it as a fake. The seller got another phone. I checked the app store and storage capacity, and all seemed well.
It wasn't until we took that second phone home that we realized we had been upgraded to a better grade of fake.
This time, it was much harder to identify. I followed an online guide for detecting fakes, which instructed me to boot the phone in recovery mode. What should have loaded was Xiaomi's custom Mi-recovery software. Instead, I got a text-based menu that the online guide identified as a tell for counterfeits.
We headed back to Zhongguancun, and found the seller.
"It's not real," I said.
"It's a real phone," he answered, splitting hairs.
Eventually, he relented and conceded I was right. He wouldn't give a refund, but offered to replace the phone with an authentic Xiaomi if we paid the difference.
We took the phone home and subjected it to all the tests of the online guide. It checked out.
But a few days after we gave the phone to my girlfriend's sister, it started having problems. When I examined it, I heard an electric pop, and the screen went blank.
It was a real Xiaomi phone... but it was defective.

Corporate News: Delayed Teslas Upset Buyers in China --- Furor Reflects Difficulties Auto Makers Face in Selling New-Energy Vehicles in Major Asian Market
By Colum Murphy

(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   
BEIJING -- A group of disgruntled Tesla Motors Inc. customers in China is protesting delayed deliveries of their cars one day before the electric-vehicle maker is set to make its first China delivery.
The furor underscores the challenges facing auto makers in marketing new-energy vehicles in China, which so far hasn't delivered on the promise of becoming a major new market for electric cars.
Tesla's launch had been heralded as a possible catalyst that could push China further down the electric-car path. The Palo Alto, Calif., company said in January that it would sell its Model S for $121,000 in China and compete with luxury brands like BMW AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi. Tesla is set on Tuesday to hand over the company's first Model S to a buyer in China at a high-profile event that is scheduled to feature Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.
Now, some once-enthusiastic customers like Sam Long are unhappy with the reason he says Tesla is offering to explain the delivery delays. "The company told me they are still training electricians in Zhuhai," said Mr. Long, referring to the southern Chinese city where he lives. "I feel my rights have been hurt."
Mr. Long, a 37-year-old businessman, said he ordered his Model S last year, but that as of Monday, the Tesla website showed his car has yet to be manufactured. Mr. Long and 22 other consumers who booked Tesla cars have recently hired attorneys to negotiate with Tesla over the delivery, he said.
Tesla spokesman Simon Sproule said the company wouldn't ship to customers outside the major cities of Beijing and Shanghai until June because of a lack of service centers and charging considerations. "You would never sell any brand unless you have the tools to service it," he said.
Mr. Sproule added that the company is in an "ongoing dialogue" with the customers. (In the U.S., some Tesla buyers have waited for as long as three or four months to get their cars.)
Tesla doesn't report order numbers, only deliveries on a quarterly basis, Mr. Sproule said. In a January interview, Mr. Musk said he would consider it a success if Tesla sold 5,000 vehicles or more in China this year.
China has set itself the ambitious goal of putting 500,000 plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles on the road by next year and five million by 2020. Beijing hopes so-called green cars will help battle chronic pollution and give a much-needed boost to Chinese auto makers by encouraging them to pioneer such vehicles. Such cars could also help reduce the country's dependency on imported oil.
Now China looks increasingly like it will miss its goal. In 2013, about 1,005 plug-in hybrids and 11,410 electric vehicles were sold in the country, according to data from consultancy Automotive Foresight.
Central and local governments offer generous incentives to encourage consumers to buy environmentally friendly cars made by certain Chinese car manufacturers. Some cities exempt car buyers from expensive license-plate fees, which some municipalities impose in an effort to reduce traffic.
But a significant stumbling block is the lack of charging infrastructure in China. There is still a dearth of public places to recharge cars -- the city of Shanghai for example has only a few hundred charging stations, according to Andreas Graef, principal at consultancy A.T. Kearney's office there. Prohibitive investment costs and low financial returns mean state utility providers have little incentive to build the stations, although there are signs this might change as the providers reach out to more private investors, he said.
Issues related to individual charging facilities, whether at home or the office, appear to be a factor explaining Chinese buyers' current displeasure with Tesla.
But Tesla said that, in China, as long as a customer has a designated parking space -- in an apartment building, an individual house or at a workplace -- its service technicians will provide the customer with a secure electrical wiring plan and help install the wall connector.
"We'll also work with property management to find a solution that everyone is happy with. We work with the customer to make sure they have a proper charging option as part of the sales-and-delivery process," Mr. Sproule said.
Tesla is recruiting and training electricians so customers can pay to have them help with charging, he said.
Mr. Graef also said typical new-energy vehicles are less comfortable and spacious compared with more popular cars in China such as sport-utility vehicles.
He added that the Beijing auto show, currently taking place, offers encouraging signs that more appealing new-energy vehicles are in the pipeline from car manufacturers, citing an electric vehicle developed by Daimler AG and Chinese car company BYD Co.
Fans of Tesla in China include some of the country's most prominent executives, such as Lei Jun, founder of Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi Inc. Last year, Mr. Lei posted a photo online of his meeting with Mr. Musk.

Corporate News: TPG-Led Investment Puts Airbnb's Value at $10 Billion

A group led by private-equity firm TPG has finalized an agreement to invest more than $450 million in Airbnb Inc., valuing the home-rental site at $10 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The funding round makes Airbnb one of the world's most valuable startups, matching investors' price tags for file-storage company Dropbox Inc. and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. Airbnb, which lets people rent their homes to travelers, is also now valued higher than large publicly traded hotel chains Wyndham Worldwide Corp. and Hyatt Hotels Corp.
The investor group also includes investment firm Dragoneer Investment Group, mutual fund T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital. TPG Growth, the buyout firm's middle-market and growth-equity arm, and Dragoneer are expected to invest roughly $75 million apiece in Airbnb as part of the deal, the people said. Sequoia, an earlier Airbnb investor, is expected to invest about $85 million, they said.
The deal includes some so-called downside protections for the investor group should Airbnb's value decrease in a future deal, the people said. The details of those terms weren't immediately learned.
Investors are betting on Airbnb's potential to disrupt the multibillion-dollar hospitality industry. Its service gives budget travelers an alternative to hotels by letting them rent people's couches, rooms, apartments and houses. Homeowners gain a new source of income, and Airbnb collects a small portion of the nightly rate.
The six-year-old company, which previously raised more than $300 million in capital, is padding its coffers as it prepares to expand globally and add more services for travelers. Earlier this year, Airbnb began testing a cleaning service for hosts in certain neighborhoods of San Francisco and New York.
Airbnb also needs financial ammunition to battle a powerful hotel industry and scrutiny from regulators, and to cover costly damages from thefts and vandalism. Hotels argue that the company's rentals unfairly skirt lodging taxes and should be held to the same fire codes and other regulations. Regulators, meanwhile, are concerned about safety, oversight and tax collections.
Last October, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information on its 15,000 hosts in the state, to determine if any are violating a 2010 state law that prohibits renters from subletting their homes for more than 30 days if they aren't present. The company is contesting the order in state Supreme Court, which has scheduled a hearing to begin April 22.
Airbnb, which operates in about 32,000 cities, has said in recent weeks that it is aiming to start collecting taxes from renters on behalf of hosts in New York, San Francisco and Portland, Ore.

Hon Hai Profit Rises 13%, Boosted By iPads and iPhones; Taiwan Manufacturer Also Announces New Investment and Fundraising Plans

HONG KONG¡XHon Hai Precision Industry Co., the biggest assembler of Apple Inc. products, said Friday its profit last year rose 13%, helped by an increase in iPad and iPhone sales.
The world's largest contract manufacturer for electronics, commonly known as Foxconn Technology Group, also unveiled nearly $90 million in investments in manufacturing and software development in China, as well as two fundraising measures, as it girds for tougher competition and a possible sales slowdown. Its sales last year rose just 1%.
Taiwan-based Hon Hai, which earns more than 40% of its revenue from Apple, has been seeking new avenues of growth, as income from contract manufacturing slows. The company has been making a push into software development and telecommunications services, as well as entering the retail market by selling its mobile accessories under its own Coverbank brand.
Hon Hai's 2013 profit was 106.70 billion new Taiwan dollars ($3.5 billion), up from NT$94.76 billion a year earlier. Its revenue edged up to 3.95 trillion new Taiwan dollars from NT$3.91 trillion.
Hon Hai's results were underpinned by demand from Apple, which sold 51 million iPhones in last year's final quarter, up 7% from a year earlier. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company also sold a record 26 million iPads in the quarter, up from 22.9 million.
But Apple has been facing stiff competition, and there is growing skepticism that it can repeat its successful innovations in new product categories¡Xas it did with the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010.
Faced with the possibility of a slowdown in orders from its biggest customer, Hon Hai has been busy finding ways of trimming costs to operate more efficiently and improve its profit margin.
The company, which employs over one million factory workers across China, is accelerating automation of factories, announcing plans on Friday to invest $15 million in a robot-manufacturing and sales unit in China. The company also said it will invest $30 million in a software-development unit and another $42 million to set up a new trading-and-manufacturing unit for components in China.
Hon Hai is also expanding manufacturing in lower-cost inland China, building facilities in the central and western provinces of Chengdu, Wuhan and Zhengzhou. In those areas, the typical wage could be two-thirds or less of levels for the more-developed coastal provinces, analysts said.
Hon Hai said it plans to raise funds by selling global depositary receipts to replenish its working capital. Such receipts are used as a proxy for stock, letting companies raise money in markets where their securities don't trade.
Hon Hai also said it will issue up to NT$24 billion in corporate bonds to repay short-term debt. The company didn't provide a timetable, or a value for the global depositary receipt issue.
A turnaround at its handset manufacturing unit, FIH Mobile Ltd., also helped boost the company's earnings. Hong Kong-listed FIH Mobile, which serves customers besides Apple, said last week it swung to a full-year net profit of $77.7 million after reporting net losses for the past four years.
FIH Mobile had reported losses as major customers such as Nokia Corp. and Motorola Mobility continued to lose ground in the fast-growing smartphone market. However, in a bid to turn around its operations, FIH recently signed on new customers, including BlackBerry Ltd. and China's Xiaomi Inc., a startup that has rocked the Chinese smartphone market
Earlier this week, smaller rival Pegatron Corp. said its fourth-quarter profit rose 22% as the company benefited from its growing role as an Apple assembler. Although Pegatron previously made some older iPhone models, last year was the first time Pegatron was the primary manufacturer of a new iPhone model, the 5C, according to people familiar with the matter.

Value of Site That Turns Homes Into Hotels Nears $10 Billion

Airbnb Inc., which once sold novelty cereal boxes to stay afloat before emerging as a threat to the hotel industry, is close to becoming one of the world's most valuable startups.
The online service that lets people rent their homes to travelers is in advanced talks to raise capital that would value it at about $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Private-equity firm TPG and boutique investment firm Dragoneer Investment Group are leading the funding round, which could total between $400 million and $500 million, these people said. Mutual funds including T. Rowe Price Group Inc. are expected to be part of the investment group, the people said. Fidelity Investments is also in discussions to join the group, the people said.
The negotiations between the various investment groups and Airbnb remain fluid and could fall apart, these people cautioned.
The rich price tag reflects Airbnb's potential to disrupt the hotel industry. In six years, the company has become a required destination for millions of tourists looking for cheap rooms, while giving homeowners a new source of income. It is part of a trend of technology startups -- including car-sharing service Uber Technologies Inc. -- creating markets by letting people share excess resources.
The company could be worth more than Wyndham Worldwide Corp., which manages 7,500 hotels under the Wyndham, Ramada and other brands, and is valued at $9.3 billion. Hyatt Hotels Corp., has a market value of $8.4 billion.
Airbnb's growth has drawn scrutiny from regulators wary about safety, oversight and tax collections. The company has also attracted the ire of hotel operators, who argue that the rentals unfairly skirt lodging taxes and aren't held to the same fire codes and other regulations.
Last October, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information on its 15,000 hosts in the state, to determine if any are violating a 2010 state law that prohibits renters from subletting their homes for more than 30 days if they're not present. The company is contesting the order in court.
Airbnb doesn't own any property rented on its service, employ bellhops or serve any continental breakfasts. Instead, the service has created an alternative to hotels by turning individuals into hoteliers, allowing hosts to rent their couches, rooms, apartments and homes through an online marketplace. Hosts set a nightly rate, and Airbnb collects guests' payments, keeping a small portion of the fees for itself.
The quality of accommodations isn't as standardized as the hotels listed on sites like Priceline.com, but within Airbnb's marketplace, there is the opportunity to find a quirky property -- a treehouse in Hawaii, a houseboat with a view of the Eiffel Tower, or simply a cheaper bed.
Founded in 2008, Airbnb is a classic rags-to-riches Silicon Valley startup story. As new transplants to San Francisco struggling to pay rent, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia rented out air mattresses in their apartment during a bustling conference in a bid to make extra money. The informal arrangement became a website called Airbedandbreakfast.com. But it wasn't a rocket ship at first. CEO Mr. Chesky -- a designer -- didn't fit the mold of the typical engineer and many venture capitalists were wary of the unorthodox business model.
To get by, the company designed and sold cereal boxes of then presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain, from which it made tens of thousands of dollars. The move impressed Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley incubator, who accepted them into his program in 2009.
The company has since expanded its rental service to more than 600,000 listings in more than 190 countries, doubling revenue last year to about $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Airbnb last raised funding at a valuation of $2.5 billion in 2012, from venture-capital investors including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital.
Beyond room rentals, Airbnb expects to add an array of hospitality services. Earlier this year, Airbnb began testing a cleaning service for hosts in certain neighborhoods in San Francisco and New York.
Top executives at the large hotel brands, for the most part, have played down any rivalry between the industry and Airbnb. When they have complained, those gripes have centered on fairness and guest safety.
But smaller hotel operators are starting to speak out. "These guys are scofflaws," said Vijay Dandapani, president of New York hotel chain Apple Core Hotels. "There's no reason why they should be subjected to a completely different set of rules than the legacy hotel businesses."
As a huge marketplace with little control over its users, Airbnb has also had to grapple with hosts or guests behaving badly. After a smattering of thefts and vandalism, Airbnb put in place a $1 million insurance policy for hosts. Still, headlines of guests running amok continue to plague the startup. Earlier this month, a host said one guest turned his Manhattan apartment into the site of a sex party, which led to tens of thousands of dollars in property damage. Airbnb reimbursed the owner for his losses.
Even with these challenges, Airbnb could command one of the richest valuations for a company backed by venture capital.
In the past 12 months, at least 22 companies have raised new funds that valued them at $1 billion or more. At the top of that list, online-storage provider Dropbox Inc. and Chinese mobile-phone maker Xiaomi Inc. notched $10 billion valuations last year. Uber, which is unsettling the taxi industry by turning qualified car owners into chauffeurs, was valued last year at $3.8 billion following an investment from a group including TPG.

HONG KONG -- Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. are the dominant smartphone brands in the U.S. and in many other parts of the world. But in China, the world's biggest smartphone market, there isn't a clear winner yet.
Virtually unheard of outside China, several homegrown brands are gaining ground and seeking to challenge the technology giants' duopoly. Working in their favor: advanced hardware at lower prices, strong relationship with Chinese carriers, as well as creative ways to build a fan base through social media and online forums.
Hundreds of millions of Chinese mobile users still haven't replaced their basic phones, making the country a critical battleground for global smartphone brands at a time when growth is slowing in the U.S. and other mature markets.
Research firm Canalys estimates that smartphone shipments in China totaled 354 million units last year -- compared with 139 million units in the U.S. Canalys expects Chinese shipments to increase to 422 million units this year.
Zhou Cheng, a 25-year-old shop manager in the southern province of Hunan, recently purchased his first smartphone to replace his old Nokia handset. He spent nearly $500 for the Oppo Find 5 from Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp., based in Dongguan. The device runs on Google Inc.'s Android operating system, and comes with a 13-megapixel camera and a 5-inch high-resolution screen that has more pixels per inch than Apple's new iPhone 5S.
"It looks good and works well," Mr. Zhou says, describing Oppo as cooler than other Chinese smartphone brands such as Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. "Oppo is for young people and its phones are more stylish." The Find 5, which is about 30% cheaper than Apple's entry-level iPhone 5C in China, also fit his budget.
Mr. Zhou is one of many Chinese consumers that companies like Oppo, Coolpad and Xiaomi Inc. are targeting. Their growing presence is creating a more challenging environment for foreign brands such as Apple and Samsung.
China's mobile market is so big that some local handset vendors, despite focusing mainly on the domestic market, already sell more smartphones overall than global competitors. In the third quarter of last year, Coolpad, the smartphone brand of China's Yulong Computer Telecommunication Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., was the sixth-biggest smartphone vendor by units sold world-wide, ahead of Nokia Corp. and Sony Corp., according to Canalys.
In China itself, Coolpad ranked third with a market share of 11%, behind Samsung's 21% and Lenovo's 13%. Apple came in fifth with 6%.
Apple will likely get a boost in China this year after China Mobile Ltd., the country's largest carrier with more than 760 million subscribers, started selling iPhones for the first time on Jan. 17.
Still, analysts said the higher upfront costs of China Mobile's iPhone contracts -- compared with those at other Chinese carriers -- could deter many price-conscious consumers.
Coolpad, which started out in 1993 as a maker of pagers and telecom equipment, is now one of the more established players in China's mobile industry. Its strength lies in its close business ties with all major Chinese telecom carriers, which help distribute its phones outside major urban centers such as Sichuan and Hunan.
One of Coolpad's most popular phones, the Coolpad 9080W, comes with a 5.7-inch screen, an 8-megapixel camera and a quad-core processor, even though it sells for about $260.
Coolpad says it is trying to attract millions of first-time smartphone users in China. Its parent company reported that its first-half profit in 2013 rose 40% to 212.8 million Hong Kong dollars (US$27.4 million) from HK$152.5 million in 2012.
"When first-time smartphone users have a good experience with our phones, they may buy more expensive Coolpad models later when their purchasing power increases," said Coolpad Vice President Zhang Guang-qiang in an interview.
Some analysts are skeptical about Coolpad's strategy, noting it will be a big challenge to raise its brand and convince consumers to pay more for its handsets.
Apple remains one of the most desirable brands in China, as local consumers' recent frenzy over the gold-colored iPhone 5S indicated. Samsung, a household name in China because of its TV sets, sells smartphones that cost less than $200 to compete against local handset vendors.
Apple and Samsung declined to comment about competition in China.
Executives from Chinese smartphone makers say their companies are well positioned to understand the local market and cater to the needs of specific types of Chinese consumers.
Oppo, which has previously used actor Leonardo DiCaprio in its ads and promoted its phones through tie-ins with local TV shows, has been particularly successful in attracting young female customers.
The private company doesn't disclose earnings, though it said it makes a profit from smartphones.
Beijing-based Xiaomi is another Chinese smartphone vendor known for its marketing savvy. The company, founded in 2010, has since created a cultlike fan base among techie types who are often early adopters of new gadgets.
Xiaomi, which doesn't disclose whether it is profitable, sells its phones mainly through its own website, and offers an array of accessories including multicolored batteries and dolls. It builds brand loyalty in part by constantly tweaking its version of the Android operating system with suggestions from users and by offering weekly updates.
"If you give us a suggestion, and we quickly change it, you will have a long-lasting sense of achievement," said Xiaomi founder Lei Jun in an interview. In the third quarter, Xiaomi was the No. 6 smartphone vendor in China, slightly behind Apple, according to Canalys.
Social media has played a role in Xiaomi's popularity. Mr. Lei, who has been often compared with Apple's late founder Steve Jobs for his presentation style at product releases, has close to eight million followers on Sina Weibo.
Looking to expand its business overseas, Xiaomi last year hired Hugo Barra, who was an executive at Google's Android business. Mr. Barra said earlier this month that Xiaomi would expand into Singapore.
The success of Xiaomi and Oppo made other Chinese companies see the importance of marketing and social media.
Coolpad's Mr. Zhang said that the company's executives have become more active on social-media platforms like Sina Weibo and on the Chinese smartphone messaging service WeChat.
"Being a software engineer, I didn't talk to users and media several years ago," said Mr. Zhang. "But the market has changed a lot. Now I always interact with users on my Weibo," said Mr. Zhang, who has more than 275,000 followers on the microblog.
Coolpad has won fans including Yang Guang, an 18-year-old student in Guangzhou who bought the Coolpad 9070 smartphone several months ago.
"Only a minority of students from wealthy families can afford to buy expensive foreign-brand smartphones," said Mr. Yang.

HONG KONG¡XApple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. are the dominant smartphone brands in the U.S. and in many other parts of the world. But in China, the world's biggest smartphone market, there isn't a clear winner yet.
Virtually unheard of outside China, several homegrown brands are gaining ground and seeking to challenge the technology giants' duopoly. Working in their favor: advanced hardware at lower prices, strong relationship with Chinese carriers, as well as creative ways to build a fan base through social media and online forums.
Hundreds of millions of Chinese mobile users still haven't replaced their basic phones, making the country a critical battleground for global smartphone brands at a time when growth is slowing in the U.S. and other mature markets.
Research firm Canalys estimates that smartphone shipments in China totaled 354 million units last year¡Xcompared with 139 million units in the U.S. Canalys expects Chinese shipments to increase to 422 million units this year.
Zhou Cheng, a 25-year-old shop manager in the southern province of Hunan, recently purchased his first smartphone to replace his old Nokia handset. He spent nearly $500 for the Oppo Find 5 from Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp., based in Dongguan. The device runs on Google Inc.'s Android operating system, and comes with a 13-megapixel camera and a 5-inch high-resolution screen that has more pixels per inch than Apple's new iPhone 5S.
"It looks good and works well," Mr. Zhou says, describing Oppo as cooler than other Chinese smartphone brands such as Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. "Oppo is for young people and its phones are more stylish." The Find 5, which is about 30% cheaper than Apple's entry-level iPhone 5C in China, also fit his budget.

Apple will likely get a boost in China this year after China Mobile Ltd., the country's largest carrier with more than 760 million subscribers, started selling iPhones for the first time on Jan. 17. Earlier this month, China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua said the carrier had received preorders for more than a million iPhones since it started accepting them in late December.
Apple on Monday reported a 29% increase in its revenue in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan combined for the quarter ended Dec. 28. The company didn't disclose its iPhone sales in China, but Chief Executive Tim Cook said, "We've been selling with China Mobile now for about a week. And last week was the best week for activations we've ever had in China."
Still, analysts said the higher upfront costs of China Mobile's iPhone contracts¡Xcompared with those at other Chinese carriers¡Xcould deter many price-conscious consumers.
