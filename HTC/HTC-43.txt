<title:>HTC Hints at Waterproof Camera

HTC Corp. is answering the question investors have asked for several years: Can you give us something new?
While HTC's smartphones have garnered critical plaudits, it hasn't been enough for it to battle the marketing power of Samsung Electronics Co. The smartphone-focused Taiwanese firm's sales have continued to slide, despite continued rollouts of highly rated smartphones.
HTC this week released a video teasing what is apparently a waterproof camera to be launched Oct. 8. The video is shot from the camera's perspective and doesn't show the camera itself, but the footage suggests it can be attached to a person while playing sports, zoom in for selfies and go underwater.
The device presents a hope to investors for an HTC comeback after three years of sliding sales and falling smartphone market share. It also comes as HTC is looking for ways to diversify beyond smartphones, such as plans to launch its first tablet since 2011.
HTC will be going up against several established action-camera vendors, such as GoPro, which began selling its cameras in 2004. However, while the GoPro looks somewhat like a traditional camera, HTC's may stand apart with a sleek, periscope-like design, according to unverified pictures circulating online.
Bloomberg reported in September that HTC was working on a waterproof camera to challenge GoPro.
Market research firm Futuresource Consulting estimates that the action camera market will grow to nine million units in 2018 from almost five million units last year.
