New data from ComScore, the market research company, makes one thing very clear: In the brutal smartphone market, being No. 3 is not something to brag about.
Motorola Mobility, which Google recently said it would sell to the Chinese computer maker Lenovo, was a distant third in the American smartphone market, following Apple and Samsung, according to data from ComScore. In December, Motorola had roughly 7 percent of the market, compared to Apple with about 42 percent and Samsung with about 26 percent.
ComScore's data was similar to the results in a recent NPD Group study, which also found Motorola in a distant third place.
Apple and Samsung have dominated the American smartphone market for years now, leaving contenders like Motorola, HTC and Nokia to fight for the No. 3 spot.
But even though Motorola got there, it was still bleeding Google's money. In the fourth quarter, Motorola reported a loss of $384 million, after sales of its high-end smartphone, the Moto X, were disappointing.
Now that Google plans to sell Motorola to Lenovo, whose smartphones have been successful in China, it remains to be seen if the Chinese company can take Motorola's No. 3 position and turn it into actual profit. Problem is, the high end of the United States smartphone market is already saturated with Samsung and Apple phones, meaning Lenovo might have to target the low end of the market, which has smaller profit margins.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
