YUKOS
Russia Must Compensate
Shareholders, Says EU Court
Russia has to pay the former owners of now defunct Russian oil company Yukos 1.87 billion euros ($2.51 billion) in compensation for unfair tax proceedings, the European Court of Human Rights said Thursday.
The ruling on compensation is the ECHR's biggest award to date and comes three years after the court first found that Moscow had violated Yukos's rights to a fair trial and protection of property.
Russia has to pay 1.87 billion euros in compensation for the direct financial damage that Yukos's owners suffered from the unlawful proceeding, which the court said should go to Yukos's former shareholders and their heirs.
Moscow also has to reimburse an extra 300,000 euros in legal costs to the Yukos International Foundation, a company that now houses some of Yukos's remaining assets.
In a blow to Yukos's former owners, however, the court rejected its claim that the unfair tax proceedings led to its liquidation in 2007.
It is because of this assessment that the 1.87 billion euros award falls well short of the 37.98 billion euros in damages Yukos had asked for. It is also significantly less than the $50 billion in damages that its former owners were awarded by a Netherlands-based tribunal this week.

HTC
Smartphone Maker Expects
Continued Decline in Sales
HTC Corp. forecast continued falling sales in the third quarter, as the Taiwanese high-end smartphone maker faces a challenge from the coming launch of Apple Inc.'s next-generation iPhone.
It will be HTC's 12th straight quarter of falling revenue on an annual basis. Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said the flagship HTC One (M8) smartphone and other products launched in the first half of the year helped boost second-quarter earnings, but sales will slow in the third quarter and the company will need to trim sales and marketing expenses.
HTC will remain profitable in the third quarter, Mr. Chang said.
"Some of our products, after the initial excitement, have settled at a lower level," said Mr. Chang on an investor call. "But the good thing is it is stabilized."
Mr. Chang added he expects HTC to break its three-year slide in revenue in the fourth quarter, with the help of momentum from the flagship line and the introduction of new products.

EXXON MOBIL
Earnings Jump by 28%, But Production Declines
Exxon Mobil Corp. said its profit for the second quarter rose 28%, even though the company pumped oil and natural gas at the lowest rate in almost five years.
The U.S.-based energy company was buoyed by higher oil prices, lifting its earnings to $8.78 billion on revenue of $111.65 billion. It also got a boost from higher profits for refining crude and manufacturing chemicals. But its oil and gas output sank 5.7% from a year earlier, the lowest rate since the third quarter of 2009.
The company has said it is weighing the impact of sanctions against Russia announced this week by the U.S. and the European Union, which aim to restrict exports of energy technologies for oil projects.

DIAGEO
China Slowdown Hits Profit
Diageo PLC, the world's biggest liquor company by sales, on Thursday posted an 8.2% decline in full-year profit, attributing the decline to a collapse of demand in China -- where sales of high-price Johnnie Walker Black Label fell nearly 30% -- and problems in other emerging markets.
Diageo reported net profit of GBP 2.25 billion ($3.81 billion), compared with GBP 2.45 billion a year earlier, as revenue dropped 8.5% to GBP 13.98 billion. Sales in China fell 33%, but there was an improved performance in Western Europe.
