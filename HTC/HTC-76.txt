Beats Music, a new on-demand music streaming service that will rival Spotify AB and a host of newer challengers, will debut in January, after more than a year in development, the company said.
A division of Beats Electronics LLC, the high-end headphone company founded by music mogul Jimmy Iovine and rap star Dr. Dre, the new subscription service aims to differentiate itself from the competition by aggressively helping users find new or unfamiliar music.
"There's an ocean of music out there," said Mr. Iovine in an interview at The Wall Street Journal's D: Dive Into Media conference earlier this year. "And there's absolutely no curation for it."
Beats hasn't elaborated on how it plans to guide users, but it has named several of the music-industry veterans it has hired to help. They include Julie Pilat, a former programming executive at Clear Channel Communications Inc., who was music director for Los Angeles pop station KIIS-FM; hip-hop radio personality Fuzzy Fantabulous; and music writer Ken Tucker. Nine Inch Nails front man Trent Reznor serves as chief creative officer.
Beats bought an existing streaming service, called Mog, in July 2012, and several months later it hired as its new chief executive Ian Rogers, a digital music pioneer who launched his career working for the Beastie Boys.
Google Inc. launched its Google Play All Access streaming service in the spring and is preparing to launch a separate YouTube music streaming service soon that will also cost about $10 a month, a typical price for such services
Beats' streaming-service launch follows a fresh infusion of cash from Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private-equity firm, which is investing $500 million for a minority stake in Beats as Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp. sells its stake.
