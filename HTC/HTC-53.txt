[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
"Designed by Apple in California" is a slogan familiar to anyone with an iPhone. But the U.S. technology giant's recent moves underscore its increasing reliance on growth abroad.
Apple said on Tuesday that Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer will retire after a decade in the post. His successor is Luca Maestri, who joined only a year ago after two years as the CFO of Xerox. He also has deep international experience at firms such as NokiaSiemens and the overseas divisions of General Motors. Apple took pains to emphasize Mr. Maestri's overseas resume and it is noteworthy that it handpicked an outsider rather than promote from within.
This came a day after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is on a hiring spree in Asia, luring people from firms such as HTC to speed up development of devices like the iPhone. Sources told the Journal that Apple's operations staff and engineers in China now top 600.
Apple has changed a lot since Mr. Oppenheimer took the CFO job. Revenue is up more than 20-fold and now owes most to iPhones rather than Macs. But while Apple has become a global force, domestic growth is slowing. In 2004, nearly half of revenue came from its Americas segment, and 84 of its 86 retail stores were located in the U.S. Now, the Americas segment accounts for 37% of revenue, and 40% of its retail stores are foreign. And about 78% Apple's $159 billion cash hoard now sits offshore.
With some now seeing Apple as a slow-growth giant that should be milked for cash, little wonder the firm is beefing up the ranks of those with experience in faster-growing foreign markets. But ultimately, its future rests on creating new gadgets that people will pay up for -- no matter where they live.
