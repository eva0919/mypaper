TAIPEI¡XHTC Corp. on Friday predicted sales would at least stay flat in the fourth quarter after three years of decline.
The Taiwanese smartphone maker expects revenue of 43 billion New Taiwan dollars to NT$47 billion (US$1.41 billion to US$1.55 billion) for the current quarter ending Dec. 31. The target range represents a growth of 2.7% to 12% from NT$41.86 billion in the third quarter, and as much as 9.6% higher than the NT$42.90 billion it fetched in the same period in 2013.
HTC also expects to remain profitable for the third straight quarter. In the three months ended Sept. 30, HTC reported a net profit of NT$640 million, compared with a net loss of NT$2.97 billion a year earlier.
We are forecasting a pretty material increase in handset shipment volume [for the fourth quarter],¡¨ Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang told investors during a conference call. Mr. Chang declined to disclose the company¡¦s shipment forecast.
¡§I hope the momentum will extend into the first quarter of next year,¡¨ Mr. Chang said.
But analysts say HTC still faces headwinds in a market dominated by Apple Inc. and fast-growing Chinese players.
A challenge HTC and most Android handset makers face in this quarter is the stronger-than-expected demand for the new iPhones. Apple recently launched two iPhones, one with a bigger 5? inch screen. Both offer one of the biggest revamps to the iPhone in two years and are well-timed for the year-end holiday season.
HTC, once the world¡¦s top smartphone maker by volume, dropped out of the top 10 largest handset vendors by shipments last year. Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. have been grabbing HTC¡¦s share in the high-end market, while low-cost Chinese makers have been squeezing the Taiwanese company in the mid- and low-end markets.
HTC is hoping to reverse years of shrinking sales by beefing up its midrange product lines and expanding into non-smartphone businesses.
The company has recently added a selfie-focused smartphone to its midprice Desire line. It has also unveiled the Nexus 9 tablet with Google Inc., a waterproof action camera and software for taking selfie photos.
Mr. Chang said HTC has plans to launch new smartphones over the next two quarters, but declined to give more details.
He also said the project with Google doesn¡¦t mean HTC is returning to contract manufacturing of phones and tablets for other brands.
¡§We are open to, and will also consider, co-branding opportunities with partners,¡¨ he added.
But the midtier market is getting crowded, which complicates HTC¡¦s reliance on that segment as a solution, analysts say.
Samsung said Thursday it would seek to compete head-on against low-priced Chinese rivals amid falling sales in China. Chinese brands like Xiaomi Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. are already dominating the that market.
¡§Apparently HTC is trying to stay away from the competition from Apple in the high-end segment. But the smartphone market, especially the mid- and low-end segments, is still very tough,¡¨ said KGI Securities analyst Richard Ko.
