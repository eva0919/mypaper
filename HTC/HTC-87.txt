STARBUCKS
Cafe Chain Credits Loyalty
Program With Sales Boost
Starbucks Corp.'s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose a better-than-expected 34% on sales that increased by a double-digit percentage but still fell just short of estimates.
The coffee company also said its board of directors boosted the dividend by 24% to 26 cents.
Starbucks has recorded stronger sales trends in the U.S. than most of its competitors. Same-store sales rose 8% in the U.S., driven by a 5% rise in transactions.
Starbucks Chief Financial Officer and Group President of Global Business Services Troy Alstead said in an interview that faster drive-through speed, new food and beverage offerings, and the chain's loyalty program drew new and repeat customers in the U.S.
Overall, the company reported a profit of $481.1 million, or 63 cents a share, up from $359 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 13% to $3.8 billion.

NOKIA
Handset Maker to Seek
Ban on HTC Devices
Nokia Corp. said it would seek financial compensation from HTC Corp. and a U.K. sales ban on the Taiwanese company's mobile devices, after a major court win in its continuing patent disputes with the company.
The U.K. High Court ruled Wednesday in favor of Nokia, finding that HTC products -- including the company's flagship HTC One smartphone and HTC Wildfire -- infringe a Nokia patent.
As a result the case, the Finnish company said it would seek an injunction against the "import and sale of infringing HTC products in the U.K. as well as financial compensation." It added that the amount of the compensation and the nature of a potential sales ban are matters for further discussion with the court.
Nokia has been aggressively pursuing its intellectual-property rights over the past few years. In 2011, Apple Inc. and Nokia agreed to settle a number of patent disputes between the two companies, with Apple agreeing to make a one-time payment to Nokia and to pay continuing royalties as part of a patent-license agreement.

WEIGHT WATCHERS
Dividends Suspended as
Mobile Apps Sap Growth
Weight Watchers International Inc. suspended its dividend and forecast another year of declining sales as the weight-loss company struggles to retain paying members in an era of free smartphone apps and gadgets that track calories.
The company's new Chief Executive James Chambers who took the job in August said the company's prognosis is worse than he thought.
"I see now that the situation, as a business and an organization, is more difficult than originally appeared," Mr. Chambers said on Wednesday. While he said the business can be fixed, "it will take time. There is no silver bullet."
With the dividend cut, Weight Watchers hopes to save $39 million a year to give the company enough wiggle room to restructure its business and build up cash to pay its debt down the road.
The move came as third-quarter sales declined 8.5% from a year earlier. Profit dropped 11% to $60.3 million, though the company slightly raised its earnings outlook for the year due to cost cuts.

BOEING
777X Will Be Designed
Outside Pacific Northwest
Boeing Co. will design its new 777X jetliner with engineers in Russia and five states -- a snub to technical staff in the Pacific Northwest that have been central to creating every major Boeing jetliner over the past 60 years.
Any role by staff at Boeing's facilities in the Puget Sound, Wash., area in designing or building the revamped twin-aisle jet hasn't been decided, the company said in a memo to engineers Wednesday.
The 777X will be designed by engineers in St. Louis; Philadelphia; North Charleston, S.C.; Huntsville, Ala.; and Long Beach, Calif. Boeing's design center in Moscow will assist in the jet's design.
"The announced structure will allow for an efficient use of resources and enable Boeing to resolve design issues effectively the first time," Mike Delaney, Boeing's commercial airplane vice president of engineering, and Scott Fancher, vice president of airplane development, wrote in the memo, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
A Boeing spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the memo.

SUNTECH POWER
Solar-Panel Maker
To Get Financial Lifeline
One of China's largest solar-panel makers is poised to receive a $150 million lifeline from a company controlled by its hometown government after defaulting on billions of dollars in debt earlier this year.
The investment, disclosed Wednesday, comes despite Beijing's effort to reduce government-intervention in China's solar sector, which has been plagued by overcapacity and falling prices for solar panels. Last year, China's State Council, or cabinet, said it would reduce government support and encourage mergers and consolidation.
Suntech Power Holdings Co. said Wednesday it received a letter of intent from Wuxi Guolian Development Group to invest at least $150 million toward the "comprehensive rehabilitation and restructuring" of the company. U.S.-listed Suntech said there would be "substantial dilution for existing shareholders" because of the investment, but gave no additional details.
