TAIPEI -- HTC Corp.'s marketing chief is on sabbatical and its head of engineering has switched positions, as leadership changes continue at the struggling Taiwanese smartphone maker.
Benjamin Ho, who joined the company as chief marketing officer in January 2013, has gone on a sabbatical leave for an undisclosed period, HTC said Tuesday. Mr. Ho confirmed he is on leave but declined to say whether he had resigned.
Fred Liu, president of engineering and operations, will be assigned to oversee manufacturing and sales services, said two HTC employees, citing an internal memo the company sent Tuesday. Mr. Liu's original duties will be split between Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang and Chief Engineering Officer David Chen, the people said. Mr. Liu couldn't be reached for comment.
HTC declined to say whether Mr. Liu and Mr. Ho have resigned.
These are the latest management changes at HTC, which was the top seller of Android smartphones in the U.S. three years ago but has since fallen out of the world's top 10 vendors. In an effort to reverse the slide, Chairwoman Cher Wang took over supervision of marketing from Chief Executive Peter Chou, who refocused on product development. Mr. Chang, the finance chief, received an expanded role, doubling as global head of sales.
