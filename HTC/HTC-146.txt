Microsoft Corp. agreed to a patent licensing deal with communications provider Motorola Solutions Inc., granting world-wide coverage under its patent portfolio for Motorola Solutions's devices running the Android and Chrome OS operating system.
"Microsoft prefers licensing to litigation, since licensing is a more effective way to share technology and accelerate the pace of innovation," said Nick Psyhogeos, an associate general counsel of intellectual properties licensing at Microsoft.
Motorola, which recently agreed to sell its scanner business to Zebra Technologies Corp. for $3.5 billion, provides services to government and public-safety customers, offering communications systems for services such as police and fire departments.
Since Microsoft launched its intellectual property licensing program in 2003, the company has entered into more than 1,100 licensing agreements. The program was developed to provide access to Microsoft's research and development investments and patent and intellectual-property portfolio.
Microsoft's specific patent licensing program for Android device-makers has resulted in signed license agreements with companies including Samsung, ZTE, LG, HTC, Acer and Barnes & Noble.
