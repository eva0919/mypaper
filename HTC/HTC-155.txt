<Date:>9 April 2014

Most Asian stock markets rose Tuesday, with China leading the region higher, while Japan was weighed down by a stronger yen and continued tech-stock weakness.
Technology companies across the region continued to face pressure from a selloff in the sector that started in the U.S. last week, as investors started to ditch high-tech and biotech stocks that have helped lead the market higher in recent weeks.
Asia's big technology names faced another session of selling. In Japan, Sony lost 1.4% and Sharp dropped 3.7%.
Samsung Electronics fell 0.2% in Seoul after it forecast an operating-profit decline for the second consecutive quarter. The company is just days away from rolling out its new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S5.
In Taiwan, phone maker HTC lost 2.5% after the company announced late Monday that it swung to a net loss in the first quarter amid increasing competition from smartphone rivals.
There were some signs of stability, as Tencent Holdings bounced back 1.6% in Hong Kong after the index heavyweight fell 11% over the previous four sessions.
Chinese stocks led the region higher, with mainland China resuming trade after a public holiday on Monday. Chinese companies in both Hong Kong and Shanghai were still buoyed by Beijing's recently announced stimulus measures, with the Shanghai Composite up 1.9% at 2098.28 and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index up 1.6% at 10321.82. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 1% to 22596.97.
Weak manufacturing numbers out of China have heightened concerns that Beijing might have to step in more and introduce additional supportive measures. The next economic data point will be March export numbers on Thursday, with economists expecting a 4.2% increase from a year earlier.
In Japan, the Nikkei was down 1.4% at 14606.88, unaffected by the Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat on monetary policy, as falling technology stocks and a stronger yen had a stronger impact on the market. The dollar was at 102.74 yen in late Asia, compared with 103.09 yen late Monday in New York.
Also in Japan, Takeda Pharmaceutical closed down 5.2% after a U.S. jury imposed a $6 billion charge on the company in a case involving allegations that it hid the cancer risks of its Actos diabetes drug.
Elsewhere, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell less than 0.1% to 5410.60, and South Korea's Kospi added 0.2% to 1993.03. India's markets were closed for a public holiday.
