Lenovo figures it can prosper by picking up hardware businesses that U.S. tech firms toss aside. But its acquisition of Motorola's handset business from Google is a step too far.
Lenovo just bought IBM's low-end server business. This makes sense. Reviving that business requires cutting costs and ramping up sales in China, aided by the fact that Chinese state-owned firms are shunning U.S.-made hardware now.
Motorola will be harder to turn around. Investors sensed it, pushing Lenovo's stock down 8% in Hong Kong. Chairman Yang Yuanqing calls the deal a "shortcut" into the U.S. market, and hopes Lenovo can double its handset sales to 100 million units in a year.
Shortcuts in business rarely turn out well. Lenovo is buying a well received, stylish product lineup. But as past champions BlackBerry and HTC know, smartphone success is fleeting and needs constant innovation. To succeed, Lenovo will have to invest a lot in research and development, design, marketing and carrier relationships.
None of those are Lenovo's strong points. Since buying the ThinkPad brand from IBM, it has been known for functional, not sleek, laptops. Lenovo was the world's fifth-largest smartphone seller last year according to IDC. But that is mainly due to China and other emerging markets, where it specializes in lower-end devices.
Despite paying much less for Motorola than what Google paid, Lenovo isn't getting a bargain. Sanford C. Bernstein says Lenovo is paying 0.6 times sales for an asset that had deep losses the last two years. In contrast, IBM's server unit went for 0.5 times and was close to breaking even.
Picking up IBM's personal-computer business was a coup, and its follow-up for the server business looks clever. But Lenovo's attempt to dive into U.S. smartphones smacks of hubris.
