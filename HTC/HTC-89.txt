TAIPEI -- In a strategy shift, HTC Corp. is considering outsourcing smartphone production to other companies as it looks for ways to cut costs and return to profitability.
The Taiwanese smartphone maker is in talks with several major contract manufacturers, including BlackBerry supplier Wistron Corp. and a unit of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., about the possibility of outsourcing some production, people familiar with the matter said. HTC last month swung to its first net loss since its initial public offering of stock in 2002.
The company currently produces all of its smartphones in-house at factories in Taiwan and China.
HTC's third-quarter sales fell 33% from a year earlier, leaving some factory capacity idle in Taiwan and Shanghai. The company's cash position is also deteriorating. HTC had 48.1 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$1.63 billion) in cash in the second quarter, down from NT$55.5 billion a year earlier.
One of the people familiar with the matter said HTC has also quietly asked some companies, including FIH Mobile Ltd., if they would be interested in buying one of HTC's factories.
HTC Chief Marketing Officer Ben Ho said in an interview that the company has consolidated some of its production lines in Taoyuan, Taiwan, into a single building for cost reasons. But he said HTC had no plans to sell its factories.
"We are looking at all ways to optimize cost without sacrificing quality," he said.
