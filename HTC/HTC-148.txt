HTC Corp. is hoping to nab a bit of that Samsung shine, as it has hired the South Korean company's former U.S. marketing chief as a consultant.
An spokeswoman for HTC confirmed Friday that Paul Golden, who helped create Samsung Electronics Co.'s successful Galaxy brand, is now a consultant for Chairwoman Cher Wang. The confirmation followed a Bloomberg report on Mr. Golden's hiring.
The struggling Taiwanese smartphone maker has long admitted that marketing was its weak spot. Within the past few years, HTC has shuffled through three CMOs, and in recent months Ms. Wang has taken an active role in overseeing the company's marketing plans.
HTC's 2012 and 2013 marketing campaigns were all high concept¡Xone involved sky divers; the other, Robert Downey Jr. giving branding advice to the company¡Xbut they failed to stem the company's slide in sales.
Golden was Samsung's U.S. CMO from 2008 to 2012. He wrote on his LinkedIn page that he created and launched Samsung's Galaxy brand, which helped propel the company's global smartphone market share to 21% from 4.5% during his tenure.
As for HTC, even a fraction of that market-share gain would be a success. The company's global smartphone market share has slid to less than 2%, according to Barclays analyst Dale Gai.
