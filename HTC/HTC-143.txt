TAIPEI¡XHTC Corp.'s design chief will step down, as the Taiwanese smartphone maker's market share shrinks and its reorganization continues.
Scott Croyle was the key individual behind the company's latest flagship smartphone, the HTC One (M8), which has garnered favorable reviews for its sleek design since it was unveiled earlier this year. Mr. Croyle will be focusing on "special projects" and "next-generation developments," HTC said in a statement Saturday.
A few years ago, HTC was the top seller of Android-powered smartphones. But then it ran into marketing and operational problems. It dropped out of the world's top 10 smartphone makers by volume last year, while competitors Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.¡Xas well as lower-cost Chinese rivals such as Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co.¡Xcontinued to gain ground.
HTC Chairwoman Cher Wang has taken a more active role in managing the company in an effort to reverse its slide. Chief Executive Peter Chou, who has an engineering background, has ceded some of his managerial duties and focused on product development.
To beef up its marketing efforts, the Taoyuan-based company also recently hired Samsung's former U.S. marketing chief, who helped create the successful Galaxy brand, as a consultant.
Mr. Croyle joined HTC in 2008 after One & Co., a San Francisco-based boutique design house he co-founded, was acquired by the Taiwanese company. He wasn't immediately available for comment.
Also on Saturday, HTC said Drew Bamford, responsible for the development of HTC's Sense software, will take on an additional role of leading the company's software development team. Mr. Bamford wasn't immediately available for comment.
