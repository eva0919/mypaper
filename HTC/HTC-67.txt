The International CES trade show is no longer the prime launching ground for mobile phones. But an early read from this week's conference points to one literally big trend: Smartphone makers are pushing screen sizes even larger.
But big sales of such devices might not follow suit.
Larger screens are in demand, but remain a small part of the smartphone market. Kantar Worldpanel ComTech estimates that phones with screens of five inches and larger accounted for about 15.2% of U.S. smartphone sales during October and November. And that period saw the launch of Samsung's Galaxy Note 3, which sports a 5.7-inch screen.
Samsung has championed so-called phablets with the Galaxy Note family. It said in December that it shipped 10 million units of the Note 3 in its initial two months. Yet its profit warning this week was chalked up in part to slowing smartphone sales. Mark Newman of Sanford C. Bernstein reckons Samsung "aggressively cleared channel inventory" during the fourth quarter.
Still, the phablet segment's growth has attracted the interest of rivals. Nokia, Sony, LG Electronics, HTC and even BlackBerry launched smartphones with screens five inches and larger in late 2013, and Google entered this segment with its own Nexus 5. At CES this week, Huawei, a Chinese maker of networking gear, unveiled the 6.1-inch Ascend Mate 2. Personal-computer maker Asus unveiled a new line of smartphones that includes the Padfone -- a 4.3-inch smartphone that docks with a 10.1-inch tablet -- and three Zenfone models with screen sizes of four, five and six inches.
And more may be coming. Handset makers have taken to using the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona as a launchpad for new devices. Samsung, LG and Sony already are rumored to have more smartphones in the queue to announce at the event, which gets under way on Feb. 24.
One big question: What Apple will do? Most analysts expect it to put out a larger-screen iPhone this year, having sat out of this segment to date. Conventional wisdom says doing so has cost Apple sales, though Kantar's data indicate that sales in the four-inch category still accounted for 47.3% of total smartphone sales in October and November.
If Apple launches an iPhab, it will be a behemoth weighing into an already crowded market. The problem with the next big thing is that it makes a large target for your rivals.
