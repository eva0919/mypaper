TAIPEI -- It's crunchtime for HTC Corp.
After posting a drop in revenue and its first-ever quarterly net loss, the once-highflying Taiwanese smartphone maker is fighting to prove to investors it doesn't need to consider a sale as Nokia Corp. or BlackBerry Ltd. did.
HTC on Tuesday warned that revenue will decline further in the fourth quarter, although it said cost cutting and the sale of assets should help the company return to a small profit.
The news came as HTC Chairwoman Cher Wang has taken a more active role in managing the company in an effort to reverse its slide. HTC was the leading smartphone maker in the U.S. just two years ago. But its stock has plunged nearly 90% since its April 2011 peak, as a weak brand and production problems put the company behind Samsung Electronics Co. and emerging Chinese low-cost rivals. HTC this year fell out of the top 10 for global smartphone market share, according to research firm Gartner.
Two weeks ago, Chief Executive Peter Chou gathered employees on the 17th-floor auditorium of HTC's glittering white headquarters south of Taipei to say he would cede some managerial control. Mr. Chou, whose background is in engineering, would focus on product development while handing off duties such as marketing and sales to Ms. Wang.
The management shift reflects how efforts have been unsuccessful over the past year to narrow a gap with Samsung and Apple Inc. HTC said it is working to lower costs and is considering outsourcing some smartphone production.
"This is a very quickly changing sector," Chief Financial Officer Chang Chia-Lin said on a conference call Tuesday. "We are changing our mind internally, as well. We're open to different ideas or possibilities."
HTC's decline has drawn speculation over whether it will follow the path of former mobile titans Nokia and BlackBerry. Finland's Nokia, which ruled the world's mobile market for more than a decade, is selling its handset business to Microsoft Corp. And Canada's BlackBerry, once a symbol of corporate power, said Monday its chief executive would step down and the company had abandoned a plan to sell itself.
Ms. Wang, the daughter of a Taiwanese petrochemical tycoon and HTC's largest shareholder, has been adamant about not selling the company. She and her husband together directly own about 6% of HTC.
While analysts have raised the possibility that HTC could tie up with a Chinese company, such as Lenovo Group Ltd., they have said it is unlikely that such a deal would go through without Ms. Wang's support. A cross-strait deal also would be unlikely for political reasons. Even much-smaller investments by Chinese companies in Taiwan have received close regulatory scrutiny by Taipei in light of Beijing's stated intentions to reunify Taiwan with the mainland.
"Cher Wang will not sell," said Barclays technology analyst Dale Gai. "But if HTC continues to burn cash, it will eventually need to find a strategic investor."
HTC said the company isn't interested in selling the business and declined to comment on rumors. Lenovo declined to comment.
A prominent new investor has emerged recently, however. Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai has accumulated a 2% stake in the past two months. Mr. Chang said Tuesday that HTC's management wasn't aware in advance that Mr. Lai was buying the shares. Mr. Lai wasn't available for comment.
HTC primarily uses Google Inc.'s Android operating system, which makes the Taiwanese company's phones more mainstream than those from Nokia and BlackBerry. But that also makes it harder for HTC to set itself apart from other Android-smartphone makers, such as Samsung and China's Xiaomi Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co.
There are other differences between HTC and the other struggling device makers as well. Nokia and BlackBerry both stumbled when they failed to move quickly into touch-screen smartphones. HTC was an early mover in the technology. It also was the first company to make an Android smartphone and has kept pace with industry trends. The HTC One smartphone, unveiled in February, has been lauded by reviewers as one of the top phones on the market.
HTC's problems instead have stemmed from a lack of discipline that has led to repeated production mistakes as well as weak branding and sales, current and former executives said.
Originally a contract manufacturer, HTC developed strong technical capabilities. But its long-term planning and operations remained disorganized once HTC started marketing its own brand in 2006 and began growing rapidly, several former executives said. The release of the flagship HTC One lost crucial sales in the weeks before the release of rival products because of delays in obtaining camera components. The company's main model last year, the HTC One X, had hardware flaws that were the result of rushed development, people familiar with the matter said.
Several high-level executives have left over the past year, including the heads of products, operations and design. Morale fell among engineers after last year was the first in memory that they didn't receive a year-end cash bonus, current and former employees said. HTC this year also lowered the portion of stock bonuses that vest immediately, to 30% from 40%, current and former employees said.
"This is a young company and brand," HTC said Tuesday. "We've seen incredible gains over the short time we've existed and, like many young brands, we've also faced some challenges." Ms. Wang and Mr. Chou weren't available for interviews.
After the close of trading Tuesday, HTC forecast that fourth-quarter revenue would fall to between 40 billion New Taiwan dollars and NT$45 billion, or roughly US$1.4 billion to US$1.5 billion, from NT$60 billion a year earlier. The company forecast per-share earnings at 10 New Taiwan cents to NT$1.70, compared with NT$1.21 a year earlier. HTC didn't explain why the forecast range was so wide.
The company swung to a third-quarter net loss of NT$2.97 billion from a net profit of NT$3.9 billion. Revenue dropped to NT$47 billion from NT$70.2 billion a year earlier.
For now, HTC plans to push heavily into China, where Ms. Wang aims to capture 20% of the market for high-end smartphones by next year.
But that will be a tall order. Across all smartphone price bands, HTC ranks 13th in China with 1.7% of the market, according to Gartner.
The company also is racing to produce a wearable device and is looking at ways to improve its customer service, said Chief Marketing Officer Ben Ho.
Meanwhile, HTC's leadership is asking for patience. "Change takes time," Mr. Ho said, "especially if you're trying to change fundamentals."
Investors are getting restless. Its stock fell 7% Tuesday in Taiwan.
