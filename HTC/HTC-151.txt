Wi-Lan Inc. said a U.S. federal judge determined that an October jury verdict improperly invalidated some of the Canada-based patent-licensing company's claims in a dispute with Apple Inc.
Wi-Lan said in a statement Wednesday that the court was unable to find substantial supporting evidence for the jury's finding and as such the invalidity verdict can't stand. However, the judge denied other aspects of Wi-Lan's challenges to the verdict.
Wi-Lan had sued Apple, Alcatel-Lucent, Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., HTC Corp., Novatel Wireless Inc. and Sierra Wireless Inc. in September 2011, claiming patent infringement on certain technologies.
A jury ruled in favor of Apple in October. Wi-Lan previously settled with the other six defendants in the case.
An Apple spokesman couldn't immediately be reached to comment.
Wi-Lan President and Chief Executive Jim Skippen said the company "believed all along that the claims in our 802 patent were valid, and this decision just reaffirms that belief."
"We also believe that the judge's ruling will be of significant benefit to Wi-Lan with respect to any future appeals we may make to the U.S. federal courts concerning our ongoing intellectual property disputes with Apple," he added.
