Most Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday, with China leading the region higher, while Japan was weighed by a stronger yen and continued tech-stock weakness.
Technology companies across the region continued to face pressure from a selloff in the sector that started in the U.S. last week, as investors started to ditch high-tech and biotech stocks that have helped lead the market higher in recent weeks. On Monday, the S&P 500 lost 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 1.2%.
Asia's big technology names faced another session of selling. In Japan, Sony Corp. lost 1.4% and Sharp Corp. dropped 3.7%.
Samsung Electronics fell 0.2% in Seoul after it forecast an operating-profit decline for the second consecutive quarter. The company is just days away from rolling out its new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S5.
In Taiwan, where the Taiex was up 0.1% at 8888.25, phone maker HTC Corp. lost 2.5% after the company announced late Monday that it swung to a net loss in the first quarter amid increasing competition from smartphone rivals.
There were some signs of stability, as Tencent Holdings bounced back 1.6% in Hong Kong after the index heavyweight fell 11% over the previous four sessions.
Broadly across the region, performance was mixed. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell less than 0.1% to 5410.60, South Korea's Kospi added 0.2% to 1993.03, and the Philippines' PSE lost 0.4% to 6587.49.
Chinese stocks led the region higher, with mainland China resuming trade after a public holiday on Monday. Chinese companies in both Hong Kong and Shanghai were still buoyed by Beijing's recently announced stimulus measures, with the Shanghai Composite up 1.9% at 2098.28 and the Hang SengChina Enterprises Index 1.6% higher at 10321.82. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 1% to 22596.97
Weak manufacturing numbers out of China have heightened concerns that Beijing might have to step in more and introduce more supportive measures. The next economic data point will be March export numbers on Thursday, with economists expecting a 4.2% increase from a year earlier.
In Japan, the Nikkei was down 1.4% at 14606.88, unaffected by the Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat on monetary policy, as falling technology stocks and a stronger yen had a stronger impact on the market.
The yen strengthened against the dollar, with the U.S. dollar falling back below the ?103 mark. The yen was last at ?102.74 to the dollar compared with ?103.09 late Monday in New York.
Also in Japan, shares in Takeda Pharmaceutical closed down 5.2% after a U.S. jury imposed a $6 billion charge on the company in a case involving allegations that it hid the cancer risks of its Actos diabetes drug.
