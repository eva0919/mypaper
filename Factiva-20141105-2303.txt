Short-Changing Taiwan's Market; Taipei regulators hurt themselves by trying to squelch bad news.

Taiwan wants to become an international financial center, but its regulators keep undermining that ambition. The latest example is a threatened prosecution of California-based short-seller Glaucus Research Group.

In April Glaucus released a report about suspicious accounting at Asia Plastic Recycling, a Taipei-listed producer of foam rubber based in China's Fujian province. Citing official land, tax and other public records, Glaucus argued that Asia Plastic Recycling inflated its earnings by as much as 10 times. Within days the stock dropped some 30%.

That prompted the Taiwan Stock Exchange to launch an investigation into the alleged fraud. In a mere three days, it concluded that Asia Plastic Recycling had been "truthful" in its financial statements. The real wrongdoer, according to Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman William Tseng, was Glaucus, which had "maliciously spread rumors." Asia Plastic Recycling denied Glaucus's claims and sued for damages.

In May the Financial Supervisory Commission asked prosecutors to indict Glaucus on charges of market manipulation that could bar the firm from doing business in Taiwan and carry jail sentences of up to 10 years. Regulators have also organized a class-action suit against Glaucus by some 2,000 allegedly injured Taiwanese shareholders.

The speed and severity of Taipei's response don't bode well for Taiwanese markets. Glaucus notes that in past cases involving firms listed in the United States or Hong Kong, local regulators have backed up their suspicions of fraud after spending months or years examining independent records from tax authorities, banks, customers and suppliers.

Glaucus may or may not have the goods this time, but Taipei's three-day inquiry isn't reassuring anybody. The share price of Asia Plastic Recycling has continued to fall since April.

Taipei's campaign to squelch bad news extends beyond Glaucus. When details of a negative Barclays report concerning Taiwan's electronics industry leaked last month, Mr. Tseng, the financial regulatory chief, blasted such disclosures as "very inappropriate." Local media report that his agency may this month criminalize future leaks from foreign brokerage houses.

Prosecutors may decide not to indict Glaucus¡Xas they did in a similar case two years ago, when cellphone maker HTC Corp. asked for charges against a critical Citigroup analyst. The Financial Supervisory Commission had never sought such an indictment until Glaucus came along backing its short sale with a public case, an apparent first for a Taiwan-listed stock.

Such "activist shorts" are common elsewhere and have been helpful in rooting out fraudsters operating in China. The lifeblood of any market is the free flow of information, including critical views that keep managers accountable. If Taiwan wants to foster healthy capital markets, its regulators are going about it the wrong way.

LG Electronics Dials Up a Turnaround on Smartphone Sales; Net Profit Rises Sharply, Helped by Launch of G3

SEOUL¡XLG Electronics Inc. said its net profit rose sharply in the second quarter as its mobile business staged a turnaround on higher smartphone sales.

The South Korean consumer-electronics giant launched a new flagship smartphone, the LG G3, in May, allowing it to expand its range of phones during a seasonally weak quarter and ending three straight quarters of operating losses at the mobile unit.

The results are the latest indication that lesser-known smartphone brands such as LG are benefiting from slowing hardware innovation from larger rivals. Earlier this month, HTC Corp. reported an 80% year-over-year increase in its profit for the quarter ended June 30, with the Taiwanese smartphone maker attributing the growth to strong sales of its flagship and midrange phones as well as cost-cutting. Analysts say such increases have come, in part, at the expense of weaker-than-expected smartphone shipments from Samsung Electronics Co., the world's biggest smartphone maker.

LG said Thursday its net profit for the three months ended June 30 more than doubled to 411.8 billion won ($402 million) from 155.5 billion won a year ago.

It sold 14.5 million smartphones during the quarter, up 19.8% from 12.1 million units a year earlier. This led to a 40% year-over-year increase in operating profits for the mobile division to 85.9 billion won, and a turnaround from losses for three straight quarters, the company said.

Analysts estimated LG to have shipped more than 900,000 units of its latest flagship G3 smartphone in the second quarter, which beat initial market expectations of about 500,000 units. LG, which had launched previous flagship smartphone models in the second half, advanced the timing of the launch this year by several months in a bid to combat competition from rivals.

Still, the third quarter will be a challenge for South Korea's second-largest smartphone vendor, as both Apple Inc. and Samsung are planning new product launches. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is widely expected to launch two new iPhone models sporting larger screens, while Samsung traditionally introduces its popular smartphone hybrid model, the Galaxy Note, in the fall.

LG will have to spend a larger amount on marketing this quarter, which will pressure the company's margins, analysts said. LG's mobile-division profit margin rose to 2.4% in the second quarter from 2% a year earlier.

LG's second-quarter operating profit rose 26.5% to 606.2 billion won, while revenue rose to 15.37 trillion won from 15.23 trillion won. TVs accounted for 33% of the company's total revenue, while mobile phones accounted for 24%. The company is betting heavily on high-end TV models with organic light-emitting diode screens to drive demand in the coming quarters.

Sony's Walkman Makes a Comeback

TOKYO -- Thirty five years after its debut, Sony Corp.'s Walkman is enjoying a little comeback.

But while the original cassette player of 1979 heralded the age of mass-market, portable music, the new $700 Walkman is aimed at premium buyers, as technological advances help more audio-on-the go users head upscale.

The ZX1, as Sony's gadget is called, is in many ways the antithesis of Apple Inc.'s slender iPod, and the Walkman's own svelte predecessors. It has a heavy, bulky body that houses 128 gigabytes of storage for ultra-high-quality music files. Sony says each ZX1 is manually carved from a block of expensive aluminum, which helps reduce noise.

"The message for our designers and engineers was: please create a good product without worrying about the cost," said Kenji Nakada, Sony's sound product planner.

Unlike many earlier Sony attempts at high-end consumer electronics, the ZX1 is selling well -- at least in Japan. The new Walkman quickly sold out after hitting Japanese stores in December. Since February, the product has made its debut in Europe and other parts of Asia, although its launch date in the U.S. hasn't been set.

Despite the success, the ZX1 remains a niche product: Sony declined to give sales figures but analysts estimate only several thousand units have been sold so far in Japan.

And nobody expects the new Walkman -- however successful -- to go far in turning around Sony's chronic losses. The company said it lost $1.3 billion in the fiscal year ended March, and expects to stay in the red through March 2015. Televisions and games remain Sony's mainstay products in consumer electronics.

Still, the ZX1's popularity does highlight what industry watchers say is a shift among some portable-audio buyers, as advances in Internet speed and data storage allow consumers, who long opted for convenience over sound quality, to have both. Older-generation digital-audio players managed to store tens of thousands of songs in slim devices by compressing the audio files, a process that sacrificed sound quality.

"An entire generation missed the visceral emotion of listening to uncompressed audio," said Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, during an electronics show in January.

Now, faster and bigger storage memory chips as well as speedier Internet connections allow gadgets like the Walkman ZX1 to play, store and transfer heavier music files that the industry has dubbed "high-resolution audio" without losing too much of the sound data from original recordings. Longer battery life also allows the Walkman to play heavy audio files and last around 16 hours, although that is still about one-fifth of the hours possible for other portable players playing compressed files, according to Mr. Nakada.

Sony claims the format provides better sound quality than CDs, from deep bass tones to high-pitched sounds, including the moment when the singer takes a breath. High-resolution audio files contain more than three times as much audio data than CDs.

Sony has rolled out more than 25 types of high-resolution audio devices since September, including a cheaper Walkman model; it says the products made up more than 20% of all audio sales for the October through March period.

Other firms are also experimenting in the area. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co., LG Electronics Inc. and Taiwan's HTC Corp. are all coming out with smartphones that claim to support high-resolution audio files.

In the U.S., sales of premium headphones have doubled in the past three years, according to research firm NPD Group. Japanese research firm Fuji Chimera Research Institute Inc. projects that high-resolution audio devices will account for about 20% of sales in the global audio market by 2020 in terms of value from less than around 5% now.

"People are becoming more quality conscious with high-definition television and this is the same parallel in the audio world," said David Chesky, the founder of HDtracks, a U.S. digital-music store that offers high-resolution audio files. The firm has more than doubled its revenue each year since its launch in 2008.

Tento Koyama, a 19-year-old university student, is one consumer who is willing to pay extra for sound quality. In mid-May, Mr. Koyama lined up for one hour to take part in a headphone festival event in Tokyo where Sony's ZX1 Walkman was displayed.

"I think this one is the best Walkman in its history," Mr. Koyama said, after listening to the ZX1 at a crowded Sony booth. "I don't mind the price."

Still, analysts say hurdles remain high for mass adoption since differences in sound quality are harder to detect than differences in TV picture quality.

"To get it to the mainstream, it's an effort to actually get people to listen to the difference," said Benjamin Arnold, an industry analyst at NPD Group.

And just as with TVs and smartphones, Sony already faces a growing challenge from rival audio device makers.

After trying out the ZX1 Walkman for about 40 minutes at a consumer-electronics store in Tokyo, Mr. Tamaki, a 34-year-old employee at a publishing firm who only gave his last name, said he's leaning toward buying a high-quality portable audio player by Iriver Ltd., a South Korean firm founded by former Samsung officials. That product cost twice as much as Sony's ZX1.

"This one is better than Sony's," he concluded.

ANALYSIS-Smartphone suit against Google plays into rivals' hands

SAN FRANCISCO, July 18 (Reuters) - A U.S. consumer lawsuit accusing Google of monopolizing prime real estate on Android smartphones will help mobile rivals like Microsoft make their antitrust case with European regulators should damaging secrets emerge in court.

The suit, filed in California federal court in May by two smartphone consumers, said Google requires handset manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to restrict competing apps like Microsoft's Bing search on Android phones, partly by making Google's own apps the default.

Google argued last week the proposed class action should be dismissed because consumers still are free to use the other apps. The plaintiffs counter that most consumers either don't know how to switch default settings, or will not go to the trouble.

If a judge lets the lawsuit proceed, plaintiffs' attorneys would be allowed to delve into internal Google emails and contracts with smartphone companies, and could interview Google executives under oath, said Steve Berman, who represents the consumers.

"I'm confident we will get into juicy stuff, and I think that will up the pressure on Google as some of the material we discover becomes public," he said.

Google declined to comment. A hearing on Google's bid to dismiss the case is scheduled for October.

Any damaging evidence from the class action would play into the hands of Google's rivals. Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans said the company "is not a party" to the consumer lawsuit, but last year a group of companies - including Microsoft, Oracle, Nokia, Expedia and TripAdvisor - filed a complaint with European antitrust regulators over some of the same issues in the U.S. lawsuit.

Google apps "are widely used on Android by requiring default placement and other mechanisms for disadvantaging competing apps," the companies said in a summary of their complaint.

Google last year said it was working cooperatively with European regulators, who have yet to decide whether to formally investigate.

MICROSOFT TIES

Berman has a long history of taking on large U.S. companies. He reached a settlement for consumers suing Apple over its e-book sales practices that could reach $450 million, and settled for $1.6 billion a lawsuit on behalf of Toyota car owners with unintended acceleration claims.

But the Seattle-based plaintiffs' lawyer also has represented one of Google's main rivals. Berman defended Microsoft when it faced its own antitrust investigations over Windows. Berman said he has had "conversations with Microsoft over the years about Google's conduct," but not about this lawsuit.

No stranger to antitrust inquiries, Google was scrutinized by U.S. and European regulators over allegations that it improperly manipulated search results to rank its own services higher than competitors.

U.S. authorities ultimately closed their investigation without filing a lawsuit, and Europe's competition commissioner negotiated a settlement earlier this year which is awaiting approval by the broader European Commission.

PRIME REAL ESTATE

The main issue for U.S. courts will be whether Android and mobile services like search are "technically separate, or tied in ways that impedes competition for consumers," said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

Cusumano has extensively researched Microsoft, which unsuccessfully sued the professor in the 1990s for access to his notes. This year Microsoft has sought to hire him to write an expert opinion in an unrelated proceeding.

The U.S. consumer lawsuit is based largely on contracts between Google and Android manufacturers Samsung and HTC that became public during Oracle's separate 2012 trial against Google.

If Samsung or HTC wishes to use Google apps on its phones, the consumer lawsuit said, they must preload a suite of services - including YouTube and Maps - on "prime screen real estate" on the phones, and set Google search as the default.

It also argues that Google's deal with Apple to be the default search on iPhones and iPads locks out competitors across the mobile universe. Apple does not have its own search engine, has lower market share worldwide than Android and is not a defendant in the case.

Google's deals with handset makers do not prevent rival search engines "from reaching consumers through the various distribution channels available to them," Google wrote in its motion to dismiss the U.S. lawsuit.

Cusumano said the U.S. class action could hurt Google if a judge finds that it improperly pushes its mapping and location services, which is embedded across the Android system.

It's "kind of a Pandora's Box to look inside what Google does, and the relationship it has with all these smartphone and handset manufacturers," he said. (Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Howard Goller)

HTC

Phone Maker Continues

Shuffling Top Ranks

HTC Corp.'s marketing chief is on sabbatical and its head of engineering has switched positions, as leadership changes continue at the struggling Taiwanese smartphone maker.

Benjamin Ho, who joined the company as chief marketing officer in January 2013, has gone on a sabbatical leave for an undisclosed period, HTC said Tuesday. Mr. Ho confirmed he is on leave but declined to give further details or say whether he had resigned.

Fred Liu, the longtime president of engineering and operations, will be assigned to oversee manufacturing and sales services, said two HTC employees, citing an internal memo the company sent Tuesday. Mr. Liu's original duties will be split between Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang and Chief Engineering Officer David Chen, the people said. Mr. Liu couldn't be reached for comment.

HTC declined to say whether Mr. Liu and Mr. Ho have resigned. It added that the company continues to invest in talent and recruitment.

J.B. HUNT

Trucking Firm's Earnings

Rise on Revenue Boost

J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. said its second-quarter earnings rose 6.5% on revenue growth across most of its business segments.

The trucking sector was expected to rebound in the current quarter after getting hit by severe winter weather this year that led to rail-service disruptions and added costs during the first quarter.

During the latest quarter, revenue at J.B Hunt's intermodal segment, which involves the movement of freight containers by several modes of transportation, continued to improve, up 8.9% to $931 million on load growth of 8% and revenue-per-loads increase of 1%.

"The slowdown in train velocity and the difficult driver recruiting environment has challenged our growth" in the intermodal segment," Chief Executive John N. Roberts III said. However, the company was still able to maintain profitability levels, he added.

Worsening driver supply conditions also are expected to remain a challenge for the company's dedicated contract services segment and its trucking segment, Mr. Roberts said. Meanwhile, planned improvement in the trucking business is ahead of schedule.

J.B. Hunt reported a profit of $93.4 million, or 79 cents a share, up from $87.7 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 12% to $1.55 billion.

BOART LONGYEAR

Drill Rig Supplier Enters

Restructuring Talks

Boart Longyear Ltd., the world's largest supplier of drill rigs to the mining sector, has begun talks with restructuring specialists to avoid bankruptcy as resources companies' demand for equipment plummets, three people familiar with the matter said.

Utah-based Boart has been seeking to sell assets or raise capital since February, when it appointed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to carry out a strategic review as a response to widening losses and high debts.

Now, Boart has started to work with a different set of advisers -- the Australian restructuring group at law firm Ashurst LLP, and insolvency practitioners KordaMentha -- that specialize in radical measures to save companies from financial collapse, the people said.

Boart's share price has crashed from a high of 270 Australian dollars (US$254) in 2007 to 13.5 Australian cents Tuesday after a sharp downturn in global mining investment. At the end of last year, only three out of every 10 drilling rigs owned by Boart were in use, as many resources companies opted to conserve cash rather than explore for new deposits of commodities such as iron ore.

HERSHEY

Chocolatier Raises Prices

On Higher Commodity Costs

Hershey Co. said Tuesday it would increase prices, citing higher commodity, utility and transportation costs.

The company announced an increase in wholesale prices by a weighted average of about 8% across the majority of its U.S., Puerto Rico and export portfolio.

Hershey also said it expects 2014 sales growth around the low end of its 5% to 7% target, and predicts adjusted earnings growth for the year will be near the low end of its 9% to 11% target.

The price increase "will help offset part of the significant increases in Hershey's input costs, including raw materials, packaging, fuel, utilities and transportation, which the company expects to incur in the future," it said.

HTC declined to say whether Mr. Liu and Mr. Ho have resigned.

These are the latest management changes at HTC, which was the top seller of Android smartphones in the U.S. three years ago but has since fallen out of the world's top 10 vendors. In an effort to reverse the slide, Chairwoman Cher Wang took over supervision of marketing from Chief Executive Peter Chou, who refocused on product development. Mr. Chang, the finance chief, received an expanded role, doubling as global head of sales.

HTC Makes Further Leadership Changes Amid Falling Sales; Taiwanese Smartphone Maker's Marketing Head Takes Sabbatical; Engineering Chief Is Reassigned

TAIPEI¡XHTC Corp.'s marketing chief is on sabbatical and the engineering chief has left his position, as changes continue among the top leadership of the struggling Taiwanese smartphone maker.

Benjamin Ho, who joined the company as chief marketing officer in January 2013, has gone on a sabbatical leave for an undisclosed period, HTC said Tuesday. Mr. Ho confirmed he is on leave but declined to give further details or say whether he has resigned.

Fred Liu, the longtime president of engineering and operations, will be assigned to oversee manufacturing and sales services, said two HTC employees, citing an internal memo the company sent Tuesday. Mr. Liu's original duties will be split between Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang and Chief Engineering Officer David Chen, the people said.

Mr. Liu couldn't be reached for comment.

HTC declined to say whether Mr. Liu and Mr. Ho have resigned. It added that the company continues to invest in talent and recruitment.

These are the latest management changes at HTC, which was the top seller of Android smartphones in the U.S. three years ago but has since fallen out of the world's top 10 vendors. In an effort to reverse the slide, Chairwoman Cher Wang took over supervision of marketing and some other areas from Chief Executive Peter Chou, who refocused on product development. Mr. Chang, the finance chief, received an expanded role, doubling as global head of sales.

Cost-cutting and the launch of new phones helped HTC snap three straight quarters of operating losses in the second quarter. But revenue still fell from a year earlier, as the company lost ground to Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea and low-cost Chinese competitors.

Marketing has long been a sore point for HTC, whose phones have garnered praise from reviewers but failed to make brisk sales. Mr. Ho is the third marketing chief to leave the post in less than two years. He has been under pressure from Ms. Wang, who has said publicly that marketing was a weak spot, and who recruited Samsung's former U.S. marketing head as a consultant this year.

Apart from launching a new high-end flagship smartphone, the HTC One (M8), the company has also introduced smartphones priced as low as US$145 this quarter to grab a bigger share in emerging markets. In a first for the company, HTC started outsourcing production of some of its smartphones this quarter in a bid to contain costs.

Shares in HTC have lost 90% from their peak in 2011.

The company posted an 80% year-to-year rise in net profit for the second quarter, but said revenue fell 8%.

UPDATE 1-Taiwan June exports rise on U.S. demand, new smartphones

* June exports +1.2 pct y/y vs +1.7 pct in Reuters poll

* Exports to U.S. +11.8 pct y/y; China +3.4 pct

* Government sees Q3 exports better than year-earlier period

By Faith Hung and Roger Tung

TAIPEI, July 7 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports in June slightly lagged forecasts, but shipments to the United States jumped in a positive sign that its tech firms are reaping the benefits of the season's new smartphone line-up.

Component makers for Apple Inc have started shipping parts for the new iPhone 6, and exports are expected to steadily improve into the third quarter.

"Taiwan companies will be shipping components in big volume in July - September for Apple's new products," said Anita Hsu, economist of Masterlink Securities, Taipei.

Exports in June rose 1.2 percent from a year earlier, slightly missing the average forecast of 1.7 percent in a Reuters poll. The figure compared with 1.4 percent in May.

Taiwan's export figures have been lackluster lately, with May data on exports and export orders both coming in well below expectations, though in line with neighboring countries on a softening of trade throughout the region.

But the governor of Taiwan's central bank said recently that Taiwan's export picture is in better shape this year than it was last year, despite a still-uncertain outlook for the global economy.

The trade-dependent economy is hopeful that accelerating momentum in the United States will help to offset slowing growth in its largest export market, China.

Shipments to the United States, Taiwan's second-largest export market, rose 11.8 percent from a year earlier, while those to China grew 3.4 percent.

Exports to Europe rose 2.8 percent while those to Japan expanded 4.8 percent.

With technology products making up a large share of Taiwan's overall exports, the fortunes of its key tech industry players are closely correlated with the greater trade picture.

Hsu of Masterlink Securities said 2014 exports could beat the government's forecast.

"We expect Taiwan's exports to hit a peak in August, with full-year exports to grow 5 percent year on year thanks to launches of new smartphones. That's better than the government's 5 percent growth forecast," she said.

The island's well-know tech brands are backing up that positive outlook. Smartphone vendor HTC Corp posted last week a quarterly profit slightly above forecasts, jumping 80 percent from the year-ago period

Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, the world's No.1 contract electronics manufacturer, pleased investors when it said it should see at least 10 percent profit growth this year over 2013.

UPDATE 1-HTC's profit surge slightly beats forecasts

* Q2 net T$2.26 billion vs forecast T$2.17 bln

* Rev T$65.06 bln vs guidance range T$65 bln-T$70 bln

TAIPEI, July 3 (Reuters) - Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp on Thursday reported an 80 percent rise in second-quarter net profit from a year ago, slightly beating analyst expectations, as a turnaround strategy started to stem a decline in sales.

April-June net profit reached T$2.26 billion ($75 million) versus a T$2.17 billion mean estimate of 17 analysts polled by Reuters.

The result compared with a T$1.88 billion loss in the previous three months and T$1.25 billion profit in the same quarter a year earlier.

HTC has struggled to retain its market share against competition from the likes of Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, as growth in high-end smartphones slows worldwide.

To return its global share to 10 percent from the current 2 percent, HTC has released flagship model One M8, extended its range of mid-tier handsets and increased its marketing budget.

Revenue was T$65.06 billion in the second quarter, compared with a guidance range of between T$65 billion and T$70 billion given in May.

Shares of HTC ended up 0.4 percent ahead of the earnings release, in line with a rise in the benchmark index.

Global growth in smartphone sales is likely to be 23 percent this year, against 39 percent last year, according to researcher IDC. Average growth from 2013 to 2018 will be 12.3 percent, IDC said.

The prospect puts increasing pressure on high-end smartphone makers to establish distinctive brands, which some analysts say HTC has struggled to do.

The likely release in coming months of a new iPhone from Apple as well as and the proliferation of low-priced feature-packed models in China will add to HTC's challenges, said analyst Richard Ko of KGI Securities.

Only significant inroads in a new product category such as wearable devices - where HTC plans to partner Google Inc - could bring the company the high-growth rates experienced just a few years ago, Ko said.

"Every year there's a new 'hero' product release and a quarterly uptick, but it often fizzles quickly," Ko said ahead of the earnings release, referring to the March launch of the One M8. "This year the competition is even more fierce." (Reporting by Faith Hung and Michael Gold; Editing by David Holmes)

HTC Swings to Profit on New Flagship Phone, Cost Cutting; Revenue Could Struggle With Launch of Next-Generation Phones in Second Half by Rivals Apple, Samsung

TAIPEI¡XThe launch of new flagship and midrange phones, cost cutting and disposal of assets helped HTC Corp. swing back to a profit in the second quarter, but the Taiwanese smartphone maker is still not out of the woods yet.

HTC on Thursday reported a net profit of 2.26 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$75.6 million) in the second quarter, up 80% from the same quarter in 2013 and better than a net loss NT$1.88 billion in the previous quarter. A survey of 16 analysts by Thomson Reuters forecast the second-quarter net profit would average NT$2.09 billion.

The Taoyuan-based smartphone maker also posted an operating profit of NT$2.43 billion, the first after three consecutive quarters of operating losses.

But revenue barely met the company's guidance, which shows it is still struggling to match sales with Samsung Electronics Co. and low-cost Chinese competitors. In the three months ended June 30, revenue totaled NT$65.06 billion, at the low-end of the guided range NT$65 billion-NT$70 billion.

HTC, the top seller of Android smartphones in the U.S. some three years ago, has fallen out of the world's top 10 vendors. The company is betting that a new high-end flagship smartphone, the HTC One (M8), will help reverse declining sales.

Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said in May that HTC had worked to smooth out supply-chain issues, has introduced low-price smartphones in emerging markets and has begun outsourcing some production to cut costs.

HTC has also sold a stake in a Chinese private-equity fund in the last quarter, which the company said it would book a pretax gain of around US$2 million.

But some analysts are still not convinced HTC will soon make a comeback.

As titans Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics are slated to launch their next-generation smartphones in the second half of the year, CIMB analyst Wanli Wang said HTC's revenue could slip further to around NT$45 billion in each of the third and fourth quarters.

"As features of Android phones are becoming more homogeneous to consumers, their life-cycle is now at best two to three months. I don't see a clear catalyst for HTC in the second half this year," Mr. Wang said.

Goldman Sachs also wrote in a research note Thursday, before the earnings release: "We believe 2014 could be the third consecutive year in which the peak quarter is [the second quarter.]"

Samsung Security Platform to Be Part of Next Android Version

SEOUL¡XSamsung Electronics Co. said its mobile security platform will be integrated into the next version of Google Inc.'s Android operating system, a move it hopes will increase Android's appeal among security-minded businesses and governments, where BlackBerry Ltd. remains a formidable player.

The agreement between Google and Samsung is the latest sign of cooperation between the two technology giants, which dominate global smartphone sales by pairing the South Korean company's hardware and marketing know-how with Google's software platform.

Samsung accounted for 30% of global smartphone shipments in the first quarter of the year, with about four in five smartphones running Android, according to research firm IDC.

The announcement came as Google was kicking off its annual I/O developers conference in San Francisco. Samsung's mobile devices run predominantly on Android, though in recent months the company has also been rolling out devices that use its homegrown operating system, known as Tizen.

The new deal with Google will embed the security platform¡Xcalled Knox¡Xin any devices that ship with the latest update of Android. A Samsung spokesman declined to elaborate on how the business decision will affect Samsung sales and distribution.

By opening up its proprietary security technology to rival Android handset makers like LG Electronics Inc., HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., Samsung appears to be betting that it will benefit from its efforts to enhance Android's reputation in the world of enterprise mobile security.

The Samsung spokesman said the collaboration would "benefit all Android users, and hence grow the addressable Android enterprise market for the entire industry."

Samsung says the version of Knox that is being made available to all Android devices will include some key parts of the platform, including a "container" that allows users to house proprietary information in a separate secure space on a device. Other core security features of Knox won't be shared with rival Android vendors, the Samsung spokesman said.

In a statement, Injong Rhee, who runs Samsung's Knox business group, called the deal a "ground breaking partnership with Google," adding that the move was made to promote Android more broadly as "the leading choice for businesses."

Hiroshi Lockheimer, vice president of engineering for Google's Android unit, said Google would bring enterprise-grade security to "all manufacturers participating in the Android ecosystem."

In May, Mr. Rhee said there were 87 million Samsung devices that had been shipped with embedded Knox capabilities.

The move to work closely with Google comes shortly after Samsung said five of its Galaxy-branded smartphones and tablets loaded with Knox received approval from the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency, which allowed them to be listed as an option for Pentagon officials.

Google and Samsung cooperated to address an alleged security breach identified by Israeli security researchers late last year that they said could allow malicious software in Samsung's Galaxy devices to track emails and record data communications.

In a statement that was published in collaboration with Google in January, Samsung said the alleged security gap was more broadly linked to the Android operating system, whose legitimate functions could be used "in an unintended way" to intercept unencrypted application data.

In January, Google and Samsung signed a broad cross-licensing deal on technology patents, though they didn't specify whether the scope of the deal was limited to Android.

UPDATE 1-US court rejects Gemalto's Android patent lawsuit

(Adds details, background, quote)

June 20 (Reuters) - Gemalto NV, the French digital security company, said on Friday that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected its patent claim relating to the Android smart phone operating platform.

Gemalto, which makes smart cards, filed a suit in the United States in October 2010 against Google, Motorola , Samsung and HTC, alleging that their Android applications infringed on its patents.

The company's shares, which are traded in Amsterdam, fell 1.8 percent early on Friday.

"Gemalto's has consistently patented and broadly licensed its innovation so we are certainly disappointed by this judgment with regards to the scope of use of some of our intellectual property," Olivier Piou, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.

Piou said the decision would have "no impact on our historical patents licensing activity, nor on the company's 2017 long-term objectives."

A company spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.

Analysts at ING said the court's rejection was disappointing. "We had estimated that if Gemalto had won the case the company could have been entitled to either a one-off payment in damages, or higher royalty receipts that could amount to 30-50 million euros per annum," they said in a note.

ING analysts estimated Gemalto's patent business contributes 15 million euros on an annual basis, but they said this could well have doubled, at least, if the company had won the lawsuit. "It thus erodes a 3 percent earnings increase potential."

Gemalto employs more than 12,000 staff in 44 countries and had revenues of 2.4 billion euros ($3.27 billion) in 2013. Source text for Eikon: ($1 = 0.7336 Euros) (Reporting by Anthony Deutsch. Editing by Jane Merriman)

SEATTLE, June 18 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's newest mobile device, a smartphone that may sport a 3D screen, is the retailer's latest attempt to exert its influence over the way consumers shop online.

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will preside over a mystery launch on Wednesday near its Seattle campus. Industry observers predict the arrival of a long-rumored smartphone after years of development.

It is unclear if a 3D display, as widely reported, is enough to help the new entree stand out in a crowded field dominated by Apple Inc's seven-year-old iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Galaxy devices. Three-quarters of U.S. consumers online already own a smartphone, according to online data tracking service comScore.

But its introduction reflects how smartphones and tablets are fast becoming how many consumers view and buy items online. Mobile commerce grew at almost twice the rate of online retail during the first quarter, according to comScore.

Analysts said Amazon has more opportunities outside the United States. Only 30 percent of the 5.2 billion phones on the market are smartphones, Topeka Capital Markets analyst Victor Anthony said in a June 5 research note.

"As the world shifts toward mobile, how do you make sure Amazon is front and center?" Jefferson Wang, senior partner at IBB Consulting, said in an interview.

Two sources have said the device contains 3D features visible to the eye without special glasses. Analysts expect Amazon's Prime membership program, which offers features such as movie streaming and two-day delivery, to be tied to the phone.

A phone would represent yet another new area for Amazon, which got its start selling books and has since expanded into everything from original television shows to grocery delivery. It could also boost adoption of an Amazon payments platform.

On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported AT&T Inc would carry the smartphone exclusively, as it did the iPhone for years and a short-lived Facebook phone made by HTC Corp that at one point was discounted to 99 cents.

"Let's hope @amazon doesn't fall victim to the @att curse that is the facebook phone," T-Mobile CEO John Legere tweeted.

A phone would be the third new device Amazon has introduced this year after its FireTV streaming video device and Dash grocery-ordering wand. In recent years, the company has moved more aggressively into hardware, selling its devices at cost in hopes of spurring purchases on Amazon's website.

It has also used its devices to test emerging markets. This year, Amazon began selling the Kindle online in Brazil after years of selling the device in stores. The move gives Amazon a chance to work through some of the country's logistics problems. (Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)

UPDATE 1-Taiwan's sluggish May exports point to more weakness

* May exports +1.4 pct y/y vs +4.0 pct in Reuters poll

* Exports to China +6.4 pct y/y, U.S. +1.0 pct y/y

By Faith Hung and Roger Tung

TAIPEI, June 9 (Reuters) - Taiwan reported sluggish export growth in May and a surprising decline in imports that suggest demand in its key markets and the global tech sector may not be so solid.

The trade-reliant economy is hoping that recovering growth momentum in the United States and Europe will help to partly counter a slowdown in its biggest trading partner, China.

However, imports, most of which are components used for re-exports, shrank 2.3 percent in May from a year earlier, Taiwan's finance ministry said on Monday. That was far below the 8.9 percent increase estimated in a Reuters poll of 11 economists.

Exports edged up 1.4 percent in May, missing the average forecast of 4 percent in the poll.

"It looks like our competitiveness isn't getting much higher in a global context - a few years back we used to register double-digit export growth and that's dropped off dramatically. Now we're looking at max trend growth for this sector at about 5 percent," said analyst Michelle Tsai of Jin Sun Securities, Taipei.

China's exports gained steam in May thanks to firmer global demand, data showed on Sunday, but an unexpected fall in imports signalled weaker domestic demand that could continue to weigh on the world's second-largest economy.

Exports to China in May grew 6.4 percent from a year earlier, but those to the United States -- Taiwan's No.2 export market -- inched up 1 percent.

Shipments to Europe rose 5.8 percent, while those to Japan grew 2.6 percent.

While mainland China is the top destination, it is also a competitor of Taiwan's tech exports.

Recent data from the United States points to a firming recovery after a sub-par winter. Growth in the U.S. services sector accelerated in May, with a key index reaching a high not seen since last August, while employment returned to its pre-recession peak in May.

But the euro zone, where growth has been negative or flat for years, is facing fresh fears of deflation, leading the European Central Bank to cut interest rates to record lows last week.

Taiwan's tech sector has shown mixed readings recently, with smartphone maker HTC posting a 27 percent drop in May sales.

Beleaugured computer vendor Acer Inc managed to swing to a profit in the first quarter, beating expectations of a fourth consecutive net loss.

Forward indicators, however, point to Taiwan gaining from the recovery in global demand with export orders in April edging up to a 15-month high and manufacturing activity showing signs of resilience.

Taiwan's finance ministry also said it sees export growth in June will be positive year on year due to more working days this year.

Home & Digital: A Co-Dependent Relationship With Issues --- With Asus PadFone X, a Smartphone Provides the Brains for a Tablet and the Tablet Brings the Power

First there was the smartphone. Then came the tablet. It seemed simple enough -- two distinct devices with very different screen sizes. But then things got more confusing than the Kardashian clan: Tablets got smaller, phones got bigger, and a new class of giant phones (or tiny tablets) known as "phablets" emerged to bridge the gap between the two.

And just when you thought you had it all figured out, Asus introduces the PadFone X -- a 5-inch Android smartphone that slides into the back of a 9-inch tablet. Think of it as the anti-phablet.

Making the smartphone the beating heart of another device has long been a tech Holy Grail -- remember the MotorolaAtrix or the Palm Foleo? No? OK, so they didn't quite achieve the goal. But Asus stands a much better chance than those failed predecessors thanks to advances in software and hardware and a compelling price tag. The phone and tablet bundle, due later this month, costs just $199 with a two-year AT&T contract. However, like many buy-one-get-one-free deals, not everything is as great as it seems.

The "Fone" part of the PadFone (yes, spelled fonetically) is a lot like other high-end Android smartphones. It has a 1080p screen, a quad-core processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM. It also has a 13-megapixel camera, though the photos I've taken with it are no match in color balance and detail to ones taken with the Samsung Galaxy S5, HTC One or the iPhone 5S.

The phone has features that other premium phones don't, like AT&T's HD Voice. That might not seem like a must-have at the moment, but the improved voice-quality feature is slowly being rolled out in select regions and will be coming to more phones. (The biggest catch: The other caller needs to have an AT&T HD Voice-capable phone as well.)

The phone and the PadFone Station (Asus's name for the "Pad" part) are in a co-dependent relationship: The tablet keeps the phone alive with power so the phone can provide the tablet its brains. Inside the tablet is a large battery, which can simultaneously charge the phone and power up the screen. I can go a solid 2 1/2 days without charging either of them.

When the phone isn't docked, the brainless tablet with the 1920x1200-pixel screen is little more than a cocktail tray. It's only when you slide the phone into the tablet's back pouch that it quickly comes to life. Within three seconds, whatever you were looking at on the phone appears on the 9-inch screen. The handoff is seamless and impressive; the Android 4.4 phone interface quickly shifts to the expanded Android tablet interface.

It isn't perfect. Some Android apps, like Gmail and YouTube, show the tablet-optimized layout while others, like Facebook and Twitter, just display the enlarged phone app with too much white space. Some apps periodically crashed during use, and even in the middle of the handoff between the phone and tablet. (The company plans to fix that in a future software update.)

The Android 4.4 software has been kept fairly clean, but Asus did meddle in spots. I had to disable the browser toolbar that looked like adware and replace the cluttered software keyboard. (Asus will sell a $99 Bluetooth keyboard dock if you want to turn this contraption into a laptop.)

There are times when having the larger screen to read or type on was useful, and I really like getting texts and phone calls on my tablet. No, you don't have to hold the big tablet to your face. There is a speakerphone mode, though calls were muffled despite the front-facing speakers.

Yet those are the only scenarios where I found the PadFone's physical syncing to be better than the wireless syncing I have with my phone and tablet. Thanks to the cloud, I don't ever wish I could plug my phone into my iPad. Netflix lets me pick up right where I left off in a movie, the Kindle app saves the page I'm on in my book and Google Docs does the same for an article I'm working on. Just this week, Apple announced call syncing, wireless file transfers and other new ways to keep Macs, iPhones and iPads in lock step.

And to provide this so-called convenience, the whole PadFone package turned out to be exceedingly bulky. The phone is so chunky and unsightly, I found it hard to size it up seriously against its closest competitors. The rounded black brushed-metal edges and bulky design reminded me of LG and HTC phones -- from five years ago.

The humpbacked tablet has similar design shortcomings, but at least it has an excuse for its thickness -- that amazing battery. Though that doesn't explain the picture-frame-sized bezel surrounding the screen. At an inch thick on each side, it is far too wide for a modern tablet.

That's why the idea of the PadFone falls short for me. Our very slim and well-designed phones, tablets and laptops may be more expensive, but they're all far more portable and functional than Asus's heroic hybrid attempt. Yes, that even includes phablets like the Galaxy Note 3. Because, despite its singular name, the PadFone doesn't let me carry one less device in my bag. It's still a separate tablet and phone -- heavy and thick ones at that.

Dubious Traffic: Strange Case of the Invisible Video Ads

Corrections & Amplifications

Adap.tv was misspelled as Adapt.tv in a Page One article on Tuesday about invisible video ads. Also, the name of video tech firm Mixpo was incorrectly given as Mixpoand.

(WSJ May 28, 2014)

(END)

The website USFunVideos.com is unremarkable in most respects, displaying snapshots of outdoor scenes and cooking videos. But recently the site contained something else: several tiny websites, smaller than a needlepoint.

These tiny sites, each the size of a single pixel on a computer screen, carried little content. But each served up ads, videos too small to see with the naked eye.

And the array of big advertisers -- such as JP Morgan Chase, Coca-Cola Co.'s Minute Maid orange juice and smartphone maker HTC Corp. -- were charged every time someone clicked on USFunVideos.com, and the tiny sites played the ads that couldn't be seen.

The sleight of hand is the kind of problem that ad executives and security firms say is now widespread across the Internet. Lured by the promise of advertising they could be sure was being seen by the right people, marketers are now contending with a deep bag of tricks that includes Web-crawling robots, server-based "drone pools" and the pixel-size video sites that has them paying for dubious Internet traffic.

Wenda Harris Millard, president and COO of the ad consultancy Medialink, estimates that as much as 25% of online ad revenue is wasted on fraud and piracy. Similarly, a February report from audience-research firm comScore found that 36% of online ad impressions, or views, are generated by nonhumans.

Video ads, fast rising in popularity, have become particularly vulnerable to fraud. In December, 188.2 million Americans watched a total of 52.4 billion videos, according to comScore. A year earlier, 181.7 million viewers consumed 39 billion videos. With figures like that, the commercial-like video format has become irresistible to traditional advertisers such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's Corp. and General Motors Co.

One calculation, by eMarketer, estimates that Web video ad spending will roughly double to $8.04 billion by 2016. Most of that money goes to top video sites like YouTube, Yahoo and Hulu as well as online sites of TV networks.

But a number of other, obscure players are surreptitiously getting in on the action.

Consider the path taken by one of the invisible ads that ended up on USFunVideos. The rogue ads were initially discovered by Vindico, an advertising-technology company that helped the Journal identify several shrunken sites. While the companies confirmed that their ads weren't supposed to be on USFunVideos, none of them had been aware of the breach.

A spokesman for JP Morgan Chase acknowledged the company inadvertently paid for the spots to appear. A spokesman for HTC said its media agencies have "robust monitoring solutions in place" to guard against fraud. A Minute Maid spokeswoman said that "known fraud is automatically stripped out" of ads counted, and billed, to the company.

As for USFunVideos, it is registered to Malcom Dawn of Malaga, Spain, according to the domain tracking site Whois.com. A person answering the phone number listed on the account said they didn't know Mr. Dawn.

According to HTC's own findings, its ad traveled through three middlemen, including the ad network OneScreen and the ad-buying tech company TubeMogul. Eventually, it landed on one of the shrunken sites on USFunVideos, where no one could see it. (See how video ad fraud can happen in an interactive graphic.)

TubeMogul CEO Brett Wilson says the firm quickly blocked the site from its ad chain, and refunded HTC less than one dollar for 53 fake views. OneScreen didn't return several phone calls seeking comment.

JP Morgan Chase placed its ad through AOL Inc.'s Adapt.tv, but the spot subsequently was handed off to three more firms before it ended up on USFunVideos.

"It's always a big deal when advertisers can't control where their ads end up in the supply chain," says Mike Turcotte, a senior vice president at Zenith Media, which handles JP Morgan Chase's online advertising. He said that the USFunVideos incident represented a small amount of the bank's total ad budget but declined to give any figures, or say whether the bank had been reimbursed for the fraud.

The ads are lucrative. A video ad on a niche website or blog can command as much as $30 per thousand views, compared with 20 cents for static display ads for the same amount of traffic, estimate industry executives.

That helps to explain why fraudsters are deploying a variety of tactics, including embedding invisible sites within sites to exaggerate page views and gin up fake traffic.

By hiding behind bogus domain registrations, masking their digital tracks and working out of hard-to-trace regions, perpetrators are extremely difficult to catch.

Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman says the online ad world is doing a poor job of policing itself. "Businesses are absolutely getting screwed," says Mr. Edelman, who also serves as a paid consultant to companies combating ad fraud. "If you were selling barrels of excellent apples, you should be furious if some guy is out there selling barrels of rotten apples," he says.

Historically, online advertising has been driven by what people in the industry refer to as "direct response" ads that urge viewers to take an action with messages like "Click here to sign up for a credit card" or "Win a free iPad!"

With people consuming more video on the Web, motion ads are attracting more traditional "brand advertisers" -- from clothing designers to car companies. Their video promos are less about generating an immediate sale than honing an image or value, much like a television commercial. In some cases, marketers are running the same ads created for TV online, shifting more ad spending from the tube to the Web in the process.

As more of their ads migrate online, traditional marketers may be ill equipped to deal with potential fraud. That is because TV and print advertisers are mostly concerned about getting their ads seen by the right demographic groups. And they commonly deal directly, via phone and fax, with sales reps from media companies to place their spots.

Web advertisers, conversely, use automated software to purchase ads via exchanges, networks and other middlemen -- a process that leaves less transparency as to where an ad will actually end up. Traditional advertisers, therefore, may be less savvy about navigating these channels.

For example, an ad can start with an established ad exchange, which sells it off to a less well-known firm, which ultimately sends the ad to a shell website -- an action that takes place in the blink of an eye, with little, if any screening. Many of these transactions are automated, so exchanges aren't even aware of what companies are buying what inventory.

Under this type of system, "there is no transparency guaranteed," says Jeff Lanctot, a former ad executive and CEO of the video tech firm Mixpoand. "Some percentage of the sites [advertisers buy] are not visited by humans, but by bots," or web robots programmed to visit many sites at once and mimic human views.

Some industry veterans believe that the middlemen have little incentive to shut down fraud since the more transactions they handle the more money they make. "Everyone along the chain makes money," says Tom Phillips, CEO of Dstillery, a marketing technology company. "More volume, more money."

Advertisers and agencies are "under pressure to deliver a certain volume for a campaign at a certain price," adds Mr. Lanctot. "Banning multiple providers may hinder those attempts. So fraud is tolerated."

Some ad exchanges dispute this assessment. Rather than turning a blind eye to fraud, they say they are fighting it.

"Adapt.tv is focused on the long term-strategy of building an industry where brands and agencies can safely and securely invest their media dollars -- and not on short-term revenue," says a spokesman for Adapt.tv, which was acquired last year by AOL.

One video ad exchange, called Spotxchange, says it uses various filtering technologies to root out scams. The company says it ends up blocking 10% to 15% of the ad inventory the company handles. "We invest a lot of money in multiple technology vendors and dedicated staff to monitor our video ad inventory," says CEO Michael Shehan. "But fraud literally steals money from legitimate publishers, so it's worth the investment."

Tactics are evolving. For instance, investigators say that fraudsters are now renting giant servers with the capacity to mimic millions of personal computers. Known as cloud computers, they can be deployed across hundreds of websites to trick advertisers into paying for fake visitors.

A shift to cloud computing may also be fueling an expansion of fraud into video ads, some researchers say. Cloud-based "drone pools," as the latest schemes are dubbed, perform more reliably for the scammers than an army of PCs that have been infected with viruses. These drone pools, say researchers at security firm MdotLabs, can't be switched off by users with antivirus software, meaning the bots will carry on.

Mr. Edelman -- whose office sits in Harvard's serene Baker Library, which featured an exhibit on "The Art of American Advertising, 1865-1910" on a recent morning -- says he has seen other miniaturized websites like USFunVideos running what are essentially invisible ads. In one case, he estimates, the ads had gone through nine different exchanges, ad networks and other third parties.

Part of a growing cadre of ad-centric Internet-security consultants, the professor works with paying clients such as Microsoft, eBay and Verizon. He says he has built a series of Web crawlers that scour the Web, taking screenshots of ads that end up in unsavory places.

He claims he is able to discern patterns by reading the data contained in Web addresses, so that he can tell what any specific ad is supposed to look like. And with that information, he says he can follow a company's ads wherever they go -- including places that advertisers didn't intend for them to land.

Multiple computers aid him in his quest, some deliberately loaded up with viruses and adware, and others that are "clean." He instructs his bots to venture out across the Internet to check out suspicious websites.

Mr. Edelman, who rides his bike to Harvard every day, keeps a list on his wall of companies he has targeted. Some firms are crossed out, indicating the professor's efforts to expose their misdeeds. After naming names on his blog, one company on the list called the Harvard Business School dean to complain. The dean's office confirmed the phone call but declined to comment.

Identifying specific people behind online fraud is another problem entirely. Perpetrators are experts at hiding their digital tracks, and many operate outside the U.S.

The law is also somewhat murky in the area. While it is illegal to manipulate another person's computer, for example, other illicit activity is less cut and dry, says Alan Chapell, founder of Chapell & Associates, a law firm specializing in the ad business. "A lot of ad fraud, such as fake sites and fake traffic, are difficult to prove," he says. "If you're a regulator, you really look for slam dunks. Grey areas are sort of hard."

U.S. law enforcement actions suggest at least some of the activity is coming from Eastern Europe. Last year, for instance, two men from Estonia pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court for taking part in a $14 million case involving online ad fraud schemes, according to federal prosecutors.

In the case of USFunVideos, the site itself doesn't list any contact information for its principals.

Digging deeper, Mdot's team discovered a company domain name associated with the site. That domain, oneemedia.com, redirects to Mojhosting.sk, a Slovakian domain-registration company. Researchers at Mdot were unable to find any information about oneemedia, which lists no contact information.

Even as more cases of fraud are discovered, many think that the battle against the scammers, with their ever-changing arsenal of tricks, is unlikely to end soon.

"Anytime you have a scheme and start to close one door, there's another door that opens," said Elias Manousos, chief executive of security firm RiskIQ. "Especially when there's this kind of money on the line."

Lenovo Group Ltd.'s chief executive warned of slower growth and hotter competition in China's smartphone market but said his company will overcome challenges through its purchase of Google Inc.'s Motorola Mobility handset business.

"Now is a very tough period" for smartphone makers in China, CEO Yang Yuanqing said in an interview. "I believe China is the most fiercely competitive smartphone market in the world."

Mr. Yang's comments came as the Chinese personal-computer maker on Wednesday reported another quarter of solid earnings growth. Profit for its fiscal fourth quarter rose 25% from a year earlier, helped by stronger sales of computers and mobile devices.

Lenovo, which last year overtook Hewlett-Packard Co. as the world's largest PC maker by volume, is betting on smartphones as its next growth engine. In January, it said it would buy the Motorola business for $2.91 billion, a week after the Chinese company said it would purchase International Business Machines Corp.'s low-end server business for $2.3 billion. The Motorola and IBM deals await U.S. regulatory approval.

Mr. Yang said Motorola has strong relationships with carriers in North and South America. Lenovo plans to sell Motorola-branded smartphones in the U.S. following the deal, rather than handsets with the Lenovo logo, he said.

The Motorola acquisition means Lenovo is betting heavily on handsets as China's smartphone market shows signs of a slowdown after years of robust growth.

Total smartphone shipments in China stood at 97.5 million units in the first quarter, down 3% from the fourth, according to research firm Canalys. Nearly 65% of China's mobile-phone subscribers already use smartphones, Canalys analyst Nicole Peng estimated.

Lenovo is the second-largest smartphone vendor in China, after Samsung Electronics Co. But it faces challenges from foreign and domestic competitors, such as Apple Inc., HTC Corp. and fast-growing Chinese startup Xiaomi Inc.

Mr. Yang said the Chinese smartphone market will become less crowded as some players fail to survive the intense competition. At that time, Lenovo's handset business in China will become a more profitable, sustainable business, he said, similar to what happened in the PC market.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 16 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and Google Inc's Motorola Mobility unit have agreed to settle all patent litigation between them over smartphones, ending one of the highest-profile lawsuits in technology.

In a joint statement on Friday, the companies said the settlement does not include a cross license to their respective patents.

"Apple and Google have also agreed to work together in some areas of patent reform," the statement said.

Apple and companies that make phones using Google's Android software have filed dozens of such lawsuits against one another around the world to protect their technology. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs called Android a "stolen product."

Google and Apple informed a federal appeals court in Washington that their cases against each other should be dismissed, according to filings on Friday. However, the deal does not apply to Apple's litigation against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.

Apple has battled Google and what once were the largest adopters of its Android mobile software, partly to try to curb the rapid expansion of the free, rival operating system.

But it has been unable to slow Android's ascendancy, which is now installed on an estimated 80 percent of new phones sold every year. Motorola, the U.S. company that pioneered the mobile phone, no longer ranks among the biggest smartphone makers.

Both Motorola and HTC Corp have been eclipsed by Chinese Android adopters such as Lenovo Group Ltd - which is buying Motorola - and Huawei and Xiaomi.

The most high-profile case between Apple and Motorola began in 2010. Motorola accused Apple of infringing several patents, including one essential to how cellphones operate on a 3G network, while Apple said Motorola violated its patents to certain smartphone features.

The cases were consolidated in a Chicago federal court. However, Judge Richard Posner dismissed it in 2012 shortly before trial, saying neither company had sufficient evidence to prove its case. Last month, the appeals court gave the iPhone manufacturer another chance to win a sales ban against Motorola.

Apple's biggest victory against Android came against Samsung, where U.S. juries have awarded Apple more than $1 billion in damages. Those verdicts are on appeal, and despite years of court challenges to Android, Apple has not been able to win a crippling sales injunction.

Google acquired Motorola Mobility in 2012 for $12.5 billion, and this year announced it was selling Motorola Mobility's handset business to Lenovo, while keeping the vast majority of the patents.

The case at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Apple Inc vs. Motorola Mobility, case number 2012-1528, -1549. (Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Andre Grenon and Mohammad Zargham)

The Cheap Smartphone Revolution

An iPhone costs $649. Other makers are talking about the $35 smartphone, or maybe even $25. That might explain why Apple has been so litigious over patents and why the company is spending big -- about 30% more than last year -- to develop new features. On May 2, Apple was awarded $119 million in damages after a court ruled that Samsung had infringed on patents by copying Apple's features, designs and technology. But damage payments won't stop what's coming for the industry: We're entering a revolutionary era of the cheap smartphone.

About 285 million smartphones were shipped in the first quarter of 2014, according to Strategy Analytics, and more than a billion will ship this year. Not cellphones -- smartphones. Samsung and Apple accounted for almost half of them.

The business is staggeringly lucrative. The research firm iSuppli rips apart smartphones to figure out what the materials cost. iSuppli estimates that the materials in an 16-gigabyte iPhone 5S cost $191, though the product sells for $649 without a contract with AT&T or Verizon. The iPhone 5C materials come in at $166, selling for $549 without a contract. The Samsung Galaxy S5 contains $251 of materials.

But we're not buying chips and glass. What we pay for is the experience of the look, feel and touch -- for the software, operating system, graphical user interface and apps. Samsung and most of the other 85% non-Apple smartphones use Android, which Google provides free, making up for Android development costs by selling boatloads of search ads.

Apple thinks that its software is, unlike Android, worth more than free. The company filed the patent suit against Samsung and HTC to slow down Android's development, but also to try to maintain the value of Apple's code-writing that provides all the magical features. But it has been seven years since the iPhone was introduced. Commoditization, when consumers realize that your product is no different from what your competitor sells, is creeping up. When personal computers began, they sold for $5,000. Google now sells a laptop for $249. The same downward price pressure is about to happen with smartphones.

As Business Insider reported from the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February, the buzz was about a Chinese manufacturer showcasing a $35 smartphone and about Firefox's flirting with selling one for $25. My contacts in China report similar prices.

We're entering a new stage -- call it the post-iPhone era. Cheap. Smart. Ubiquitous. Profits then flow to the best services that utilize smartphones. Facebook is cleaning up with its mobile-ad sales. Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram are all driven by smartphones. Uber and hundreds of new apps wouldn't exist without smartphones. It makes sense that Apple is interested in acquiring Beats Audio for a reported $3.2 billion. And all this is at a billion smartphones. What happens at three billion devices? Or four billion?

First, dirt-cheap smartphones will have astonishing implications for the global economy: Smartphones are a productivity platform for wealth creation. Americans may waste days playing Piano Tiles or Clash of Clans, but the developing world can build lives with a $35 smartphone. Roughly 20% of the world population earns less than $2 a day, and the cost of a smartphone just dropped from a year's earnings to three weeks' pay. Now that's an antipoverty program.

Google has launched Project Loon, bringing the Internet to rural and developing areas through high-altitude balloons. Facebook and Google are rushing to invest in drones to loop around and provide mobile connectivity. Poor villages and townships will finally have a platform to escape despair. Now we need applications to use $5-a-day workers to eyeball documents, photos, blueprints and anything that requires human cognitive skills, things that can't yet and may never be coded into artificial-intelligence algorithms. This is the greatest challenge for Silicon Valley that it doesn't even know about.

The other good news is for consumers in wealthy countries -- those of us with "First World problems" like butt dialing. Apple and Samsung will struggle to maintain profits on high-end products, and so get ready for a horse race of features. We've already seen Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Samsung has Smart Scroll Eye Tracking. Apple's Siri answers spoken questions. Samsung offers a Galaxy Gear watch that works with their phones. None yet justify the $649 price tag.

A lot will be thrown at us to see what sticks. Larger displays? Curved or bendable displays? Fitness trackers? Google Glass? Bluetooth-connected rings to allow hand-waving gestures instead of requiring clicks? No-touch mobile payments? Medical sensors to track heart rate or glucose levels? Who knows? Let's try them all. Personally, I'm hoping someone comes up with a personal assistant to whisper in my ear throughout the day.

Corporate News: Beats Stars Sidle Up to Apple --- Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre Could Help CEO Tim Cook Broker Deals in Music Industry

Music mogul Jimmy Iovine gravitates to the limelight in a way that previously might have made him ill-suited to work at Apple Inc., which historically had one face: Steve Jobs.

But as Apple completes a deal to buy headphone and streaming-service company Beats Electronics LLC from Mr. Iovine and his co-founder, rap star Dr. Dre, both men are likely to take senior positions with the Cupertino, Calif., tech company, according to people familiar with the matter, commuting from the Los Angeles area to Silicon Valley -- or meetings elsewhere -- as needed.

Though the details of the men's potential Apple assignments remain unclear, the mere possibility underscores how Apple's corporate culture has loosened under the leadership of Mr. Jobs's successor, Chief Executive Tim Cook. Though Mr. Iovine and Dr. Dre -- whose real name is Andre Young -- would likely be the coolest kids by a long shot on Apple's campus, they aren't the first big personalities Mr. Cook has welcomed to Apple headquarters from flashier industries. Last year he hired former Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts to run retail, for example. He also posed for the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek with Apple executives Jonathan Ive and Craig Federighi -- a display that would have been unthinkable in the Jobs era, when Apple's products were the only other stars permitted to shine.

Assuming Apple seals the deal to buy Beats, Mr. Iovine will leave his longtime post as chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M records, a division of Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, according to a person familiar with the matter, though it isn't clear how soon he would depart. Universal, which owns a 14% stake in Beats and would reap roughly $500 million from a $3.2 billion acquisition, is likely to let Mr. Iovine split before his contract expires early next year.

A spokeswoman for Messrs. Iovine and Young declined to comment.

Interscope President John Janick, 35 years old, has for more than 18 months been overseeing day-to-day operations at the label while Mr. Iovine focused his attention on Beats and other ventures such as his role on "American Idol." In 2013, Mr. Janick guided the label through its most profitable year on record.

Mr. Iovine, 61, may not have landed a gig at Apple under Mr. Jobs, but the two were close friends, and Mr. Jobs was sometimes a house guest at Mr. Iovine's Los Angeles home. Among the acts Mr. Iovine has produced are Tom Petty, Patti Smith and U2, for whom he helped win a deal to create a specially designed iPod preloaded with the band's music.

While Mr. Iovine's rock-star temperament could still ruffle some feathers in tech-centric Cupertino, it may help Apple broker deals in the music industry and appeal to the younger consumers who gravitate to Beats headphones.

He has been just as creative as a deal maker. After co-founding Interscope in 1990 with retail and media heir Ted Field and Time Warner Inc., he wrested away Time Warner's 50% share of the fast-growing label five years later for a discounted price of $115 million, after a Time Warner shareholder complained that Interscope's "gangsta rap" was offensive. Mr. Iovine resold that same stake a year later for $200 million to MCA Records, which was eventually absorbed by what is now Universal Music.

Mr. Iovine and Mr. Young, who co-founded Beats in 2006, profited again after selling a 50.1% stake in Beats to Taiwan's HTC Corp. for around $300 million, only to buy back half of what they sold a year later for around $150 million.

The pending Apple deal is the richest of them all, a $3.2 billion payday for Mr. Iovine and his backers that Dr. Dre has already proclaimed on YouTube will make him "the first billionaire in hip-hop."

REFILE-UPDATE 2-Apple close to buying Beats for $3.2 bln -source

(In 16th paragraph, corrects Apple CEO's last name to Cook instead of Cooks)

By Nadia Damouni, Christina Farr and Nicola Leske

SAN FRANCISCO, May 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is close to paying a record $3.2 billion for Beats Electronics, two people with knowledge of the matter said, an expensive foray into music streaming and headphone gear that would mark a departure for the usually cash-conservative iPhone maker.

Both companies are hashing out details and the envisioned deal could still fall through, one person told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.

A second source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Apple was in the market for a subscription-based music service to complement its "iRadio" ad-based offering, launched in 2013 as part of an attempt to jump into a music-streaming arena then split between a handful of startups such as Pandora Inc.

Founded by rapper Dr. Dre and legendary music producer Jimmy Iovine, Beats Electronics is best known for its "Beats by Dr Dre" line of trendy headphones that vie with the likes of Skullcandy Inc, Sennheiser Electronic and Bose Corp. This year, it launched a music service that has won plaudits for its slick design and human music curation, versus the computer-algorithms that determine playlists for most of its rivals.

But analysts on Thursday questioned whether Beats, valued at just $1 billion during its last funding round in September, was worth that price. Apple had more than $130 billion in cash as of the end of March, but the vast majority of that is parked abroad and investors have called on the company to return more cash in the form of dividends and buybacks.

Apple-watchers have speculated that the company that upended the music industry - and today is the single largest seller of tunes - was contemplating a Spotify-like on-demand music service to go with iRadio service and iTunes.

"This is really puzzling," said Forrester analyst James McQuivey, who said there was huge overlap between the two companies' customer base. "You buy companies today to get technologies that no one else  or customers that no one has."

"They must have something hidden  under the hood," he said.

In two of the largest deals this year, Facebook paid $19 billion for WhatsApp and its half-billion users, and it paid $2 billion for Oculus VR and its cutting-edge virtual reality headset.

Apple declined to comment on the report. Beats Electronics did not respond to requests for comment on the news, which was reported first by the Financial Times.

UNDER PRESSURE?

Apple has not made a billion-dollar acquisition in at least a decade. The company prefers to develop and design its products in-house, though it has tended to pay several hundred million dollars for small but important bits of technology to propel its core consumer electronics business, such as the acquisition of PA Semi in 2008 that led to the processor now found in all iPhones.

The company has been under pressure to try to revitalize growth as iPhone sales slow in a rapidly maturing market. Critics have also accused the company of slowly "losing its cool" and innovative edge to new and upcoming technology companies, and missing the music-streaming bandwagon.

Technology giants Google and Amazon began jockeying for position in music last year, looking at ways to make streaming profitable and to develop a service seen as crucial to retaining users in an increasingly mobile environment. For Google and Apple especially, the endeavor was critical to ensure users remain loyal to their mobile products.

They realized they had to stake out a place or risk ceding control of one of the largest components of mobile device usage. Analysts estimate roughly half of smartphone users listen to music on their device, making it the fourth most popular media-related activity after social networking, games and news.

Apple launched its own streaming music service last year, hoping to jump into the fast-expanding arena as growth of its iTunes service falters.

Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook met with Iovine, the Beats CEO, last year on a potential partnership involving Beats's planned music-streaming service, Reuters reported in March, citing sources. (http://r.reuters.com/ter29v)

Dre - who guided the careers of a string of rap artists such as Eminem and 50 Cent - compared his company with Apple in 2011.

"We're trying to eventually be second to Apple. And I don't think that's a bad position," Dre told The Fader music website.(http://r.reuters.com/cur29v)

Beats Electronics received a $500 million investment from Carlyle Group in September that valued the company at over $1 billion. It also bought back in September a 24.84 percent stake held by Taiwan smartphone maker HTC Corp , which once held as much as 50.1 percent of the company.

UPDATE 1-Taiwan April exports outperform as tech shipments hit record

* April exports +6.2 pct vs +5.79 pct in Reuters poll

* Exports to China +5 pct y/y, U.S. +6.9 pct y/y

* Tech exports reach new single-month record

By Jeanny Kao and Michael Gold

TAIPEI, May 7 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports in April rose faster than expected boosted by record tech shipments, a development that bodes well for its key electronic firms and underpins the island's growth prospects.

The tech industry, the main driver of Taiwan's export machine, has been facing upheaval from changing consumer tastes worldwide but local companies have lately benefitted from the roll-out of new models of smartphones and tablets.

The Ministry of Finance said that exports of electronic goods in April reached $8.16 billion, a record high, as firms moved up the value chain producing high-margin devices such as top-of-the-line phones.

Exports overall increased by 6.2 percent last month from a year earlier, beating the average forecast of 5.79 percent in a Reuters poll of 11 economists.

The figure compares with 2 percent export growth in March - a modest figure that, nonetheless, also beat expectations.

"Taiwanese manufacturers continue to occupy the most advanced rung of the global technological supply chain," the ministry said in a statement.

Exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, rose 5 percent, while those to the United States saw a 6.9 percent gain.

Exports to Europe jumped 13.1 percent, while those to Japan fell 3.2 percent.

Strong export growth bolsters the island's first-quarter GDP expansion of 3.04 percent - the highest since the fourth quarter of 2012 - in which both exports and domestic consumption were cited as major growth factors.

A slowdown in China is viewed as a potential threat to Taiwan's export machine. Many local manufacturers have factories on the mainland or ship components to China for assembly.

Chinese GDP growth clocked in at its slowest pace in 18 months during the first quarter, causing Taiwan's exports to China to contract slightly in March.

However, Tim Condon, an economist at ING in Singapore, said that a slowing of the Chinese economy could be a net positive for Taiwan if it leads to more consumption-fuelled growth.

"This could definitely be a virtuous cycle, with Taiwan outsourcing manufacturing to places like Southeast Asia, but then importing to China," Condon said.

He said progress in cross-strait pacts such as the controversial Trade in Services Agreement, which has been the target of heated protests, would be crucial for this development.

Data on imports to China in April, to be released on Thursday, are expected to see a tiny 0.30 percent increase, on the back of a substantial 11.27 percent fall in March.

BRIGHT TECH PICTURE

The few large tech firms that have reported their first-quarter earnings have painted a relatively bright picture for the first half of the year.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, the world's largest contract chip maker, targets record revenue in the second quarter as more of its chips are installed in high-end smartphones worldwide.

Even struggling smartphone firm HTC Corp said on Tuesday it was likely to break even or book a profit in the first half, after losing substantial market share to rivals Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. (Editing by Jacqueline Wong)

Corporate News: HTC, Once a Smartphone Leader, Struggles to Return to Profit

TAIPEI -- Once a leading mobile-phone maker has been knocked off its throne, can it ever come back?

That is the question facing smartphone maker HTC Corp. as it forecast Tuesday a return to profit in the second quarter but warned its revenue would continue to fall.

For many handset makers, the track record isn't good. Experts say that few except Apple Inc. and Motorola Mobility have pulled off turnarounds, and Motorola's reprieve was temporary. In both cases, the key was producing megahit products: the iPhone and the Razr.

"Very few companies have been able to withstand this kind of spiral," said Alvin Kwock, J.P. Morgan's Asia head of technology hardware, adding that HTC will need an innovative product that competitors can't easily counter.

Just three years ago, HTC was the world's leading smartphone maker using Google Inc.'s Android operating system, but it has struggled in recent years to match sales with Samsung Electronics Co. and low-cost Chinese competitors. In March, the company unveiled a high-end flagship smartphone called the HTC One (M8). The device features a sleek metal design, and the company is betting that the new smartphone will help reverse declining sales.

Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said Tuesday that HTC is on the mend. The company has worked to smooth out supply-chain problems for its high-end devices, and has introduced smartphones priced as low as $145 this quarter as it begins to outsource some production to contract manufacturers.

"We're seeing an encouraging sign, a good start. [The question is] how we sustain it," said Mr. Chang, speaking to reporters.

HTC said it expects to return to profit in the second quarter after three quarters of operating losses, but forecast revenue will fall to between 65 billion New Taiwan dollars and NT$70 billion (US$2.16 billion and US$2.32 billion), from NT$70.7 billion a year earlier. The company also said it is selling a 9.5% stake in a Chinese private-equity fund for US$69 million.

HTC got its first big break in 2007 amid a product vacuum. After the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007, HTC was the first to provide a viable alternative based on the Android operating system. The success helped HTC rise into the world's largest smartphone vendor by shipments in 2011.

"When HTC was doing well, it was because it had an early alternative to the iPhones, not because it had a strong global brand," said Willy Shih, a Harvard Business School professor.

HTC's fortunes changed when Samsung began to tap its massive marketing purse with the launch of its Galaxy smartphones and as an influx of low-cost Chinese competitors. Tighter finances have also made it more difficult for HTC to retain talent. A number of executives have departed the company over the past year. Most recently, design chief Scott Croyle has stepped down.

[Nathan Olivarez-Giles answers readers' technology questions]

In this week's #AskWSJD, reader Daniel Fujii asks if there are any smartphone apps that mimic the new HTC One M8's UFocus camera feature, which lets users adjust the focus of a photo after it's been shot. The HTC pulls this off by using a two-camera setup, with one camera dedicated to recording depth info.

Unfortunately for Daniel and anyone else who doesn't buy the newest HTC One, there are no apps for phones running iOS, Android or even Windows Phone that offer the same feature. There are plenty of great photo apps out there that have a feature called tilt shift, which blurs certain parts of a picture to simulate the effect of refocusing a photo.

Our top choices: TiltShift Generator on iOS, Awesome Miniature on Android, and, on either operating system, Snapseed and Instagram. For Windows Phone, there's Tilt Shift.

If you own an iPhone and want to take your smartphone photo editing beyond tilt shift, there are plenty of other apps to check out. VSCO Cam, which is also available on Android, has become popular for its photo filters. Mextures enables you to create "formulas" from 130 options of light leaks, grain and color gradients. And Camera+ offers a broad range of editing features with iCloud syncing too.

But for people interested in focus tricks beyond a smartphone, there is the Lytro camera, which uses an entirely different approach called light-field photography to allow you to change the focus of already snapped photos.

Lytro cameras use special sensors to capture not only the light hitting a lens, but also the direction of the light. The result is essentially a three-dimensional data capture that allows images to be manipulated after the fact using Lytro's special software.

The entry-level Lytro camera sells for $249.

UPDATE 2-HTC steps up advertising to regain once-high market share

* Q2 sales likely T$65-70 bln vs T$71 bln year earlier

* Expects to break even or profit in first half

* Shares rise for fifth day, reach nine-month high   (Recasts, adds executive comments, context)

By Michael Gold

TAIPEI, May 6 (Reuters) - Taiwan's HTC Corp is stepping up advertising to ensure sales of the One M8 smartphone live up to the new flagship's critical acclaim, and win the vendor a bigger share of the developed markets it once dominated.

HTC reached the top of the U.S. market in the third quarter of 2011, when it sold one in every 10 smartphones worldwide, according to Strategy Analytics. But its global share dropped to 2 percent along with a share price which plummeted 86 percent.

The fall from grace was speeded up last year when sales of predecessor flagship One M7 failed to match the phone's rave reviews because of disruptions in the supply chain and a marketing campaign widely dismissed as brash and confusing.

HTC plans to avoid a similar outcome befalling the M8 with "more effective and efficient marketing," Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said at a quarterly investor conference on Tuesday.

The M8 will lead a diversified product portfolio that will help HTC retrieve market share in developed countries, Chang said, without giving specific targets.

The M8's toned-down advertising campaign with actor Gary Oldman has been well received by commentators, who said it is an improvement over last year's campaign fronted by Robert Downey Jr. So far, the M8 is selling quicker than the M7, Chang said.

"We are increasing our media ad buys in 2014 over 2013."

Even so, HTC expects revenue to land in a range of T$65 billion ($2.16 billion) to T$70 billion in the April-June quarter, slightly below the T$71 billion of the same period a year earlier.

That would nevertheless be about double the T$33 billion booked in January-March, when ineffective marketing and weak M7 sales contributed to a net loss that was wider than analysts estimated at T$1.88 billion.

The first quarter finished in March with HTC ending 28 months of on-year sales declines. HTC logged another sales rise in April indicating strong shipments of the M8, which was released in late March around a year after the M7.

The start bodes well for the second quarter which Chang said is likely to see HTC return to profit, helping the company break even in the first half or even end in the black.

Shares of HTC rose for a fifth straight day before the briefing on Tuesday, hitting a nine-month high on expectations of a strong revenue forecast. They closed up 3.6 percent compared with a 0.5 percent gain in the benchmark index.

MID-TIER

HTC's future is not as dependent on its flagship model in advanced markets as it once was, as sales of lower-priced models in emerging economies are growing at an increasing rate.

The high-end market is slowing from its peak of just a few years ago when HTC, as a relative unknown, pitted itself against established consumer technology companies such as Apple Inc .

Addressing that shift, Chang said HTC will "dominate the mid-tier" and "participate in the affordable segment," which he defined as prices in a range of $150 to $200.

"We are aiming for incremental market share gain at all levels," Chang said. "The (M8) volume this year is better than last year, so if the market stays the same then our market share will grow."

TAIPEI, May 6 (Reuters) - Taiwanese smartphone vendor HTC Corp said on Tuesday it projects revenue in April-June to almost match that of a year earlier thanks primarily to sales of new flagship One M8 beating those of its predecessor.

Revenue is likely to be in a range of T$65 billion ($2.16 billion) to T$70 billion, compared with T$70.67 billion in the same period a year prior, Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said at a quarterly investor conference.

Chang said the manufacturer expects a second-quarter gross profit margin of 21.3 percent to 22 percent, and earnings-per-share of T$2.21 to T$3.

HTC is likely to break even or book a profit in the first half, Chang said, after reporting a loss in January-March that was wider than analysts estimated at T$1.88 billion. ($1 = 30.1040 Taiwan Dollars) (Reporting by Michael Gold; Editing by Christopher Cushing)

Corporate News: HTC Starts Outsourcing Production to Cut Costs

TAIPEI -- HTC Corp. began to outsource production of some of its smartphones for the first time this quarter, looking to slash costs and better pursue new customers in developing markets.

The unprofitable Taiwanese smartphone maker has selected Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Compal Electronics Inc. and China's Wingtech Group for at least three of the new models in its midprice Desire series, said people familiar with the matter. Both assemblers began to mass produce smartphones for HTC this spring, the people said. Traditionally, HTC has produced all of its phones at its own factories.

The move accompanies other efforts by HTC to turn around its business. Chairwoman Cher Wang has taken a more active role in management in the past year, and the company recently hired Samsung Electronics Co.'s former U.S. marketing chief, Paul Golden, as a consultant to beef up its marketing.

HTC has long focused on high-end phones and resisted outsourcing, even as competitors from Apple Inc. to Nokia Corp. have turned to contract manufacturers to focus on design and save costs over the years. But as HTC struggles to hold its ground against Samsung and rapidly growing Chinese brands, it has decided to launch more low-price phones this year with the help of contract manufacturers.

Once the world's largest smartphone maker by shipments at its peak in 2011, HTC has contended with a stock slump of more than 86% amid unsuccessful marketing campaigns, supply-chain mishaps and growing competition. The mistakes brought HTC its second net loss on record in the first quarter, and it has fallen out of the world's top-10 smartphone makers since last year. The company's stock rose by the maximum daily limit of 6.9% on Monday to 169 New Taiwan dollars (US$5.59) on expectations that HTC would forecast a return to profit for the second quarter when it releases guidance on Tuesday.

HTC declined to comment.

Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in March that HTC was considering the possibility of using contract manufacturers, but that the company had no plans to outsource its flagship HTC One line or its key midprice phone, the Desire 816. The company's high-end phones are still its earnings drivers, said Yuanta Research analyst Dennis Chan.

MARKETS AT A GLANCE

(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)

SNAPSHOT

Upbeat U.S. services-sector data helped stocks finish with modest gains while pushing Treasurys mostly lower. The dollar was generally flat. Oil fell on disappointing data out of China, while gold rose on escalating tensions in Ukraine.

OPENING CALL

Australia is set to release trade balance data Tuesday. The country has been posting bigger-than-expected surpluses as new records are set in commodity exports. Chinese demand for metals is still surprisingly strong, and mines in Australia are coming online after massive capital investments in recent years, so there's supply to meet demand. The surge in exports is going to support the economy even as policymakers steer it away from its dependence on the resources sector. Also on tap Tuesday is a cash rate decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The cash rate has been on hold at a record-low 2.5% since August, and no change is expected in this latest go-round. Meanwhile, financial markets are closed for holidays in Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea.

EQUITIES

U.S. stocks edged higher, recovering from a morning slide, as investors weighed disappointing updates from two blue-chip stalwarts and digested a mixed bag of economic data from China and the U.S.

Trading volumes came in at the third lowest level of the year, which traders said contributed to volatility in stocks. Markets were closed for holidays in the U.K. and Japan.

The sideways trading comes as stocks have struggled to push higher this year, weighed by a slowdown in first-quarter earnings growth and uneven economic growth.

"We have pretty good expectations for the S&P 500 over the next year, but right now, there's no compelling reason to go either way," said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust, which manages about $1.1 billion. "What do you do from here? Do you sell? Do you buy? You just kind of hold," he said.

Mr. Braakman says he is largely sitting on his existing holdings and awaiting catalysts like better earnings news before placing any big bets either way.

Smaller-size stocks lagged behind the broader market.

Dow component Pfizer reported first-quarter earnings that topped analyst expectations, though its stock shed 2.6% as revenue fell short of estimates. Shares of J.P. Morgan Chase declined 2.5% after the banking giant revealed Friday it expects a 20% drop in trading revenue in its current quarter.

A weak reading on China's manufacturing sector disappointed investors. However, upbeat reading on the U.S. nonmanufacturing sector helped alleviate concerns. The ISM's nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index increased to 55.2 in April from 53.1 in March. That's beyond the 54.1 that forecasters had expected for last month, according a Wall Street Journal survey.

Elsewhere, Target fell 3.5% after the discount retailer said Gregg Steinhafel has stepped down as chief executive officer after six years in the role and 35 years with the company. He will be replaced on an interim basis by Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan.

Liberty Global shares rose 3.4% in afternoon trading after Phillippe Laffont, founder of hedge fund Coatue Management LLC, touted the stock at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York on Monday. He called the cable company an "awesome business" with an attractive price and strong leadership, saying shares could "easily go above $100."

Later this week, investors are expected to track Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress scheduled for Wednesday.

In Asian trading Monday, markets were mixed as China's Shanghai Composite erased early losses to close up less than 0.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped 1.3%.

FOREX

The Swedish krona tumbled against major currencies after a gauge for industrial production declined, dialing up the pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates.

"The market now is paying more attention to the indicators for Sweden," said Daniel Katzive, head of FX strategy for North America at BNP Paribas. "So now a weak number gets the market to move, as it means growing expectations that the Riksbank will act."

Also during the New York session, the dollar traded mostly flat against major currencies after a better-than-expected nonmanufacturing gauge showed the U.S. continues to emerge from its winter doldrums and grow slowly. This pulled the dollar back from early morning losses against the yen stemming from news of a worsening conflict in Ukraine and disappointing manufacturing data in China.

The euro and British pound held their levels against the greenback, while the yen inched higher.

Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen testifies on Capitol Hill later this week, which could provide direction for the dollar.

BONDS

Treasury bonds pulled back after an earlier rally sent the benchmark 10-year note's yield to the lowest level of the year.

Investors initially propped up bond prices, driven by disappointing manufacturing data out of China and concerns over Ukraine. But sellers dived in after the monthly index for the U.S. service sector rose to 55.2 last month from 53.1 in March, brightening the growth outlook for the world's largest economy.

Monday's U.S. data came on the heels of Friday's nonfarm payrolls that showed the U.S. economy added 288,000 jobs in April, the fastest pace of hiring in more than two years.

"The big picture is jobs are being created, not lost," said James Sarni, senior managing partner at Payden & Rygel in Los Angeles, which manages $85 billion. "It is hard for bond yields to trade at these low levels close to 2.5% given that the U.S. economy will continue to improve. I won't change my view on higher yields unless the U.S. economy falters."

Mr. Sarni said he is underweight Treasury bonds than and that yields at these levels make them even less attractive than higher-yielding corporate bonds.

COMMODITIES

Gold ended at a three-week high as the escalating conflict in Ukraine buoys investor interest in wealth preservation.

"Today is a clear pickup in tensions," said Bill O'Neill, principal with Logic Advisors. Still, while investors were again seeking the safety of gold, they showed "less enthusiasm" than during the earlier days of the Ukraine crisis, he said.

"It's one of those rallies that doesn't have a lot of oomph to it," Mr. O'Neill said.

Global crude-oil prices fell to a three-week low as traders looked past risks posed by the deteriorating situation in Ukraine to focus on weak economic data from major crude consumer China.

HSBC's manufacturing purchasing managers' index for China posted a reading of 48.1 for April, slightly improved from March's 48.0 but below the preliminary reading of 48.3. A reading below 50 indicates economic contraction, a bearish signal for oil demand because China is the world's second-largest crude consumer behind the U.S.

"The data in China was disappointing to say the least," said Phil Flynn, an account executive at wholesale brokerage Price Futures Group.

UPDATE 1-Google faces antitrust lawsuit on US mobile internet search

(Adds Google comments)

May 2 (Reuters) - Consumer rights law firm Hagens Berman said it filed a nationwide antitrust class-action lawsuit against Google Inc alleging the company "illegally monopolized" the Internet and mobile search market in the United States.

The lawsuit alleges that Google has expanded its monopoly of the internet search market by pre-loading its applications onto Android mobile devices through its Mobile Application Distribution Agreements.

According to the lawsuit, Google's role in placing this suite of apps, including Google Play and YouTube, has hampered the market and kept the price of devices made by competing manufactures like Samsung Electronics and HTC Corp artificially high.

Google said Android and Google can be used independent of each other.

"Anyone can use Android without Google and anyone can use Google without Android. Since Android's introduction, greater competition in smartphones has given consumers more choices at lower prices," Matt Kallman, a Google spokesman, told Reuters.

Steve Berman, the attorney representing consumers, alleged that Google had not achieved its monopoly by offering a better search engine, but through anti-competitive placement and market manipulation.

The case is in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, 5:14-cv-02007-HRL. (Reporting by Arnab Sen in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)

Business & Finance

China's financial system is about to be tested with $420 billion in trust products coming due this year. Worries are growing that many debt-laden firms don't have the cash to pay back investors.

Beijing is loosening some currency controls for multinational companies as it works to free up the movement of capital and reduce corporate costs.

The favorable effects of a weaker yen could soon taper off for large Japanese exporters. Honda expects changes in currency rates to cut its earnings by $655 million this fiscal year.

HTC's design chief will step down, as the Taiwan smartphone maker's market share shrinks and its reorganization continues.

The blistering rally in small-cap U.S. stocks late last year may have cooled, but many investors say the group still appears pricey.

Alibaba is considering adding new shares to its initial public offering, a plan that could make the deal the largest in history.

China Construction Bank's net profit increased 10% in the first quarter from a year earlier, but bad loans edged up.

NTT DoCoMo plans to sell its 26.5% stake in an Indian telecommunications joint venture, Tata Teleservices, by June.

Grand Twins International, a Taiwanese-owned garment maker, will raise less than it hoped for in an IPO in Cambodia.

Battles over position and power are upending the slated $35 billion "merger of equals" between ad firms Omnicom and Publicis.

A U.S. appeals court revived some Apple patent infringement claims against Motorola Mobility, but the ruling could deal a blow to a separate case the iPhone maker is pressing against Samsung.

World-Wide

The U.S. and other G-7 nations agreed to move quickly to impose new sanctions on Russia, after concluding the Kremlin isn't abiding by a deal intended to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine.

An American detained in North Korea declared he wasn't a tourist and tore up his visa upon arrival, the U.S.-based agency that organized the trip said it was told by guides who accompanied him.

Taiwan said it would stop construction at the island's fourth nuclear-power plant to assuage growing opposition to the use of nuclear energy on the island.

FOXCONN

Google Buys Several

Patents From Company

Foxconn, which assembles gadgets for companies such as Apple Inc., said it has sold a number of its communications technology patents to Google Inc. for an undisclosed sum.

Taiwan-based Foxconn, officially known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., made a name for itself in contract manufacturing by making Apple's iPhones and Sony's PlayStation game consoles. But few know the electronics manufacturer has been developing new technologies and has a sizable patent portfolio. In a statement, the company said it has applied for 128,400 patents and has been granted more than 64,300 patents world-wide.

In the highly competitive technology industry, companies are challenging each other to set industry standards, which has led to a few patent cases.

Foxconn said it would continue to invest in technology research and development, "transforming such investments into valuable intellectual-property assets." It declined to provide further details.

Google declined to provide comment.

HONDA

Auto Maker Expects Weak

Yen Benefits to Taper Off

If Honda Motor Co.'s outlook for this year is any indication, the favorable effects of a weaker yen could soon taper off for big Japanese exporters.

The maker of Accord and Civic cars said Friday that it expected the strengthening of the yen to reduce its earnings in the fiscal year ending next March by 67 billion yen ($655 million). In the fiscal year just ended, Honda reaped a 289 billion yen pretax windfall from the weak yen.

The company expects its net income to rise 3.6% this fiscal year. But that is a significant slowdown from the just-ended year, during which net income rose 56%, to 574 billion yen, the company said Friday.

In its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in March, Honda's net profit more than doubled to 171 billion yen, with sales growing to 3.1 trillion yen from 2.74 trillion yen.

The weaker yen, a pillar of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic-stimulus plan, helps exporters by increasing the value of foreign sales when converted into the Japanese currency. Honda said that last fiscal year the dollar averaged 100 yen, compared with 84 yen during the previous year.

PEARSON

Publisher Keeps Positive

Outlook With Higher Sales

Pearson PLC on Friday sounded an upbeat tone and reported a rise in first-quarter sales, as the U.K.-based publisher and education specialist prioritizes digital learning courses and expansion in emerging economies.

The company said sales in the first three months of the year, excluding those of book publisher Penguin Random House and corporate-news provider Mergermarket, rose 2% at constant exchange rates to GBP 900 million ($1.51 billion). Pearson owns 47% of its publishing joint venture with Bertelsmann SE & Co. Previously, it owned 100% of Penguin. Last November, it agreed to sell Mergermarket for GBP 382 million.

On a reported basis, sales fell 6% because of the strength of sterling against the U.S. dollar and emerging-market currencies.

The U.K.-based group, which said it was operating in line with expectations, didn't disclose profit figures.

News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, competes with Pearson's publishing, business-news and education divisions.

HTC

Design Chief Steps Down

From Smartphone Maker

HTC Corp.'s design chief will step down, as the Taiwanese smartphone maker's market share shrinks and its reorganization continues.

Scott Croyle was the key individual behind the company's latest flagship smartphone, the HTC One (M8), which has garnered favorable reviews for its sleek design since it was unveiled earlier this year.

Mr. Croyle will be focusing on "special projects" and "next-generation developments," HTC said in a statement Saturday.

A few years ago, HTC was the top seller of Android-powered smartphones.

But then it ran into marketing and operational problems. It fell out of the world's top-10 smartphone makers by volume last year, while competitors Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. -- as well as lower-cost Chinese rivals such as Lenovo Group Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. -- continued to gain ground.

HTC Chairwoman Cher Wang has taken a more active role in managing the company in an effort to reverse its slide.

To beef up its marketing efforts, the Taoyuan-based company also recently hired Samsung's former U.S. marketing chief, who helped create the successful Galaxy brand, as a consultant.

Mr. Croyle joined HTC in 2008 after One & Co., a San Francisco-based boutique design house he co-founded, was acquired by the Taiwanese company. He wasn't immediately available for comment.

RPT-CORRECTED-Apple's sales boom in communist Vietnam

(Repeats to more subscribers; corrects period for sales in first paragraph)

By Nguyen Phuong Linh

HANOI, April 24 (Reuters) - - Communist Vietnam is suddenly Apple Inc's hottest market after sales there tripled in its fiscal first half, a growth rate five times faster than in India where it is spending heavily in a battle for market share.

Vietnam has barely received a mention from Apple executives in their regular briefings for financial analysts. But in a quarterly conference call on Wednesday, they were talking up the potential of the country.

Quarterly iPhone sales more than doubled and the strong growth appears likely to continue given Vietnam's predominantly young, tech-savvy population, rapid growth in internet and mobile phone use and a projected doubling of the middle class by 2020.

Vietnamese tech firms are fast cropping up, churning out apps such as Flappy Bird, which rose from obscurity to become one of the world's most downloaded mobile games.

Young Vietnamese thronging stores to buy iPhones worth up to half of their country's 2012 gross per-capita income say it's worth it.

"This cost more than two months worth of my salary," said officer worker Pham My Linh, 23, moments after agreeing a payment plan for an iPhone 5. "But I need it, to feel more confident when hanging out with friends and colleagues."

The surge in demand comes against a backdrop of sluggish economic growth exacerbated by high levels of bad loans and business closures.

The economy grew 5.4 percent last year, a rate economists see as underwhelming given Vietnam's fast population growth and its retail and manufacturing potential.

But Vietnamese smartphone sellers say a hunger for higher social status is driving Apple's sales, helped by price cuts and payment plans that make it easier to digest handset prices that exceed the monthly income of most urbanites.

TRENDIER SMARTPHONES

The growing thirst for slick technology is not just benefiting Apple, but most firms offering tablets and smartphones, among them HTC and Samsung. Slower growth for standard mobile phones shows local appetite for upgrades to trendier handsets, industry experts say.

"I've seen no signs of an economic recession in this shop," said the manager of a Hanoi branch of FPT, Vietnam's biggest listed tech company. "People buy $1,000 items with ease and a family buying three iPads isn't uncommon."

According to data released in January by market research firm GfK, smartphones accounted for 77 percent of mobile sales in Vietnam last year and the number of units sold grew nearly 135 percent from a year earlier. Tablet sales soared 250 percent in 2013 as prices fell by close to 27 percent.

Many companies are looking closely at Vietnam, where 15 million people live in two main cities, only 30 million use the internet among a 90 million population and two thirds are under 30 years of age.

Apple isn't the only beneficiary of its own brand appeal.

Fake iPhones with a near-flawless appearance are on sale for just 2 million dong ($95).

"There are a lot of people out there who can't afford an iPhone but still want to look rich, which is why shops like mine can do well," said shop owner Nguyen Duc Hai, 33.

"Why pay 10 times more for a real iPhone just to build a luxury image and show off?"

HONG KONG¡XChina Mobile Ltd., the world's largest mobile carrier by subscribers, posted a 9.4% decline in first-quarter net profit Tuesday as intensifying competition and handset subsidies for Apple Inc.'s iPhones hurt its profitability.

China Mobile has long had a dominant share in the Chinese mobile market, with more than 770 million subscribers. But it is now under pressure from smaller rivals China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., which are offering high-speed data services at attractive prices.

Those rivals operate on mobile-technology platforms that are widely used globally, which gives them access to more popular and speedy third-generation smartphones. The two companies have sold iPhones for several years.

China Mobile, however, has been dependent on homegrown 3G technology, which is compatible with fewer handsets. To maintain its dominant position, the company plans to double its capital spending to $12 billion this year to build a speedier 4G network. Apple and other major smartphone makers including Samsung Electronics Co., Sony Corp. and HTC Corp. already make phones to support this 4G standard.

China Mobile added 1.34 million 4G users in February, of which about one million were new iPhone users, Chief Executive Li Yue told The Wall Street Journal last month. The company said Tuesday it added 1.45 million 4G users in March, but it didn't give a breakdown of iPhone users.

China Mobile's net profit for the three months ended March 31 fell to 25.24 billion yuan ($4.04 billion) from 27.88 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.8% to 154.83 billion yuan from 143.63 billion yuan a year earlier.

A new generation of smartphone applications that allow users to send free voice and text messages was a drain on the company's traditional mobile revenue, however, new mobile revenue from data and multimedia content services rose.

Analysts expect China Mobile's hefty investments in its mobile-network upgrades and higher handset subsidies to continue to weigh on its earnings. China Mobile started offering iPhones on its new 4G network in January and the company expects this addition to ratchet up the subsidies it dishes out for all models of phones by 31% this year.

The company's results contrast with the increase in first-quarter earnings reported by China Unicom, which continues to gain market share in the world's largest mobile market by subscribers.

The Chinese government has introduced measures to help smaller carriers including China Unicom and China Telecom, which reports earnings next week.

One such measure will allow China Unicom to benefit from lower interconnection fees that the company pays for calls to China Mobile's network, beginning this year. Analysts said the savings from the interconnection policy will help fund China Unicom's network upgrade and marketing efforts to further increase its mobile users this year.

China Mobile controlled 62% of the mobile market in China as of the end of February. China Unicom had a 23% market share and China Telecom had 15%.

Microsoft Corp. agreed to a patent licensing deal with communications provider Motorola Solutions Inc., granting world-wide coverage under its patent portfolio for Motorola Solutions's devices running the Android and Chrome OS operating system.

"Microsoft prefers licensing to litigation, since licensing is a more effective way to share technology and accelerate the pace of innovation," said Nick Psyhogeos, an associate general counsel of intellectual properties licensing at Microsoft.

Motorola, which recently agreed to sell its scanner business to Zebra Technologies Corp. for $3.5 billion, provides services to government and public-safety customers, offering communications systems for services such as police and fire departments.

Since Microsoft launched its intellectual property licensing program in 2003, the company has entered into more than 1,100 licensing agreements. The program was developed to provide access to Microsoft's research and development investments and patent and intellectual-property portfolio.

Microsoft's specific patent licensing program for Android device-makers has resulted in signed license agreements with companies including Samsung, ZTE, LG, HTC, Acer and Barnes & Noble.

HTC

Smartphone Maker Hires

Samsung Ex-Marketing Head

HTC Corp. is hoping to nab a bit of that Samsung shine, as it has hired the South Korean company's former U.S. marketing chief as a consultant.

An spokeswoman for HTC confirmed Friday that Paul Golden, who helped create Samsung Electronics Co.'s successful Galaxy brand, is now a consultant for Chairwoman Cher Wang. The confirmation followed a Bloomberg report on Mr. Golden's hiring.

The struggling Taiwanese smartphone maker has long admitted that marketing was its weak spot. Within the past few years, HTC has shuffled through three CMOs, and in recent months Ms. Wang has taken an active role in overseeing the company's marketing plans.

HTC's 2012 and 2013 marketing campaigns were all high concept -- one involved sky divers; the other, Robert Downey Jr. giving branding advice to the company -- but they failed to stem the company's slide in sales.

Golden was Samsung's U.S. CMO from 2008 to 2012. He wrote on his LinkedIn page that he created and launched Samsung's Galaxy brand, which helped propel the company's global smartphone market share to 21% from 4.5% during his tenure.

As for HTC, even a fraction of that market-share gain would be a success.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL

Supreme Court Won't Block

Ruling That Canceled Patent

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts refused Friday to block a lower-court ruling that invalidated Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.'s patent for the multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone while the Israeli drug maker pursues an appeal to the Supreme Court.

Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized tribunal that hears patent appeals, threw out Teva's patent, clearing a major hurdle for Sandoz, a unit of Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and other generic manufacturers to begin producing the drug.

Although best known for its own generic products, Teva, based in Petah Tikva, Israel, has several branded medicines as well. Earlier this month, the company reported that Copaxone sales rose 8% to $1.14 billion.

Last month, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Teva's appeal, with arguments expected after the justices begin their next term in October. After the Federal Circuit declined to stay its decision while the case is pending at the Supreme Court, Teva on April 4 asked Chief Justice Roberts, who oversees the Federal Circuit, to step in.

In a one-paragraph order, the chief justice said Teva wasn't entitled to such intervention.

Teva "has shown a fair prospect of success on the merits" of its appeal, he wrote. "I am not convinced, however, that it has shown a likelihood of irreparable harm from denial of a stay." If Teva ultimately prevails, he observed, it can recover damages from generic competitors found to infringe its patent.

"Given the availability of that remedy, the extraordinary relief that Teva seeks is unwarranted," Chief Justice Roberts wrote.

A Teva spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Smartphone makers, carriers embrace anti-theft initiative

NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - Major U.S. wireless carriers and smartphone makers have agreed to introduce tools to enable users to lock their devices and wipe them clean of data if stolen, responding to pressure on the telecommunications industry to do more to stem theft.

Starting in July 2015, all smartphones manufactured by the companies will come with free anti-theft tools preloaded on the devices or ready to be downloaded, according to wireless association CTIA, which announced the agreement on Tuesday.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and San Francisco District Attorney, George Gascon welcomed the voluntary agreement but said it fell short of what they have advocated to prevent theft.

The prosecutors have urged manufacturers and carriers to carry the tools as a default in their devices, rather than having users download them.

"While CTIA's decision to respond to our call for action by announcing a new voluntary commitment to make theft-deterrent features available on smartphones is a welcome step forward, it falls short of what is needed to effectively end the epidemic of smartphone theft," the prosecutors said in a joint statement.

In 2012, 1.6 million Americans were victimized for their smartphones, according to Schneiderman's office.

The 10 device makers signing the voluntary agreement included Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Google Inc and HTC America Inc. The wireless carriers included Verizon Communications Inc , AT&T Inc, Sprint Corp, T-Mobile US Inc and U.S. Cellular.

"This flexibility provides consumers with access to the best features and apps that fit their unique needs while protecting their smartphones and the valuable information they contain," said Steve Largent, chief executive of the CTIA.

The agreement extends individual decisions by Apple and Samsung to include features in their new mobile software that require a legitimate owner's ID and password before a phone can be wiped clean or re-activated after being remotely erased. (Reporting By Marina Lopes; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)

Samsung Leans on Google for Aid in Apple Suit; Google Executive Says His Firm Was Working on Features in Question Before iPhone Introduction

SAN JOSE, Calif.-¡XSamsung Electronics Co. opened its defense against Apple Inc.'s patent infringement charges by turning to Google Inc., which maintains it didn't copy anything from the iPhone in creating the Android operating system.

The sixth day of the high-stakes patent trial between the two technology giants featured testimony by Google Vice President Hiroshi Lockheimer, who oversees the engineering of the Android software used by Samsung and other smartphone makers. He said Google had been working on many of the software features in dispute in the trial before Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007.

"We like to have our own identity. We like to have our own ideas," said Mr. Lockheimer, who said Google started working on the mobile-phone operating system in 2005. He joined the team in April 2006.

Google's participation adds a new element to the long-running patent feud between Apple and Samsung. The Web search giant's free software has helped manufacturers develop smartphones with many features that resemble those associated with the iPhone. But Google has largely been a figure in the background; Apple hasn't sued the company, choosing instead to target hardware companies such as Samsung and HTC Corp. that sell Android-based phones.

Samsung lawyers tried to assert that Google created the features in question independently of Samsung. Apple has argued that Google isn't a defendant in the case and that it was Samsung who made the decision to copy the iPhone.

Google's testimony helps provide South Korea-based Samsung a Silicon Valley connection. Samsung needs to win over a jury listening to testimony in a federal courtroom just 10 miles south of Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. Jurors in a prior case brought in the same court ruled against Samsung.

This jury will determine whether Samsung infringed on software patents held by Apple, which is seeking damages of $2.2 billion. Samsung says that four of the five patents at issue in the case cover features that Google already had in the works.

Documents revealed earlier in the trial show the intensifying rivalry between Apple and Google with Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs declaring a "holy war" against Google in one email. However, patent experts said it is easier and potentially more lucrative for Apple to go after manufacturers in court than Google, because the Mountain View, Calif., company doesn't charge for Android.

Apple wrapped up its case earlier Friday with Christopher Vellturo, an economist and its damages expert, laying out the case for why it deserves the $2.2 billion damages award. By his analysis, Mr. Vellturo said the infringement had cost Apple $1.07 billion in "lost profits" and that it deserved an additional "reasonable royalty" of $1.12 billion.

Google's Mr. Lockheimer, in testimony that resembled how Apple's engineers described the long hours spent developing the iPhone, said Android was formed by a small team dedicating up to 80 hours a week for its creation. "We worked very hard and it was very start-up like," he testified.

The Google executive also recalled how manufacturers were surprised in early meetings about the search giant's intention to create a mobile operating system.

"They quickly realized that we weren't joking around," Mr. Lockheimer said.

Samsung's lawyers also sought to highlight that Google and Samsung, while partners, don't work together to roll out new software features. Mr. Lockheimer said there have been times when Samsung asked for specific changes to Android and Google refused.

Wi-Lan: Judge Rules Jury Improperly Invalidated Some of Its Patent Claims

Wi-Lan Inc. said a U.S. federal judge determined that an October jury verdict improperly invalidated some of the Canada-based patent-licensing company's claims in a dispute with Apple Inc.

Wi-Lan said in a statement Wednesday that the court was unable to find substantial supporting evidence for the jury's finding and as such the invalidity verdict can't stand. However, the judge denied other aspects of Wi-Lan's challenges to the verdict.

Wi-Lan had sued Apple, Alcatel-Lucent, Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., HTC Corp., Novatel Wireless Inc. and Sierra Wireless Inc. in September 2011, claiming patent infringement on certain technologies.

A jury ruled in favor of Apple in October. Wi-Lan previously settled with the other six defendants in the case.

An Apple spokesman couldn't immediately be reached to comment.

Wi-Lan President and Chief Executive Jim Skippen said the company "believed all along that the claims in our 802 patent were valid, and this decision just reaffirms that belief."

"We also believe that the judge's ruling will be of significant benefit to Wi-Lan with respect to any future appeals we may make to the U.S. federal courts concerning our ongoing intellectual property disputes with Apple," he added.

Cool Phones Don't Equal Hot Stocks

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Samsung and HTC are hoping for a fresh start from a new smartphone product cycle. But a hit phone won't make up for strategic weaknesses.

Both Asian companies provided weak first-quarter figures. Korean electronics giant Samsung said first-quarter operating profit likely declined, which would be the second year-over-year quarterly decline in a row. Taiwan-based smartphone maker HTC reported a net loss for the quarter as revenue continued a downtrend that began in 2011.

The two companies are hoping for a sales lift in the second quarter as both unveil new flagship phones. The latest HTC One made its debut on March 25, and Samsung's Galaxy S5 comes out April 11. The stakes are high for both.

Sales of Samsung's previous top-end phone, the S4, were a disappointment, triggering a sharp decline in Samsung shares since last summer. HTC predicts its new phone will help bring it back into the black in the second quarter.

Waiting for sales results leaves investors in a holding pattern, a predicament that illustrates a fundamental problem with smartphone makers.

Customer tastes are fickle and competition is intense, especially for companies relying on Google's Android platform, as Samsung and HTC do. They lack a software ecosystem to set themselves apart and keep customers loyal. Competition will heat up further as Lenovo storms into the Android market with its acquisition of Google's Motorola Mobility.

In this environment, marketing becomes key. HTC's previous flagship was adored by reviewers, but failed to catch on with customers, partly due to a lack of advertising firepower. Last year, HTC spent $875 million on marketing, compared with Samsung's $11.6 billion, though not all of Samsung's spending was on smartphones. Samsung now will try to limit marketing expenses this year, making it harder to boost sales.

Plus, Apple also is raising its marketing game as the iPhone maker struggles with slowing sales.

Another headwind is deteriorating margins, as the market for high-end phones becomes saturated and growth increasingly comes from emerging markets. Dozens of low-end smartphone makers in China and India use Android free. The average selling price for Samsung smartphones will likely fall to $273 this year from $318 in 2011, according to Bernstein Research.

Investors soon will have a good idea whether HTC and Samsung have hit phones on their hands. Even if they do, that will only boost earnings for few quarters, and then it is back to the races again with a new product cycle.

Securitization Is in Regulatory Doghouse

The power of central bankers' proclamations has never been greater: European Central Bank President Mario Draghi stopped the euro-zone crisis in its tracks with just 23 words in July 2012. But it will take more than words if Europe is to revive its securitization market. Regulators are still fighting the last crisis.

A clear push is on to bring securitization in from the cold and boost credit availability. The ECB's Yves Mersch has been a vocal supporter; at the Bank of England, Andy Haldane and Clara Furse also have been speaking out. The two institutions plan to present a joint paper on the topic for the International Monetary Fund's spring meetings this week. But while the securitization market is active, it is a pale shadow of its former self. Public issuance of bonds in 2013 was 76.4 billion euros ($105 billion), down 10% from 2012 and just 16% of the volume issued in 2006, data from the Association for Financial Markets in Europe show.

Strides have been made in improving the structures of securitization. There is greater transparency, and the complex structures that brought down the financial system are a thing of the past. A regulatory consensus is building around support for so-called high-quality securitizations: relatively simple structures with well-understood underlying assets that provide funding to the real economy, such as auto loans. Riskier structures such as collateralized debt obligations or commercial-mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, aren't in the high-quality bucket.

But regulation still looks punitive. Take Solvency II, the new rules that will govern insurers. Even with the lower capital charges proposed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in December for higher-quality structures, securitizations are at a disadvantage. For a triple-A prime U.K. residential mortgage-backed security, or RMBS, the charge is 4.8 times that for a triple-A corporate bond, and is even slightly higher than for double-B-rated junk bonds. Insurers will surely prefer to put their money in corporate bonds rather than securitizations. But insurers are vital in broadening the investor base for securitization beyond banks.

True, the track record for some forms of securitization is appalling. From mid-2007 to the end of the third quarter of 2013, 21.6% of U.S. RMBS defaulted, according to AFME. But the default rate for European RMBS is just 0.1%. For securitizations of loans to small and medium-size enterprises -- the hot topic for central bankers eager to get credit flowing to parts of the economy beyond their reach -- it is 0.4%, AFME says. This performance is impressive given the depth and severity of the euro-zone crisis.

The risk is that regulators are calibrating their rules based on data that fail to reflect the European experience; Mr. Mersch has notably likened this to setting the price of flood insurance in Madrid based on the experience of New Orleans.

The current regulatory proposals might have helped avoid the last crisis. But regulation needs to reflect securitization in its current incarnation, not the market's past sins.

Samsung, HTC Facing

Murky Future in Phones

Samsung and HTC are hoping for a fresh start from a new smartphone product cycle. But a hit phone won't make up for long-term strategic weaknesses.

Both Asian companies provided weak first-quarter figures. Korean electronics giant Samsung said first-quarter operating profit likely declined, which would be the second year-over-year quarterly decline in a row. Taiwan-based smartphone maker HTC reported a net loss for the quarter as revenue continued a downtrend that began in 2011.

The two companies are hoping for a sales lift in the second quarter as both unveil new flagship phones. The latest HTC One made its debut on March 25, and Samsung's Galaxy S5 comes out April 11. The stakes are high for both.

Sales of Samsung's previous top-end phone, the S4, were a disappointment, triggering a sharp decline in Samsung shares since last summer. HTC predicts its new phone will help bring it back into the black in the second quarter.

Waiting for sales results leaves investors in a holding pattern, a predicament that illustrates a fundamental problem with smartphone makers. Customer tastes are unpredictable and competition is intense, especially for companies that rely on Google's Android platform, as Samsung and HTC do. They lack a software ecosystem to set themselves apart and keep customers loyal. Competition will heat up further as Lenovo storms into the Android marketplace with its acquisition of Google's Motorola Mobility.

In this environment, marketing becomes key. HTC's previous flagship was adored by reviewers, but failed to catch on with customers, partly due to a lack of advertising firepower.

Stocks: Anything but Rationale

The stock market's recent drop might not have been so unsettling to investors but for one thing: The lack of a clear reason as to why it happened.

Stocks have hit a rough patch, with some of the previous highfliers getting hit the hardest. The 2% the S&P 500 has shed since last Wednesday has unnerved investors, but it isn't as eye-opening as the near 4% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. This is to say nothing of the 7% declines seen in Facebook, Michael Kors Holdings and Wynn Resorts.

Some perspective is needed, though. On the Richter scale of what the stock market has been through in recent years, the past week doesn't register very highly. The Nasdaq's historical volatility -- a measure of how wide its swings have been over the past 30 trading days -- shows that while it has been a bit shakier lately, it isn't even close to as jittery as it was through the summer of 2011.

Back then, the selling was driven by widespread fears that a weakening U.S. economy could tip back into recession.

In contrast, this month's selloff has come amid economic data that would normally be highly supportive for stocks.

Take, for example, the March employment report that came out last Friday. It showed a pickup in hiring, more people entering the labor force, and moderating wage gains. So it should have reassured investors that the economy is in good shape, while at the same time sending the message that the day when the Federal Reserve feels it needs to raise rates will be, if anything, more distant. Yet stocks tumbled.

The stocks that have fallen the most have generally been the ones that had been registering the most upward momentum over the past year; the faster they have risen, the bigger their fall, in other words. These include many new-era tech stocks like FireEye and Splunk that have got some investors worried that another bubble is brewing in Silicon Valley. Those stocks are certainly longer on promise than they are on earnings, with valuation multiples so far beyond rich as to be almost meaningless.

On one hand, this is reassuring: Investors are taking a breather after a breakneck dash. But it is also troubling. Usually there is some event that can be pointed to -- a bad economic report, a big earnings miss, a fight in Washington -- that explains why stocks have fallen. Share prices crumbling just because prices have reached a point that investors can no longer stomach them can signal real trouble. When the dot-com bubble began losing air in March 2000, for example, there was no compelling cause.

The market is nowhere near the heights of ridiculousness it reached back then, both in terms of average valuation multiples and initial public offerings. But like the relative valuations used to justify many popular stocks today, using such an extreme situation as your touchstone for investing isn't advisable.

Technology stocks are sending ripples through the market, but the real thrills are to be found in shipping.

Amid the hand-wringing about the technology sector's selloff, the Nasdaq is down less than 2% this year. Now consider the Baltic Dry Index, which tracks leasing rates paid for ships carrying dry-bulk cargoes such as iron ore. Having ended 2013 at 2,277, it then sank to 1,084 in just over a month, down more than 50%. By mid-March, it had soared by 49% to 1,621. Today, it is 1,186.

Feeling seasick? Probably not if you have dealt with this index for a while. In 2008, it soared above 11,000. Such enthusiasm spurred a shipbuilding boom, leaving far too much capacity. Even still, net capacity will expand by 5% this year, estimates J.P. Morgan Chase.

The push and pull of optimism and despair about the shipping glut will keep the Baltic Dry Index in rough seas for a while yet.

Citi Must Run

Harder to Meet

Return Target

It is cold comfort for Michael Corbat, but Citigroup's capital-return debacle provided one thing: a useful reminder of how sensitive banks remain to leverage, and constraints on its use.

The Citi chief suffered the indignity last month of having the bank's request to return about $7 billion in capital to shareholders rejected by the Federal Reserve. Investors' immediate anguish centered on its dividend staying at a penny a quarter and its share-buyback program at $1.2 billion.

Beyond this, targets set by Mr. Corbat will now be far more difficult to meet, particularly Citi's return on tangible common equity exceeding 10%. Expect all this to garner much attention when Citi reports first-quarter results next week.

Return on tangible equity is an important measure of profit and an indicator of Citi's ability to create or destroy value. It came in at 8.2% last year. To get above 10%, Citi now will have to run harder. Chances are it won't make the finish line on time. Speaking before the Fed's decision, Citi finance chief John Gerspach acknowledged the bank's targets included capital returns.

To see why, consider the boost Citi's return measure would get from paying out capital. Had the bank been able to return $7 billion this year and next, it theoretically would have had to increase profits by only 6% in each of those two years to hit its target.

Without additional capital returns, Citi could increase profits by 10% in each year and barely find its mark.

Clearing the bar, with profit growth staying at the same high pace, would depend on Citi getting approval to pay out additional capital next year. Should profit growth come in at just 5% annually, though, its return would be well short even with a $7 billion payout in 2015.

So the onus is on Citi to increase profits at a brisk pace and patch things up with the Fed. But those might be conflicting objectives.

Citi will need to meet, or possibly exceed, another one of Mr. Corbat's targets: boosting the bank's return on assets to between 0.9 and 1.1 percentage points by the end of 2015. It managed just 0.72 percentage point last year. Hitting the target will be no easy feat in the current superlow interest-rate environment. That could prompt Citi to reach uncomfortably for yield.

But this could draw greater scrutiny, and possibly concern, from the Fed. For Citi, even running faster just to stand still may not be an option.

Nigeria, not widely envied in economic circles, has managed a trick many other countries might like to pull off.

After a long effort aimed at better capturing economic activity, Nigeria said gross domestic product in 2013 was some 89% larger than previously thought.

Services now make up more than half of GDP, versus less than a third before. The Nollywood film industry alone has emerged to contribute 1.2% of GDP, Renaissance Capital says.

Debt is now a mere 11.6% of GDP, down from 22%, Fitch Ratings notes. On the downside, tax revenue, the current-account surplus and foreign direct investment as shares of GDP are all lower now.

Such financial wizardry isn't likely to make an immediate difference in the daily lives of Nigeria's people. But hard-pressed finance ministers elsewhere may wish their own statisticians could do what Nigeria's have done for their country.

Asian-Pacific Stocks
China Shares Rise; Japan Falls on Yen

Most Asian stock markets rose Tuesday, with China leading the region higher, while Japan was weighed down by a stronger yen and continued tech-stock weakness.

Technology companies across the region continued to face pressure from a selloff in the sector that started in the U.S. last week, as investors started to ditch high-tech and biotech stocks that have helped lead the market higher in recent weeks.

Asia's big technology names faced another session of selling. In Japan, Sony lost 1.4% and Sharp dropped 3.7%.

Samsung Electronics fell 0.2% in Seoul after it forecast an operating-profit decline for the second consecutive quarter. The company is just days away from rolling out its new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S5.

In Taiwan, phone maker HTC lost 2.5% after the company announced late Monday that it swung to a net loss in the first quarter amid increasing competition from smartphone rivals.

There were some signs of stability, as Tencent Holdings bounced back 1.6% in Hong Kong after the index heavyweight fell 11% over the previous four sessions.

Chinese stocks led the region higher, with mainland China resuming trade after a public holiday on Monday. Chinese companies in both Hong Kong and Shanghai were still buoyed by Beijing's recently announced stimulus measures, with the Shanghai Composite up 1.9% at 2098.28 and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index up 1.6% at 10321.82. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 1% to 22596.97.

Weak manufacturing numbers out of China have heightened concerns that Beijing might have to step in more and introduce additional supportive measures. The next economic data point will be March export numbers on Thursday, with economists expecting a 4.2% increase from a year earlier.

In Japan, the Nikkei was down 1.4% at 14606.88, unaffected by the Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat on monetary policy, as falling technology stocks and a stronger yen had a stronger impact on the market. The dollar was at 102.74 yen in late Asia, compared with 103.09 yen late Monday in New York.

Also in Japan, Takeda Pharmaceutical closed down 5.2% after a U.S. jury imposed a $6 billion charge on the company in a case involving allegations that it hid the cancer risks of its Actos diabetes drug.

Elsewhere, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell less than 0.1% to 5410.60, and South Korea's Kospi added 0.2% to 1993.03. India's markets were closed for a public holiday.
