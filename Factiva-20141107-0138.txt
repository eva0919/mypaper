GameStop¡¦s Holiday Pitch: More Layaway, Generous Financing; Electronics Retailer to Offer Expanded Layaway Offerings, Including Game Consoles

GameStop Corp. on Wednesday continued its push for holiday shoppers by unveiling expanded layaway offerings, including next-generation videogame consoles and tablets, along with more generous financing terms for holders of its store credit cards.

The latest moves come as the videogame and electronics retailer has been posting strong results buoyed by demand for new consoles from Sony, Microsoft Corp. and Nintendo.

For the holidays, the company is preparing to see high demand for new games for the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One and the Wii U, as well as from customers who are looking to trade in their old smartphones for cash to help buy the new Apple Inc. iPhone 6. GameStop refurbishes and sells used iPhones and other pre-owned electronics as it looks to become a bigger player in an industry that the company expects will grow by 20% to 25% annually over the next five years.

Last month, to prepare for the rush, GameStop said it would hire 25,000 seasonal workers this year, a 47% jump from last year.

In another change from last year, when the Microsoft and Sony consoles debuted, the retailer has made the PlayStation 4 available for layaway during the upcoming holiday season. It had previously made the console available for layaway in April.

The Xbox One, which was available for layaway in February, wasn¡¦t on the list of products the company announced Wednesday. However, a company representative confirmed that the device will become available for layaway in early November.

Two Samsung Galaxy 4 tablets will be available under the program, too, the company said, as will a variety of headsets and accessories that hadn¡¦t been available before. The company added that it will make more products available as the season progresses and items become available.

GameStop also said it is also offering a limited-time financing offer for holders of its PowerUP Rewards Pro credit card. Under the incentive, customers will be eligible to pay nothing in interest on purchases of $500 or more for six months, GameStop said.

Retailers have reinvigorated layaway programs in recent years as cost-conscious consumers trim back credit-card spending amid a slow economic recovery. Sears Holdings Corp.¡¦s Kmart chain recently triggered the beginning of its layaway season, as well.

UPDATE 1-Japan Display cuts forecast as sales of high-end Chinese smartphones disappoint

By Sophie Knight and Reiji Murai

TOKYO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Smartphone and tablet panel maker Japan Display Inc slashed its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday to a 10 billion yen ($93 million) net loss, citing lower-than-expected sales of high-end panels to Chinese handset makers.

Japan Display, which had previously estimated it would post a net profit of 26.8 billion yen, said Chinese smartphone makers had not adopted full high-definition displays as rapidly as it had expected, while delayed shipments to a large customer had depressed sales in the six months to Sept. 31.

Sources told Reuters in August that Apple Inc suppliers including Japan Display had suffered a setback due to a design glitch with the panel for the recently released iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, halting some production assembly operations.

The forecast cut is the latest bad news for Japan Display, whose share price scraped a new all-time low on Wednesday before the announcement. An earlier profit warning and disappointing results both last year and for the first quarter have cast doubts over the viability of its high-end panel business.

Japan Display, the result of a merger between the display units of Sony Corp, Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd, troubled investors by its reliance on a tablet market so sluggish that analysts say even Apple may struggle to turn it around if it announces new iPads as rumoured on Thursday.

A source close to Japan Display said the company's full-year forecast had also taken a hit after orders from a Japanese handset maker had come in lower than expected, while prices for mid-end panels for the Chinese market had sagged.

Japan Display said it would not pay a dividend for the second quarter ended September, which it had not previously set, and also cut its operating profit forecast for the year to March 31 to 6.5 billion yen from a previous forecast of 40 billion yen.

In a separate filing, the Japanese company said it would close its Fukaya plant in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, resulting in an extraordinary loss of around 7 billion yen in the second half of the financial year. It said it would move staff from the plant to other manufacturing facilities.

Japan Display's share price ended flat on Wednesday at 439 yen after hitting a low of 431 yen, a lifetime low and 52.1 percent below the offering price of 900 yen at its initial public offering in March. ($1=107.4100 Japanese yen) (Reporting by Sophie Knight; Editing by Ryan Woo)

TOKYO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Smartphone and tablet panel maker Japan Display Inc slashed its full-year net profit forecast on Wednesday to a loss of 10 billion yen ($93 million), citing delayed shipments to a major customer and lower-than-expected sales of high-end panels to Chinese handset makers.

Japan Display had initially forecast a net profit of 26.8 billion yen. The company, which supplies displays for Apple Inc's iPhones, also cut its operating profit forecast for the year to March 31 to 6.5 billion yen from a previous forecast of 40 billion yen.

Digital doctors: China sees tech cure for healthcare woes

HANGZHOU, China, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Liu Chunming almost died after a car crash in July in Taihe, a remote county in China's southeast Jiangxi province, but survived serious abdominal injuries thanks to specialist doctors who led his treatment from 1,000 kms (621 miles) away.

From a central "operations room" in the eastern city of Hangzhou, doctors diagnosed and directed treatment for the 48-year-old using live video feeds and software that shares patient scans and files to aid consultation.

Liu's case - one of a growing number of distance healthcare cases in China - reflects the rise in digital healthcare, or eHealth, to bridge the chasm between China's developed health services in large cities and its grassroots rural care.

And that's a multi-billion dollar opportunity for technology firms.

"I'm not sure what would have happened without the distance diagnosis technology," Liu said in a phone interview from his village of Xiakeng in Taihe. He has since recovered.

To be sure, technology - from electronic patient records to remote healthcare - is already widely used in developed markets such as the United States and Europe, but the sheer size and scale of China make this a huge opportunity for tech firms and a big challenge for doctors, who say China lags far behind.

China's healthcare management sector is growing at close to 40 percent a year and will hit $38 billion in the next five years, according to local consultancy Raisewin International.

Technology is playing a growing role as Beijing overhauls a healthcare management sector blighted by chaotic patient data, underfunded rural health centres, overburdened city hospitals and a nationwide shortage of doctors.

"Technologies like remote health fit China's current situation because we have a large country with a rural-urban gap and medical resources spread unequally," said Yan Jianhua, who oversees the remote healthcare programme at the state-run Hangzhou hospital unit that treated Liu.

Government-supported programmes are looking to leverage specialised software and communication equipment to get the most out of in-demand doctors and specialists at leading hospitals.

The Hangzhou operations room, where doctors work remotely with around 160 hospitals across China, is equipped by global tech brands including Cisco Systems, Dell and Sony Corp.

INVESTMENT DRIVE

China's digital healthcare makeover won't come cheap though. Experts predict a multi-billion dollar bill to bring in IT systems for patient records, develop patient-doctor interaction software and install national networks.

Private investors and big corporations are already pumping money into the sector, with investment in Chinese healthcare IT alone predicted to double to some 34 billion yuan ($5.6 billion) by 2017, according to analytics firm IDC.

"There's a lot of interest because of China's demographics and the helpful trends in the market. Everyone's trying to get in and take as much market share as they can," said Mark Gilbraith, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers China life sciences unit, adding the adoption of healthcare technology was being driven by China's use of smartphones, an ageing population and a boom in chronic diseases as wealth levels rise.

Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings led a $100 million round of funding into healthcare platform Guahao.com on Monday and last month took a stake in popular drug information platform DXY.com. E-commerce group Alibaba invested in healthcare data firm CITIC 21CN Co Ltd in January.

From a standing start just a couple of years ago, these kinds of digital applications have attracted millions of users as doctors, and patients, become increasingly tech savvy.

Doctors now spend close to 13 hours a week online, including interacting with peers and patients, up from 11 hours in 2012, according to a report from Kantar Health and DXY.com. Over 80 percent use mobile phones to go online, more than double the number two years ago.

Other international companies to get in to this market include IBM Corp, Microsoft Corp, BT Group and Siemens AG. Locally, China Mobile , Huawei Technology Co Ltd and ZTE Corp are competing, too.

"There is clear adoption of tele-health and mobile health in remote locations sprouting up across China," said Kendall Ho, an eHealth expert at the University of British Columbia, which is working on a project in southern China.

HEALTHCARE DIVIDE

China's healthcare system struggles with a dearth of doctors and a significant gap between the level of quality in urban and rural hospitals. Patients often travel hundreds of miles to see a specialist in one of the big city centres.

Low pay and an often volatile relationship between overworked doctors and frustrated patients has seen the number of medical professionals fall in the last decade, according to a Deutsche Bank report, leaving many of China's almost 25,000 hospitals short of doctors.

A lack of centralized information systems for patient data, uneven distribution of resources and issues over patient registration, booking appointments and payment have all created a space for technology, said Xu Ruixue, director of public affairs solutions at ZTE, a Chinese telecoms equipment maker. Beijing plans to establish electronic health records to cover three-quarters of the population by next year.

"Information technology has a key role to play in resolving these challenges," said Xu, adding ZTE is expanding its work in hospital information systems and remote healthcare.

Other firms are pushing forward trials including healthcare 'clouds' to store and share information, online hospitals for self-diagnosis, tele-health and mobile health apps.

This will all take time, and money.

An IT overhaul to Britain's National Health Service cost tens of billions of dollars and came under fire for inefficiencies. China's near 1.4 billion population dwarfs the UK's 64 million.

But Beijing is on-board and sees technology as a potential quick-fix for its healthcare woes, Jian told Reuters at the Zhejiang hospital's distance telemedicine centre.

"Our remote diagnosis programme is already part of the country's healthcare reform drive," he said. "China's health ministry and the state is a big advocate and support."

PREVIEW-Netflix movie push aims to freshen streaming content

LOS ANGELES, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc is on a mission to start closing the yawning gap between the theatrical debut of movies and their availability for online streaming, forcing Hollywood to rethink where to release new films.

With a sequel to martial-arts drama "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and four Adam Sandler movies, Netflix will have brand-new content for subscribers around the world. That instant access is much quicker than the typical 7-to-18 months Netflix must wait to stream new releases from Hollywood studios.

Netflix has said it believes new and exclusive movies will help it build on its base of 50 million global customers. The company will release its latest subscriber numbers in its quarterly report on Wednesday, when it is expected to face questions about the original movie strategy.

Sandler's films will go straight to Netflix in the nearly 50 countries where the company operates. The international rights are key because many movie rights are tied up by other providers in overseas territories.

Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible estimates Netflix will spend up to $40 million on production of each Sandler film. That cost would be similar to what Netflix pays to stream a single film from a Hollywood producer such as DreamWorks Animation months later, he said.

"The perk here is you don't have to wait nine months," said Wible. "You have something you have exclusive access to across the globe."

If it can convince more stars and directors to accept straight-to-streaming deals, Netflix could shake up movies as it did television. In the case of its original series like "House of Cards" and "Orange is the New Black," it has fueled binge viewing by releasing all episodes at once. Netflix also won the first major Emmy awards for a series delivered online.

With more original movie deals in the works for Netflix, Hollywood directors told Reuters they are weighing the pros and cons.

David Ayer, director of the coming World War II drama "Fury" starring Brad Pitt, said he "absolutely" could be lured by an online distributor for a future project.

"The screens we watch on are becoming handheld (and) portable," he said. "It's the future of the business."

Ayer said he was hopeful that an online platform would grant him the same artistic freedom that Sony Pictures did with "Fury." "That's what studios need to do in order to maintain access to the labor of love of a filmmaker," he said.

Others in Hollywood may resist going to Netflix first.

Ned Benson, a first-time writer and director, took an unconventional approach for his release of "The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby," creating three separate films called "Him," "Her" and "Them."

While it seemed logical to release the three installments via video on demand for binge viewing at home, Benson wanted the films shown in theaters first.

"I really still believe in the theatrical model and the movie-going experience, even though we live in this day and age where you can stream and do things online via Netflix or VOD," Benson said. "I feel like we still have that option later."

The plan to release "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend" on Netflix in all of its markets in August on the same day the movie appears in select IMAX theaters has also raised the hackles of some theater owners. Chains AMC Entertainment, Regal Entertainment Group and Cinemark Holdings Inc are refusing to show the film.

It remains to be seen whether such opposition will deter other filmmakers from playing ball with Netflix in the future. (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Additional reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; editing by Gunna Dickson)

Life and Style
From Ballet to Broadway and Beyond; In 1944, ¡¥On the Town¡¦ made stars of the show¡¦s backstage talent.

When ¡§On the Town¡¨ had its Broadway premiere in 1944, during the final months of World War II, it was at once retro and radical, quickly establishing itself as a milestone of American musical theater (and the basis for one of the all-time great Hollywood musical films five years later). The challenge for director John Rando, who is staging a revival of the musical that opens at New York¡¦s Lyric Theatre on Oct. 16, will be in finding what is current and what is timeless in a show so specific to a unique period in our collective history.

¡§On the Town¡¨ grew out of an idea by choreographer Jerome Robbins. At the time, ballet was generally regarded as highbrow, invariably concerned with gods and goddesses or with dying swans. Robbins¡¦s idea (inspired by a 1934 painting by Paul Cadmus) was to make ballet vital and topical by depicting three carousing sailors on shore leave in New York, boisterously competing with one another for the attention of girls in a saloon. That notion initially took shape as the ballet ¡§Fancy Free¡¨ (1944) the first of many collaborations between Robbins and composer Leonard Bernstein, who had made his conducting debut with the New York Philharmonic in November 1943.

Following its April opening at the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York, ¡§Fancy Free¡¨ was such a hit as a ballet that Robbins and Bernstein were approached to develop the idea into a full-scale Broadway show. Now the problem was how to combine Robbins¡¦s classically informed dance numbers with musical-comedy theatrics, and Bernstein knew the perfect kids to write the book and lyrics: his former roommate Adolph Green and Green¡¦s writing-and-performing partner Betty Comden, whose experience up to then consisted mainly of crafting original material for their nightclub act, The Revuers. Robbins was the only one of the four with any real Broadway experience¡Xthough as a dancer, not a dancemaker.

At first, Comden and Green couldn¡¦t believe they were being asked to write a show about servicemen on leave. That was already a much-overused trope of Hollywood movies such as ¡§Born to Dance¡¨ (1936) and ¡§Seven Days Leave¡¨ (1942). But they quickly got the point: ¡§On the Town¡¨ would draw its energy from the deliberately incongruous juxtaposition of the highbrow and the lowbrow. With Robbins¡¦s ballet sequences and the comedy¡Xboth visual and verbal¡Xof Comden and Green, the show was supposed to be a cross between George Balanchine and the Three Stooges.

¡§On the Town¡¨ was a sizable hit on Broadway, running for 462 performances. And it made stars of its backstage talent (Comden and Green were also on stage in prominent roles), doing the most to accelerate Bernstein¡¦s rise as a formidable force in American music. As his centennial approaches, it is clear that neither Bernstein¡¦s original classical music nor his purely instrumental jazz compositions are as overwhelmingly successful as his theater music. Bernstein, especially in his dance numbers, combined Prokofiev with Ellington¡Xlong, elegiac, sweeping, balletic lines that make knowing use of blue notes, saxophone solos and jazzy phrasing.

MGM immediately snapped up the rights to ¡§On the Town¡¨ and put Comden and Green under long-term contract. The resulting movie was a sensation and remains a classic to this day¡Xmarking Gene Kelly¡¦s directorial debut and one of Frank Sinatra¡¦s most memorable movie roles. Yet the 1949 film is less of a masterpiece than it might have been had producer Arthur Freed not dropped most of Bernstein¡¦s songs. Kelly¡¦s primary motivation as one of the film¡¦s stars was to dance to Bernstein¡¦s superlative ballet music; as a first-time director, he apparently didn¡¦t feel he had the clout to make the case for the rest of the original score. Neither did Comden and Green¡Xwho were importuned to write substitute songs with MGM stalwart Roger Edens¡Xand, remarkably, neither did Sinatra. Betty Comden later told me, in 1994, ¡§Frank said that the only reason he agreed to do the movie was so that he could sing ¡¥Lonely Town,¡¦¡¨ a number that never made it to the film. (Some of the new Comden-Green-Edens songs are good, although when I told Comden that her 1949 song ¡§Prehistoric Man¡¨ was even better than ¡§Carried Away,¡¨ the 1944 song it replaced, she stood up dramatically, pointed toward the doorway, and demanded that I leave her apartment immediately. I suspected that she was kidding, at least to a degree, primarily because we were actually in Adolph Green¡¦s apartment at the time.)

Thus the movie¡¦s best moments are Kelly¡¦s effervescent dances and the street-wise comedy that Comden and Green wrote for a game cast that also includes the brilliant dancers Vera Ellen and Ann Miller. But MGM missed out on such gemlike Bernstein ballads as ¡§Lucky to Be Me¡¨ and, especially, ¡§Some Other Time.¡¨ Many years later, Tony Bennett and Bill Evans would reveal to us the luminescent beauty of those two numbers, and Sinatra eventually recorded a definitive reading of ¡§Lonely Town.¡¨ These are some of the most beautiful songs ever written for the American theater.

More than beautiful, these tunes are enduring. In addition to being regularly listed as one of the classic Broadway shows, ¡§On the Town¡¨ is one of 16 whose books and lyrics are collected in the Library of America¡¦s new ¡§American Musicals¡¨ volumes. (Further, Sony has just reissued a 1963 London cast album featuring a young Elliott Gould as Chip.)

The MGM version cannot be considered a definitive document of ¡§On the Town,¡¨ and the 1971 and 1998 Broadway revivals of the show were both short-lived. It is hard to imagine that any subsequent team could recapture the brash energy that Robbins, Bernstein, Comden and Green brought to their own material in 1944¡Xan exact parallel to that of the three sailors who sought nothing less than to condense a lifetime¡¦s worth of living, loving and laughing into a single day. ¡§On The Town¡¨ is, more than anything, a product of its time, and now it is up to Mr. Rando to bring out the majesty of its music and dancing and to show contemporary theatergoers the work¡¦s transcendent magic.

Mr. Friedwald writes the weekly Jazz Scene column for the Journal.

Opinion
The Columbus Effect in Business; Pioneering is glorious, but later entrants are often the ones who see the true potential of discoveries.

Christopher Columbus will be feted in many places on Monday as an intrepid explorer, reviled in others as the spearhead of European colonization. But the Genoese ship captain who in 1492 sailed west to parts unknown might be best considered today for what he can tell us about ourselves. The man who successfully pioneered direct cross-Atlantic navigation also died dispossessed and embittered. In this respect Columbus represents a type, not an exception: failing pioneers.

Many scholars believe that pioneers are highly successful, have a high market share, and are long-term leaders of the markets they pioneer. Yet historical analysis shows that pioneers mostly fail, have a lower market share and rarely lead their industries. Long-term market leaders seldom are pioneers. Rather, they are ones who appreciate the discoveries of pioneers, envision the mass market and exploit it profitably.

But the myth lives on. Scholars talk of ¡§first-mover advantage¡¨ as though it were a law. Students come out of business school obsessed with being ¡§first to enter,¡¨ as though it were a pre-eminent strategy. Analysts admonish entrepreneurs to ¡§rush to market.¡¨ The mantra of consultants: ¡§Better to be first than to be better.¡¨

Really? Today¡¦s market leaders in many categories didn¡¦t pioneer those categories. Microsoft didn¡¦t pioneer personal-computer operating systems (QDOS came before) or word processing (WordStar and others came before). Amazon didn¡¦t pioneer online books stores (Books.com came before). Apple didn¡¦t pioneer mobile music, the smartphone, the tablet (Sony, BlackBerry and others came before). Google didn¡¦t pioneer Internet search (AltaVista, among others, came before). And Facebook didn¡¦t pioneer online social networks (Myspace came before).

Why do pioneers tend to fail in the long run? For the same reason that Christopher Columbus didn¡¦t flourish despite his initial success: Pioneers too often cling to their initial intuition, just as Columbus clung for too long to the notion he had reached India. Pioneers focus on the small initial market, failing to envision the vast mass market that they just opened up. Pioneers stick with the initial product even when the market demands relentless innovation. All the while, a surge of later entrants learns from mistakes of pioneers, envisions opportunities and rides on the explosion of new superior technologies.

For example, BlackBerry popularized smart phones with their nifty physical keyboard. But the company ultimately declined because it clung too long to a physical keyboard while consumers were rapidly adopting touch-screen smartphones. Even Thomas Edison fought a bitter losing battle to protect direct current against the then new technology of alternating current¡Xwhich ultimately became the standard.

Yet pioneering is a glorious term. So much so that those who capitalize on the breakthroughs of others often promote themselves as pioneers, basking in their self-anointed glory and feeding the myth of pioneering advantage. If these later entrants forget their humble roots, though, such self-promotion may lead to self-deception. In today¡¦s climate, millions of entrepreneurs the world over are crafting the innovations that can topple overconfident market leaders.

Mr. Tellis, a professor and director of the Center for Global Innovation at the University of Southern California¡¦s Marshall School of Business, is the author of ¡§Unrelenting Innovation: How to Create a Culture for Market Dominance¡¨ (Jossey-Bass, 2013).

21st Century Fox, Apollo Finalize Pact for TV Venture; Agreement Brings ¡§Big Brother,¡¨ ¡§The Biggest Loser¡¨ and ¡§American Idol¡¨ Under One Production Umbrella

21st Century Fox Inc. and private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC have formed a programming partnership that will combine three television production companies into one with the hopes of creating a global entertainment giant.

Under the terms of the joint venture, 21st Century Fox¡¦s Shine Group and Apollo¡¦s Endemol and Core Media will be merged. All three companies are primarily known for unscripted content. Core is a producer of Fox¡¦s ¡§American Idol.¡¨ Shine makes ¡§The Biggest Loser¡¨ for NBC. Endemol¡¦s shows include ¡§Big Brother,¡¨ which airs on CBS.

¡§The combination of these assets will create a leading global format business with a deep and diverse portfolio of products, enhanced distribution capabilities and world-class creative talent,¡¨ said 21st Century Fox President Chase Carey.

The terms of transaction weren¡¦t disclosed but the entity has been valued at more than $2 billion, people familiar with the companies said.

The deal, which had been in the works since spring, continues a trend of consolidation among unscripted production companies. U.K. broadcaster ITV PLC has been very active, acquiring an 80% stake of Leftfield Entertainment, whose shows include ¡§Pawn Stars, and a 61.5% piece of ¡§Duck Dynasty¡¨ producer Gurney Productions.

Last month, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. bought a 55% stake One Three Media, a joint-venture between ¡§Survivor¡¨ producer Mark Burnett and Hearst Corp.

More sales may be in the works. Tinopolis PLC, which has been a buyer is now said to be on the block. Earlier this year, Tinopolis acquired Magical Elves, which makes ¡§Top Chef¡¨ for Bravo. It also owns A. Smith & Co. Productions, producer of Fox¡¦s ¡§Hell¡¦s Kitchen.¡¨

Another motivating for 21st Century Fox may have been to keep pace with Time Warner Inc.¡¦s Warner Bros. and Sony Corp. both of which have been aggressive in expanding abroad through acquisitions of production companies.

Fox and Endemol will each own 50% of the venture, which has more than 600 scripted and nonscripted formats and have operations in more than 30 markets. Sophie Turner Laing, a former managing director of content at British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC, which Fox has a large ownership stake in, has been named chief executive of the as-yet-unnamed company.

As a result of the deal, several top executives from the individual companies will be leaving, including Shine Non-Executive Chairman Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of 21st Century Fox Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch. Until last year, 21st Century Fox was part of the same company as News Corp, the owner of The Wall Street Journal.

¡§As Shine enters this new chapter with new partners, it is the right time for me to take the final step back from the company I love,¡¨ Ms. Murdoch said in a written statement. Shine was founded by Ms. Murdoch in 2001 and sold in 2011 for $675 million.

Film Review: 'Fury'

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Some feats are unforgettable: We remember the Alamo, along with the 300 Spartans who died at Thermopylae. But a five-man American tank crew (actually, four men and a baby, to be more accurate) overwhelmed by a platoon of German soldiers? Not only did the standoff depicted in "Fury" never happen, but it will likely be long gone from moviegoers' memories six months from now, after Sony's marketing blows over and people go back to watching "Inglourious Basterds" - the other, better pulp World War II movie featuring Brad Pitt as a heavily scarred, slow-drawling Nazi hunter. With a disappointing domestic reception ahead, David Ayer's first big-studio foray as director will rely on a strong showing overseas, where its fantasy of American exceptionalism will seem all the more egregious.

Until now, writer-director Ayer has largely focused his attention on gritty LAPD dramas, Tasering the genre back to life with such tell-it-like-it-is pics as "Training Day" and "End of Watch." Set during the waning days of World War II, as the Allies advance on Berlin and the Nazis put up vicious resistance on their home turf, "Fury" shifts the director's focus to military history. As such, the project marks a massive step forward in both ambition and scale for Ayer, but also brings disappointment. Though colorfully embellished with authentic detail and logistically complex to bring to the screen, Ayer's script is bland at the most basic story level, undermined by cardboard characterizations and a stirring yet transparently silly climactic showdown.

Even so, the film benefits from the scribe's usual research-based approach to capturing the tight, honor-bound dynamic of serving on the front lines, enriched by his ear for precise (and period-appropriate) technical patter. The pressure-cooker atmosphere is enhanced by the fact that Pitt's character, Sgt. Don Collier (a diluted version of his Lt. Aldo Raine from "Basterds"), and his men are sardined into a Sherman tank in which they've been serving side by side since North Africa. They all have nicknames (Collier's is "Wardaddy"), as does the tank itself: "FURY," menacingly painted in all caps on its 76mm cannon barrel.

It's a marvel of military service how men who might despise one another in civilian life can become like brothers in the field, and here, we get a sense of both the off-color squabbling and the deep-rooted camaraderie among these virtual siblings. Wardaddy's team includes the Scripture-quoting "Bible" (Shia LaBeouf), Latino driver "Gordo" (Michael Pena, affecting an early-century Mexican accent) and barely evolved swamp-rat mechanic "Coon-Ass" (Jon Bernthal). Ayer introduces the team from within the tight confines of their tank, a space that doesn't yield many good angles, but allows for some nifty lighting tricks. D.p. Roman Vasyanov's favorite is clearly to frame just the actors' eyes through the narrow slits of the tank's armor.

These guys look and sound like they've been to hell and back (even pretty-boy LaBeouf, who appears with his face scruffy and teeth blacked out for the role). But don't let the constant stream of personal, off-color insults fool you. Their views may differ, but they can agree on one thing: "Best job I ever had!" they exclaim, and Ayer clearly believes it. That's not necessarily the case for baby-faced newcomer Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), a clean-shaven, wet-behind-the-ears Army typist assigned to join them at the outset - more for reasons of dramatic convenience than practical necessity.

Norman serves as the audience's proxy, allowing Ayer to show us the ropes as the kid is forced into a situation more intense than he's ready to handle: Norman retches after discovering the scalp of a German soldier while scrubbing the blood from his seat in the tank. As war-movie cliches go, the onscreen spew is off-putting yet effective (Tom Hanks did it when he landed on Normandy Beach in "Saving Private Ryan"), the tough-guy equivalent of watching a neophyte take his first smoke onscreen. The poster boy for S.L.A. Marshall's infamous statistic, estimated in his book "Men Against Fire," that 75% of American troops in World War II never pulled the trigger for the purpose of killing, Norman has serious reservations about handling the machine gun he's assigned. But he grows up fast as tough-love Wardaddy treats the kid like his own "war son."

It's either that or risk letting the incompetent new team member get everyone in the crew killed, which is just the over-simplistic dynamic Ayer exploits for the remainder of the film. There's even a poignant if somewhat protracted interlude featuring "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days" star Anamaria Marinca and younger beauty Alicia von Rittberg ("Barbara"), in which Pitt's character enables the incredulous Norman to lose his virginity: "She's a good, clean girl. If you don't take her in that bedroom, I will."

It was cigar-chomping World War II vet Samuel Fuller who practiced the philosophy that the first shot and last shot of each of his films was the most important. The same could be true of "Fury," which opens and closes with corpse-strewn battlefields, which bookend the film with haunting evidence of the aftermath of war. Generally speaking, "Fury" looks less like recent war movies - with their modern, handheld camerawork and overall emphasis on immersion - than the more classically framed studio pics of an earlier era, where careful attention has been paid to meticulous compositions. The same goes for Steven Price's score, which offers variations on a single three-note motif, poignant when appropriate, but also easily expandable into a full-blown military theme as needed.

Though it's the action scenes that thrill, Ayer makes a point of balancing them with the quiet stretches between skirmishes, acknowledging that boredom - punctuated by a certain giddy tension - characterized much of the time soldiers spent at war. One could seldom anticipate when or where the enemy might strike, but when they did, the transformation from safety to survival mode was instant and entire. That makes for several heart-clutching sequences, including one that narrows Wardaddy's tank column down to just one as they face off against a superior German Tiger tank, using the Fury's speed and agility to defeat their armor-piercing rival. (The production shot with actual Sherman and Tiger tanks from World War II, along with a reconstructed interior whose removable walls did little to diminish the claustrophobia of the tight space.)

In another standoff, the tank column advances on a treeline at dusk. The scene looks like something out of "Star Wars" as the opposing sides exchange what looks like green and red laser fire, though the appearance and sound are both true to Ayer's research: The glowing bullet trails are tracers, which allowed gunners to see where they were shooting - or not, in the case of the trigger-shy Norman.

As in "End of Watch" (in which one character miraculously recovers from a near-fatal shooting), Ayer allows himself to play God here, deciding the fates of his characters for emotional and dramatic impact, even if none should logically survive the assault. Would a team of five men with a half-disabled tank really dig in their heels and fight a platoon of Germans nearly 300 strong? This choice is the most "Hollywood" element in a film that is constantly shifting between disturbing, realistic details (a burning man who shoots himself to escape the pain, or the German "cowards" hanged by the SS from street poles) and the stilted, sometimes even hammy liberties needed to make its point.

Ayer's seemingly contradictory approach can be heard in nearly every line: On one hand, he goes out of his way to capture authentic-sounding slang, encouraging the actors to use accents that aren't always intelligible amid the hyper-attuned (and occasionally deafening) sound mix. On the other, there can be no mistake that this is dialogue, not natural speech, for they express themselves in terse, trailer-quotable soundbites that tend to remind us that we're dealing with a collection of stereotypes, of which Bernthal's redneck is the least convincing, though none ever seems more than skin-deep. If their sacrifice is meant to be memorable, we must first believe them to be men: Ironically, it's the baby of the group, Norman, who emerges "Fury's" most full-fledged character.

Pay TV¡¦s New Worry: ¡¥Shaving¡¦ the Cord; A Growing Share of Subscribers Are Choosing Skinnier Bundles of Channels

The biggest U.S. cable-TV channels are experiencing a troubling trend: Their reach into American households is shrinking.

Over the past four years, the top 40 most widely distributed channels in 2010¡Xhousehold names like CNN, ESPN and USA¡Xhave lost an average of 3.2 million subscribers, or more than 3% of their distribution, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from measurement firm Nielsen.

Some in the industry point to consumers who are ¡§cutting the cord,¡¨ ditching their cable and satellite-TV connections in favor of more affordable online video options like Netflix and Hulu. But the numbers don¡¦t add up. Last year the pay-TV industry lost 166,000 subscribers, according to research firm MoffettNathanson LLC. While that was the first annual decline on record, it isn¡¦t enough to account for the subscriber declines of the biggest cable channels.

Indeed, the data and interviews with a range of cable-TV industry executives suggest that something else is going on: Many consumers aren¡¦t so much cutting the cord as shaving it.

A growing share of pay-TV customers are signing up for smaller, cheaper bundles of channels that cost anywhere from $10 to $50 a month and don¡¦t include popular channels like TNT, USA, ESPN, CNN, Fox News, Disney Channel and Discovery Channel, the industry executives say.

¡§What we are seeing is some cord cutting and some cord shaving,¡¨ said Stephen Hasker, global president of Nielsen. ¡§Consumer time and attention is shifting.¡¨

Basic plans that include little more than local broadcast stations now make up some 12% of pay-TV subscriptions, up from 8% to 10% a few years ago, according to estimates by some industry executives. Some consumers are also turning to cheaper, sports-free and family-oriented packages, executives say.

¡§We think cord-shaving is a reality going forward,¡¨ says AT&T Inc.¡¦s Chief Strategy Officer John Stankey.

The shift of consumers to lower-priced plans is a worrying sign for media companies, striking at the heart of how they make money. TV channels are paid by cable and satellite-TV providers on a per-subscriber basis. Over time, declines in subscribers could dent these companies¡¦ growth. Pay-TV providers face significant risks, too. If more people downgrade to skinny tiers, it could pressure revenue, analysts say.

Some media executives say losing a few million subscribers to their channels doesn¡¦t immediately raise alarms. They point out that they have been able to raise the fees they charge pay-TV operators for each subscriber more than enough to offset the declines. Media companies are also optimistic about selling their channels to new Web-based TV services from companies like Sony Corp.

But others are doing some soul searching over how and why this happened. Some executives say media companies have been so eager to make content available to streaming-video companies like Netflix Inc.¡Xwhich pays a lot of money for those rights¡Xthat they have actually undermined the pay-TV ecosystem, encouraging consumers to think they can find good programming for cheap online.

¡§We¡¦re at a tipping point of consumers thinking Internet first and TV second,¡¨ says Bryan Rader, CEO of Bandwidth Consulting LLC, a firm that advises investors about pay-TV marketing trends.

The precise number of people moving to skinnier bundles of channels is murky, since cable-TV providers closely guard that data. Media companies, meanwhile, don¡¦t disclose the distribution of their TV channels, and some of them contest Nielsen¡¦s estimates, arguing that changes in the media measurement specialist¡¦s methodology are to blame.

But data points are piling up to show ¡§cord shaving¡¨ is for real. At least two pay-TV providers say about 10% of gross TV subscriber additions are customers who are taking a slimmed-down bundle¡Xin contrast to the bigger ones with hundreds of channels that can cost upward of $100 a month.

Most of the biggest channels have lost between three million and five million subscribers since 2010. The two most expensive channels, which feature marquee sports events¡XWalt Disney Co.¡¦s ESPN and Time Warner Inc.¡¦s TNT¡Xhave been the hardest hit, with subscriber drops of nearly 5%. ESPN this year is expected to receive average monthly fees of $6.04 per subscriber, while TNT will receive $1.44, according to SNL Kagan.

ESPN, touting its ¡§35-year history of innovation,¡¨ responded that ¡§the demand for live sports will only continue to grow.¡¨

There are some limits on how far cord-shaving can go. Big channels like ESPN stipulate in their contracts with distributors that they need to be in the most widely distributed tiers or reach a high percentage of the customer base. That means if too many people start subscribing to cheaper tiers¡XISI Group LLC analyst Vijay Jayant says the threshold is between 10% to 20% of the total base¡Xproviders may have to start bringing the big channels into those bundles and they won¡¦t be as skinny.

Skinny TV packages have technically been available for years, but operators barely marketed them. A 1992 law stipulated that cable-TV providers must offer ¡§basic¡¨ tiers, consisting of a handful of local broadcast stations and public programming. A mid-2000s push by regulators led to family-oriented tiers, but pay-TV providers didn¡¦t market those packages broadly either.

Operators¡¦ thinking has changed. Attracting cost-conscious consumers and the growing pool of people who have never had a cable subscription and mainly consume online video¡Xso called ¡§cord nevers¡¨¡Xis now part of their growth strategy. The hope is that they can hook those consumers into pay-TV with the skinny plans and encourage them over time to upgrade to more expensive bundles.

Comcast Corp. last year began marketing a basic tier paired with high-speed Internet and HBO for a promotional price of roughly $50 a month, although it can vary by market. AT&T recently launched a similar offer that also comes with a year¡¦s free subscription to Amazon.com Inc.¡¦s Prime streaming video and shipping service. Meanwhile Verizon FiOS and DirecTV have put more marketing muscle behind slimmed-down TV bundles.

Some TV executives say that their internal numbers show shallower declines in their channels¡¦ reach than Nielsen¡¦s data does. A big issue, they say, stems from Nielsen¡¦s decision last year to include broadband-only homes in the panel of consumers it samples to gather industry data. Nielsen warned the change could affect each channel¡¦s household reach estimate by about 1.2%.

But the drop-off in major channels¡¦ reach has been going on since 2010¡Xlong before the Nielsen readjustment. Most network executives said that even if their internal numbers didn¡¦t match Nielsen¡¦s exactly, the direction was the same¡Xa steady subscriber decline that is expected to continue.

Nielsen says the subscriber declines are a real phenomenon.

Cord-shaving may be the biggest near-term threat. But the industry¡¦s bigger long-term risk is that consumers will get so fed up with rising cable prices that more will cut the cord entirely.

Craig Moffett, MoffettNathanson analyst, said ¡§investors have gotten complacent and started to believe that cord cutting isn¡¦t a real risk¡Kprecisely at the time that the forces of cord cutting are starting to gather more momentum.¡¨

Apple Inc. suppliers have pushed back plans to mass produce a larger-screen tablet to early next year, people familiar with the matter said, as they struggle to make enough new iPhones to meet strong demand.

Suppliers of the Cupertino, Calif., company had originally planned to produce the larger iPad in mass volume beginning in December, the people said.

¡§The top priority for the supply chain is to meet the overwhelming demand for the larger screen iPhones. The output of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus remains unsatisfactory,¡¨ said a person at a supplier. ¡§It would be challenging for display makers to split resources and spend a few months to ramp up production for a new larger screen iPad now.¡¨

Foxconn Technology Co., a major assembler of Apple¡¦s iPhones and iPads, is also facing the challenge of hiring enough factory workers to assemble the two new iPhones at its largest production site in Zhengzhou, in northern China. At the plant, more than 200,000 workers are dedicated to just making the new iPhones and key components such as metal casings. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is the world¡¦s largest contract manufacturer by revenue and has more than 1 million workers in China assembling electronics for companies including Apple, Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.

¡§Everyone is busy with the new iPhones, Foxconn¡¦s bread and butter. Chairman [Terry Gou] has also gone to the Zhengzhou site to monitor the production closely,¡¨ said an official at Foxconn.

Apple said it sold more than 10 million of its new iPhones in its first weekend of availability. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus went on sale in 10 countries on Sept. 19. Apple has expanded to other countries in recent weeks and is expected to start sales of the new handsets in China on Oct. 17. The company is expected to give an update on iPhone sales when it reports results for the quarter ended September, on Oct. 20.

Suppliers in Asia say Apple¡¦s larger tablet will likely have a 12.9-inch liquid-crystal-display screen with resolution that is similar to the current 9.7-inch iPad Air unveiled in October last year.

Apple said on Wednesday it was hosting a media event on Oct. 16. While the media invite didn¡¦t say what will be discussed, it is expected that Apple will unveil new iPads and iMacs. It remains unclear if the company will unveil plans for the larger iPad at the event and Apple declined to comment.

Apple¡¦s plans for a larger iPad come as the company¡¦s tablet business is showing signs of slowing. Unit sales of iPads have fallen for two straight quarters, while revenue from tablets has fallen on a year-to-year basis for four of the past five quarters.

It would be the first time Apple unveils a bigger screen iPad, following its move to launch bigger-screen iPhones last month to counter competition from rivals like Samsung Electronics Co. which popularized the big-screen mobile devices. As early as last year, Apple was testing larger screens for its smartphones and tablets.

Apple introduced a smaller iPad¡Xthe 7.9-inch iPad Mini¡Xin late 2012 as it tried to offer different sizes to compete in the tablet market.

Data from research firm IDC shows Apple¡¦s share of the global tablet market has slipped to 26.9% in the second quarter from 33% a year earlier. Samsung¡¦s share of the tablet market also fell to 17.2% from 18.8% as both companies have been facing rising competition from other Chinese vendors including Lenovo Group Ltd.

Apple has continued to expand its customer base with new products and refinements of current ones.

Suppliers are also preparing for mass production of a 12-inch MacBook Air in December, featuring a higher resolution display, people familiar with the matter said. The current MacBook Air comes in two different sizes: 11-inch and 13-inch models.

Amid a technological sea change from desktop computers to mobile devices, Apple aims to position the iPad as the computing product for a new generation of workers. In July, Apple struck a partnership with International Business Machines Corp. to develop applications targeted at different industries. Under the partnership, IBM also plans to sell iPhones and iPads to its corporate clients.

¡§If Apple were to launch a larger iPad, it would need to make better use of the screen real estate. Introducing better multitasking capabilities would certainly drive interest,¡¨ said Tim Coulling, analyst at Canalys.

Foxconn Workers Walk Off Job at Chinese Plant; About 1,000 Employees Went on Strike for Several Hours This Week

About 1,000 workers at a Foxconn Technology Co. plant in southwest China assembling printers and computers for companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. went on strike for several hours this week demanding higher pay.

The Taiwan-based company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., said the workers walked off the job for four hours Wednesday at its production site in Chongqing. About 20 workers went on strike Thursday morning, but further details on that stoppage weren¡¦t available.

Foxconn is working with its labor union and workers to resolve the dispute, the company said Thursday in a statement. The company said the strikes didn¡¦t disrupt production.

Management ¡§continuously increased production volumes, and even required individual workers to take on tasks that used to require two workers to handle. The increase in workload wasn¡¦t compensated,¡¨ said one worker who declined to be named. He said he participated in the strike.

¡§Some workers are not happy because the company [Foxconn] has reduced overtime hours, a key component of their salaries,¡¨ after H-P cut orders, said a Foxconn official who declined to be named. Workers also demanded the resignation of the factory manager, he said. Also, the company had tried to lay off some workers without paying severance, the official added.

Foxconn filed a complaint with the local police, he said. The reason for the complaint wasn¡¦t clear.

On the Weibo social-media service, users distributed images that appeared show hundreds of workers gathered outside the Chongqing facility Wednesday, waving protest banners as police officers looked on. The police presence at the factory continued Thursday, according to the worker.

A Chongqing police spokeswoman, however, said she wasn¡¦t aware of the strike.

Foxconn employs about 30,000 workers at its Chongqing site. The company has more than one million workers in China and is a major supplier to Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp.

The strike came after H-P said earlier this month it planned to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations as it faces intensifying competition from China¡¦s Lenovo Group Ltd.

¡§H-P continuously works to optimize its supply chain in order to maximize production and meet continued customer demand,¡¨ H-P said in a statement. ¡§At times this results in the movement of product lines between supplier factories. When these decisions are made, we work closely with the supplier so they can plan accordingly to minimize the impact to the workers.¡¨

Amazon in Talks to Join Digital Locker for Movies; E-Commerce Giant Might Come on Board With Studios¡¦ Cloud-Access System

Amazon.com Inc. is in talks with at least three studios to join the Ultraviolet digital-movie ¡§locker¡¨ consortium, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. Such a deal could jump-start Hollywood¡¦s effort to expand the $2 billion-plus online movie-sales business and make Amazon a bigger threat to market leader Apple Inc.

Ultraviolet allows people who buy movies from any participating digital retailer, or who redeem a code from a Blu-ray disc, to access an entire library from most Internet-connected devices.

Currently, people who purchase a digital movie from Amazon can watch it only via an Amazon app, while movies they buy from Apple¡¦s iTunes Store are listed separately in that app.

Backers of Ultraviolet have claimed digital movies will be more appealing to consumers when they have a single online collection, or locker, much like a shelf of DVDs bought from different stores.

Amazon, which is No. 2 behind Apple in digital movie sales and rentals, is in talks with Time Warner Inc.¡¦s Warner Bros., Sony Corp.¡¦s Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Comcast Corp.¡¦s Universal Pictures to implement Ultraviolet, the knowledgeable people said.

The total market for digital movie sales and rentals in the U.S. is projected to grow 25% to $2.3 billion this year, according to research firm IHS. Helping drive that growth, studios have begun selling most movies for several weeks online before they become available on DVD.

Ultraviolet is backed by every Hollywood studio except Walt Disney Co. The online movie services participating so far are all relatively small players, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.¡¦s Vudu, Target Corp.¡¦s Target Ticket and CinemaNow, formerly owned by Best Buy Co.

Notable holdouts have included Apple, Microsoft Corp. and¡Xuntil now¡XAmazon.

Ultraviolet is viewed by the studios, in part, as a way to prevent Apple from gaining too much power over the sale of movies online, by banding together smaller competitors. Apple¡¦s market share in online movie sales and rentals last year was 58%, said IHS, down from 75% in 2008.

An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.

Ultraviolet has grown more slowly than its backers had hoped when it launched four year ago, due to the paucity of big retail participants, as well as early technical snafus. To date, the service has amassed close to 20 million registered accounts, each with about five movies, according to a spokeswoman.

Amazon¡¦s participation could boost those numbers. With a market share of 15%, it is bigger than all of the digital retailers currently participating in Ultraviolet combined, according to IHS.

In addition to its strong position in digital movie downloads, Amazon is among the top three sellers of DVDs and Blu-ray discs for Hollywood studios, behind Wal-Mart and close to Target, according to studio executives. If it joins Ultraviolet, Amazon could enable anyone who buys a movie disc from it to automatically get a digital copy at the same time, without having to redeem a code. The retailer already does something similar for music, giving customers free online versions of albums they have bought on CD.

Blu-rays from most studios come with a code that allows people to get an Ultraviolet digital copy of the movie if they enter it online.

Talks with the three studios have been ongoing for several months, a knowledgeable person said. Technical questions involving how Amazon¡¦s digital locker would connect to other participating retailers have been a sticking point. Amazon wants to have several Hollywood studios signed up before launching with Ultraviolet, the person said.

Several other prominent digital movie retailers have kept their distance from Ultraviolet. Most notable is Comcast Corp., which started selling movies to its cable customers late last year and has already become a strong competitor, according to studio executives. Despite owning Universal Pictures, one of the studios that back Ultraviolet, the cable company keeps movies it sells within its own silo of set-top boxes and apps.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Sony Pictures Animation's forecast is looking bright, as it and family entertainment outlet DHX Media have inked a deal to adapt the film franchise "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" into a children's series.

Under the deal, DHX Media ("Yo Gabba Gabba!," "Degrassi") will develop and produce 26 22-minute, traditionally animated small-screen episodes of the computer-generated animated feature films. The deal also includes global television and non-U.S. home entertainment exploitation rights to "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs: The Series," with the companies also planning to approach U.S. broadcasters and digital channels with the pitch. The deal also has DHX Media representing merchandising for the television series on a worldwide basis.

"'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' has a tremendous legacy as beloved children's books and a duo of highly popular feature films, showing how great ideas can succeed across media," said Steven DeNure, president and COO of DHX Media. "We believe audiences both old and new are going to love this fiercely funny franchise reimagined for the small screen."

The "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs" films are based on the 1978 childrens book penned by Judi Barrett and illustrated by Ron Barrett and focus on Flint Lockwood, a high school tween who dreams of being a scientist while living in a blue-collar town called Swallow Falls whose primary industry is sardines. Other characters include Sam Sparks, the new girl in school and an aspiring journalist, and Flint's dad, Tim. There's also Steve the Monkey, Manny the head of the school's audiovisual system, school gym teacher (and eventual cop) Earl, baby clothing model Brent, and Mayor Shelbourne, who wins every election on the pro-sardine platform. The first film, which was released in 2009, had a domestic gross of $124,870,275. The 2013 sequel grossed $119,793,567 domestically.

Sony Pictures Digital Productions prexy Bob Osher said he is "thrilled to see the adventures of our beloved characters from 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' further expanded to television for audiences around the world to enjoy" and Rick Mischel, executive producer at Sony Pictures Animation, added that "DHX's track record in creating great kids' television content makes them an ideal partner to capture the unique humor and tone of Flint Lockwood and his friends that made the theatrical franchise so successful."

Sony

Company Nearer to Shipping

Videogame Consoles in China

Sony Corp. moved a step closer to shipping videogame consoles in China, as it seeks to join Microsoft Corp. in tapping a market where devices such as PlayStations and Xboxes have long been banned.

According to a filing, a factory in Shanghai¡¦s free-trade zone affiliated with the Japanese electronics company would start packaging consoles in December. The filing said the facility could package 200,000 consoles a year.

A spokesman for Sony said the 200,000 figure doesn¡¦t represent an actual business plan, adding its operation will be based on other factors such as the number of software titles it can sell. He declined to comment further on Sony¡¦s plans.

The filing was an environmental assessment posted by a Sony local partner on the official website of the free-trade zone. It didn¡¦t specify the type of console that would be shipped.

Sony signed a deal earlier this year with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group Co. to make and sell PlayStation game consoles in China. The move came after the Chinese government in September lifted a 14-year ban on the sale of videogame consoles in the country. Microsoft began selling its Xbox One through the free-trade zone late last month. China has long kept a tight leash on the videogame industry out of concern about violent content. The Xbox One titles approved for sale don¡¦t include violent games such as the ¡§Halo¡¨ and ¡§Call of Duty¡¨ titles.

The filing was reported by local media in August and on Thursday by Bloomberg News.

Workers at Chinese Plant Strike for Increase in Pay

About 1,000 workers at a Foxconn Technology Co. plant in southwest China assembling printers and computers for companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. went on strike for several hours this week demanding higher pay.

The Taiwan-based company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., said the workers walked off the job for four hours Wednesday at its production site in Chongqing. About 20 workers went on strike Thursday morning, but further details on that stoppage weren¡¦t available.

Foxconn is working with its labor union and workers to resolve the dispute, the company said Thursdayin a statement. The company said the strikes didn¡¦t disrupt production.

Management ¡§continuously increased production volumes, and even required individual workers to take on tasks that used to require two workers to handle. The increase in workload wasn¡¦t compensated,¡¨ said a worker who declined to be named. He said he participated in the strike.

¡§Some workers are not happy because the company [Foxconn] has reduced overtime hours, a key component of their salaries,¡¨ after H-P cut orders, said a Foxconn official who declined to be named. Workers also demanded the resignation of the factory manager, he said. Also, the company had tried to lay off some workers without paying severance, the official added.

Foxconn filed a complaint with the local police, he said. The reason for the complaint wasn¡¦t clear.

On the Weibo social-media service, users distributed images that appeared show hundreds of workers gathered outside the Chongqing facility Wednesday, waving protest banners as police officers looked on. The police presence at the factory continued Thursday, according to the worker.

A Chongqing police spokeswoman, however, said she wasn¡¦t aware of the strike.

Foxconn employs about 30,000 workers at its Chongqing site. The company has more than one million workers in China and is a major supplier to Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp.

The strike came after H-P said earlier this month it planned to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations as it faces intensifying competition from China¡¦s Lenovo Group Ltd. An H-P representative in Asia didn¡¦t have an immediate comment.

PepsiCo

Company Raises Forecast

PepsiCo Inc. reported better-than-expected third-quarter results despite continued volatility in emerging markets and sluggish consumer demand in developed markets.

Shares of Pepsi, up 18% over the past year, were up 33 cents at $94.27 on Thursday afternoon. The snacks and beverage maker also raised its earnings view for the year, based on its results for the first three quarters. The company now expects core per-share earnings growth of 9%, up from its prior view of 8% growth.

Pepsi has relied on its snack business lately to offset the impact of weaker demand for soda. Sales of diet soda are declining in the U.S., while concerns about soft drink consumption and obesity are rising. U.S. consumption of diet soda fell 6.3% last year while regular soda fell 1.7%, according to Beverage Digest.

Carbonated-soft-drink volume in the key North American market declined 1.5% in the third quarter, Pepsi said.

The company this month is launching its newest soft drink, a mid-calorie soda called Pepsi True, which will be sold exclusively through Amazon.com Inc.

Chairman and Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said the company still faces a challenging macroeconomic environment, including heightened volatility in emerging markets and weak demand in advanced markets.

Pepsi has batted away calls from activist investor Nelson Peltz¡¦s Trian Fund Management LP to break up the company¡¦s snack and beverages businesses, saying it is stronger with both together. PepsiCo has been losing market share to chief drinks rival Coca-Cola Co. for several years in the U.S. and abroad.

For the period ended Sept. 6, Pepsi reported a profit of $2.01 billion, up from $1.92 billion a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to $1.32 from $1.23. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges and other items, earnings were $1.36 a share. Revenue edged up 1.8% to $17.22 billion.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected earnings of $1.29 a share and revenue of $17.07 billion.

Gross margin expanded to 53.6% from 53%.

In its Americas foods business, Frito-Lay North America sales rose 3%. Latin America foods sales climbed 6%, though Quaker Foods North America sales fell 3% on volume declines.

The company¡¦s Americas beverages unit posted flat sales of $5.38 billion, while European revenue fell 1% to $3.76 billion.

Line Unveils New Features, Not New Finance

TOKYO¡XLine Corp., the owner of a popular Japanese smartphone messaging application, on Thursday introduced mobile payments and other new services in an effort to expand without immediate recourse to outside investment.

The company has attracted more than 560 million user accounts in Japan and elsewhere in Asia by offering a free chat app, cutesy digital ¡§stickers¡¨ and catchy games. Line looked set to go public later this year for as much as $9 billion, but those plans were put on hold last month, fueling speculation that it might seek a buyer or tie-up¡Xa possibility the company¡¦s chief executive rejected.

¡§At this point, we have no intention of accepting capital,¡¨ Akira Morikawa, Line¡¦s chief executive, said at a news conference, adding that Line¡¦s thinking reflected the position of its parent company, Naver Corp. of South Korea. ¡§We aren't considering that and won't consider it.¡¨

Instead, Line¡¦s focus is on expanding its business by offering new functions to compete with the latest innovations of its main rivals.

In addition to the payment feature, other new services announced Thursday include music streaming, food delivery and digital taxi-hailing, as well as a mapping function that provides detailed floor plans of department stores and other buildings.

Another new function will let users post comments publicly, as on Twitter. Until now, Line has focused on private messaging between users who know each other.

Many of the new services, including Line Pay, closely resemble features previously introduced by WeChat, a messaging platform owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. of China. Along with WhatsApp, which Facebook Inc. recently acquired for $19 billion, WeChat and Line are bidding to become global mobile communications platforms. But WeChat and Line have made only tentative steps beyond Asia so far, and many of the new Line services will only be available in Japan at first.

¡§With the presence of strong rivals, we think the U.S. market is challenging,¡¨ said Takeshi Idezawa, COO of Line. ¡§As one of the first steps, we plan to increase our presence there.¡¨

The new payment system, which Line said it would introduce in Japan this winter, will let users purchase goods and services at participating online and traditional retailers, using their smartphones. They will be able to send credit to other users of the service, or split bills with them. Line Pay, as the function is called, will also work in concert with the other new services, including the taxi-calling feature.

Mr. Morikawa and other Line executives said they would reconsider the possibility of an IPO after the new services are up and running next year¡Xan approach that analysts said made sense.

¡§If they have this payment thing running in the next six months, that could really give them a leg up,¡¨ said Neha Dharia, an analyst at Ovum, a telecommunications consulting firm. ¡§If it¡¦s successful, it could open up a huge revenue stream for them.¡¨

But Ms. Dharia said mobile payment services could be difficult to expand to other markets because that would require cooperating with local banks and navigating multiple sets of financial regulation. Line, which generated ?18.2 billion ($168 million) in sales in the April-June quarter, doesn't provide a regional breakdown of its financial results, but analysts say the vast majority of its sales come from Japan.

In Japan, the company has faced rising concern over security, following reports of a number of hacking incidents. For the payment service, it announced beefed-up security measures.

Line¡¦s new music service, which it is setting up with the music division of Sony Corp. and Avex Group, one of Japan¡¦s largest independent music companies, will offer subscription music streaming. While subscription streaming has been widely available to smartphone users in other markets for several years, rights holders in Japan have been reluctant to license their music for such services. But plunging sales of CDs and digital downloads have caused them to reassess.

Line also said it was taking steps to broaden the appeal of its mobile games¡Xuntil now aimed at mainstream audiences¡Xto try to attract more serious players. The company said it had formed several joint ventures to develop new games, including one with Gree Inc., one of Japan¡¦s leading mobile game companies.

 Sony  Is Closer to Shipping PlayStation 4 Videogame Consoles in China; Game Consoles Have Long Been Banned in China

Sony Corp. moved a step closer to shipping videogame consoles in China, as it seeks to join Microsoft Corp. in tapping a market where devices like PlayStations and Xboxes have long been banned.

According to a filing, a factory in Shanghai¡¦s free-trade zone affiliated with the Japanese electronics company would start packaging consoles in December. The filing said the facility could package 200,000 consoles a year.

A Sony spokesman said the 200,000 figure doesn¡¦t represent an actual business plan, adding its operation will be based on other factors such as the number of software titles it can sell. He declined to comment further on Sony¡¦s plans.

The filing was an environmental assessment posted by a Sony local partner on the official website of the free-trade zone. It didn¡¦t specify the type of console that would be shipped.

Sony signed a deal earlier this year with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group Co. to make and sell PlayStation game consoles in China. The move came after the Chinese government in September lifted a 14-year ban on the sale of videogame consoles in the country.

Microsoft began selling its Xbox One through the free-trade zone late last month.

China has long kept a tight leash on the videogame industry out of concern about violent content. The Xbox One titles approved for sale don¡¦t include violent games such as the ¡§Halo¡¨ and ¡§Call of Duty¡¨ titles.

The filing was reported by local media in August and on Thursday by Bloomberg News.

Eat in the Lounge, Work in the Air; Skipping Meals on Flights Makes This Executive More Productive

Glen Brasington is vice president of marketing at Pernod Ricard Asia, the regional unit of the French distiller. The Hong Kong-based Australian received valuable training as a bartender during his university days. ¡§You learn to read people very quickly,¡¨ he says. He draws on that skill as he travels around Asia promoting high-end spirits and liquor.

Mr. Brasington spoke with the Journal about replacing a keyboard after it met with a cup of tea, skipping meals on flights, and how to remove the wrinkles in Hong Kong-tailored shirts.

How often are you on the road?

Usually from June onwards is when I spend a lot of time going to our markets. In a year, I could easily be traveling for about 130 days. There are 16 Pernod affiliates whom I visit regularly, including Dubai and the Gulf states, through to Japan and down to Indonesia. I go to France, of course, where our head office is located. Now, I¡¦m more frequently in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, which need a little bit more support with the projects that we¡¦re running there.

Which airline do you fly the most?

Our company has corporate deals with Cathay Pacific and Air France. Generally, the timing of [Cathay] flights work better for me, especially around Asia, so that¡¦s what I tend to take. We also do a lot of business with Korean Air. An A380 of theirs even has an Absolut [one of Pernod¡¦s brands] bar.

Memorable in-flight service?

On a Korean Air flight to Seoul, an air stewardess spilled a cup of tea on my laptop, ruining three hours¡¦ worth of work. It was an accident and she was incredibly apologetic. Of course, I was furious¡Xnot with her¡Xbut the fact that I had no means of resolving the problem. And to think I had a full-day meeting the next day and the day after.

When I hopped off the flight, the stewardess told me she had called the Sony service center and made an appointment for me. An hour later, she called again, saying that she and her boss, the purser, would personally come for me at my hotel the next morning. They showed up as promised [and] drove me to the repair shop, where they replaced my keyboard. They paid for it. It¡¦s a story I¡¦ve told about 50 times because that was certainly service over and beyond expectation.

Favorite hotel?

I like the design style of the Andaz hotel in Shanghai. It¡¦s really modern and minimal, and the service isn¡¦t intrusive. I get annoyed, arriving at 1 a.m., and the first thing the butler wants to do is take you on a tour of the room. Another plus for Andaz is that it¡¦s directly opposite our office. Convenient location, design and efficiency are what make me book a hotel consistently.

How important are a hotel room¡¦s amenities?

I don¡¦t spend that much time in my room to be honest. The nature of the business calls for a lot of meetings at our offices and socializing, which in Pernod we call a ¡§conviviality moment.¡¨ That means dinner with my colleagues in the city I¡¦m visiting at a restaurant or hotel that stocks our products. Then the group moves on to bars that also carry our products, though it¡¦s not really to drink but more to understand the environment we operate in.

What do you do most of while flying: work, sleep or eat?

I rarely eat on flights. Meals just take too long to lay out and clean up, and this disturbs my work flow. Since I tend to do late afternoon flights, I¡¦ll try to eat in the lounge before departure.

Favorite airport lounge?

The Wing of [Cathay], of course. I¡¦m a fan of its beef cheeks, which is one of five dishes on the a la carte menu, paired with our products like Martell in a special yearlong promotion.

Do you spend time in airports?

Yes, because it¡¦s where I can shop for toiletries and get a haircut or a massage¡Xthings I can never find time to do in my free time. I¡¦m always at Zara at Hong Kong¡¦s airport. In fact, retailers like Uniqlo and H&M should be more interested in opening up there to take advantage of travelers who have more time and spending money.

Fitness regimen while traveling?

I have the best intentions but don¡¦t always have the time to work out. I still bring a skipping rope and goggles anyway.

Favorite travel app?

Skyscanner. It provides a comprehensive list of flights available on a preferred day, their routings, as well as competitive prices.

Travel advice?

If you have your shirts tailored as I do in Hong Kong, specifically ask for easy press material. Hang them up in the bathroom and the steam pretty much gets [out] the wrinkles. I never use the iron in hotels¡Xthey¡¦re usually covered in gunk.

Smartphone Maker HTC Introduces Waterproof Selfie Camera; Taiwanese Firm Turns to Photo Technology as It Pursues Turnaround

TAIPEI¡XWhile working on a product road map for smartphone maker HTC Corp. earlier this year, company Vice President Jerry Hsiao did some research.

¡§British women spend a month of their lives taking selfies,¡¨ read an article from the British tabloid the Daily Mail that Mr. Hsiao selected for a PowerPoint slideshow highlighting his findings.

While Mr. Hsiao had included the article jokingly in a presentation this week about new products from the Taiwanese company, the observation holds true that people today are often endlessly fascinated with their own images refracted through high-tech gadgets. And long-suffering HTC is hoping that tendency will help it engineer a turnaround.

On Wednesday in New York, HTC, once the world¡¦s top smartphone maker by volume in 2011, launched a waterproof action camera and software for taking selfie photos, a departure from its usual emphasis on mobile-phone hardware. HTC also unveiled a selfie-focused smartphone to bolster the company¡¦s midprice Desire line.

It is a strategic change that the company hopes will help it reverse three years of falling sales. Last year, HTC fell out of the world¡¦s top 10 smartphone brands by shipments amid branding weakness and strong competition from Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea in the high-end market and Chinese rivals such as Xiaomi in the low-cost segment. This month, the company said its third-quarter revenue fell 11% to 41.86 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$1.37 billion), compared with NT$47 billion a year earlier, despite returning to a net profit largely on cost cuts.

Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said in an interview that the company hopes its new products will help it return to sales growth in coming quarters. HTC¡¦s sales have fallen year-over-year for the past 12 quarters.

HTC¡¦s $199 Re Camera is a slim tube-shaped camera that can be clipped to a backpack, mounted on a bicycle or taken underwater. It is the company¡¦s first major venture outside smartphones since its launch of a tablet computer three years ago, and will be sold on Amazon.com and through other retailers and operators. The camera weighs about 2.5 ounces, similar to the weight of an extra-large egg.

HTC Chairwoman Cher Wang has blamed marketing weakness for the company¡¦s decline. Its third marketing chief in two years left HTC this fall, after an advertising campaign with actor Robert Downey Jr. failed to stem the company¡¦s sales slide.

In an interview, Ms. Wang said HTC is looking to invest its marketing dollars more effectively. ¡§The most important thing is to make the end-user love you,¡¨ she said.

The smartphone maker released its Zoe slideshow app free for devices powered by Google Inc.¡¦s Android software and Apple Inc.¡¦s iOS. Its newly launched selfie app, HTC Eye, offers voice-activated photo-taking and a video-chat feature that keeps a subject¡¦s face centered in the screen even if the person is walking around. The company plans to eventually make the selfie app available free of charge for non-HTC users.

HTC plans to offer the new smartphone, called Desire Eye, through AT&T Inc. later this month. Unsubsidized, the smartphone would cost between US$450 and US$500, Mr. Chang said. It comes with 13-megapixel cameras on both the front and rear and has a 5.2-inch screen.

A number of competitors await HTC in the selfie-smartphone niche. Samsung, Sony Corp. of Japan and others have also rolled out smartphones with features intended to make it easier to take and edit selfie photos.

With the Re camera, HTC will have to vie against other action-camera makers, such as GoPro Inc. of San Mateo, Calif., although HTC¡¦s ads are geared toward attracting more mainstream users. GoPro plays up its cameras¡¦ use for extreme sports.

Gartner analyst C.K. Lu said he doesn¡¦t expect the nonsmartphone business to become a chief contributor to HTC¡¦s earnings in the near future. ¡§HTC is showing improvement in its midprice smartphone offerings, which were formerly a weakness for the company,¡¨ he added. ¡§HTC could see a sales recovery in the first quarter next year as its midprice line becomes more competitive.¡¨

But HTC¡¦s Mr. Hsiao, who has been with the company more than a decade, said the new camera presages bigger change. He said HTC has been ¡§reborn¡¨ multiple times since it was founded in 1997, including its move from contract manufacturing to building its own brand, and switching from personal digital assistants to Android smartphones. And now, it is cameras and software. ¡§I think this is a turning point for the company,¡¨ he said.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a longtime minority player in a key class of computer chips, is shifting leaders as it continues a struggle to bolster its bottom line.

The company said Rory Read has stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer. He will be succeeded by Lisa Su, a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer.

Mr. Read, in a conference call, said the change reflected his regular discussions with AMD¡¦s board about succession issues. ¡§Now is the right time for her to take the reins and continue driving AMD forward,¡¨ he said.

The Sunnyvale, Calif., company since the 1980s has been a distant No. 2 behind Intel Corp. in selling microprocessor chips for personal computers based on a design called x86.

AMD added another major business in 2006 through a $5.4 billion deal to buy ATI Technologies Inc., a specialist in graphics chips that render images in videogames. That transaction saddled the company with a big debt load, a factor in frequent net losses.

Mr. Read, 52 years old, is a former International Business Machines Corp. executive who joined the company from Lenovo Group Ltd., a major chip customer. He pushed to reduce AMD¡¦s debts and diversify its business to reduce its reliance on PC chips and the competition with Intel.

One recent success was convincing Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. to use AMD chips in their latest videogame consoles. Mr. Read also pushed the company to develop chips for server systems based on technology licensed from ARM Holdings PLC that is used in most smartphones and tablets.

But older parts of AMD¡¦s business have been suffering. The company, which once accounted for around a third of the market for x86 chips used in servers, by the second quarter had a share of less than 3% in that market, according to Mercury Research.

Dean McCarron, an analyst at that firm, said AMD¡¦s share of x86 chips for laptops was 9.6%, down from 16.1% in the year-earlier period. AMD¡¦s share price has fallen more than 20% since mid-August. The stock slid 5.5% Wednesday to $3.10 in after-hours trading following news of the management change.

In July, AMD said its second-quarter loss narrowed on improved revenue and lower costs, but the company issued a third-quarter revenue forecast below analysts¡¦ estimates.

Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said Ms. Su is more popular among Wall Street analysts than Mr. Read.

¡§AMD needs growth, and they need it quickly or investors will start to get anxious,¡¨ said Patrick Moorhead, a former AMD executive who now heads the firm Moore Insights & Strategy. ¡§Lisa Su is smart, is respected inside and outside the company and I think projects a look of what people expect as an AMD CEO.¡¨

Ms. Su, another former IBMer, previously worked at Freescale Semiconductor Inc. She is widely credited with deep technical expertise and for helping AMD win deals to place its chips in new gaming consoles, Mr. McCarron said.

She is one of a few female executives at the highest management levels in semiconductors, an industry that relies heavily on electrical engineers. Another exception is Intel President Renee James, who holds the No. 2 spot at that company.

During the conference call, Ms. Su said AMD¡¦s x86 business remains important but indicated she will largely continue Mr. Read¡¦s priorities. ¡§I do very much believe that diversifying our business is critical,¡¨ she said.

Mr. Read said he would support the transition in an advisory role through the end of 2014.

Nobel Prize for LED a Morale Booster for Japanese Electronics; Country¡¦s Sector Has Lost Market Share for Lighting Technology

TOKYO¡XThe award of the Nobel Prize in physics to three scientists born in Japan stands to boost the morale of the country¡¦s beleaguered electronics industry, showing how obscure Japanese companies that specialize in parts and materials can still retain a technological edge.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on Tuesday honored the researchers for inventing the blue light-emitting diode, which has made possible lighting that is more energy-efficient than incandescent bulbs. The blue diode, which first appeared in 1992, was needed to produce white light by combining it with red and green diodes, which already existed.

One of the Nobel winners, Shuji Nakamura, was working at a Japanese maker of lighting equipment, Nichia Corp., when the breakthrough occurred. The other two, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano, helped Japanese parts supplier Toyoda Gosei Co. develop LED technology.

Nichia, which Dr. Nakamura left in 1999 in a dispute over compensation for the research, is the world¡¦s largest maker of LEDs, with $2.09 billion in sales last year, according to research firm IHS.

But Nichia¡¦s share of the $16 billion LED market was 13% last year, down from 21% in 2005, according to IHS. And while Japan is home to three of the 10 largest suppliers, Nichia, Toyoda Gosei and Stanley Electric Co., the country¡¦s share of the market is little more than 20%.

¡§Japanese companies are losing share because newcomers keep joining the market,¡¨ said IHS analyst Lee Kun Soo. The rivals include Taiwan¡¦s Everlight Electronics Co., U.S.-based Cree Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Seoul Semiconductor Co. of South Korea, and several Chinese companies. ¡§Japanese companies are going for the higher end, B-to-B applications,¡¨ Mr. Lee said.

LEDs can be used for simple household lamps or outdoor lighting, where they are slowly replacing incandescent bulbs. LEDs accounted for 15% of sales of household light sources last year, up from 4% in 2009, according to research firm Euromonitor. ¡§The publicity generated by this award is likely to boost consumer interest in LED lamps,¡¨ Euromonitor said. Consumer acceptance has been faster in Asia and continental Europe than in the U.S. and the U.K., the firm said.

Japanese companies have retained an edge in LEDs¡¦ most lucrative applications, such as automotive headlights and backlights for smartphone screens.

Nichia says it has 23% of the market for high-brightness LEDs, which are used for smartphones and other high-tech purposes.

Apple Inc.¡¦s website lists Nichia as a supplier. The U.S. company didn't respond to a request for comment, but analysts have said the Japanese company makes LEDs that are used in Apple¡¦s iPhones. Closely held Nichia, which is based in remote Tokushima prefecture on the island of Shikoku, declined to identify its clients.

While some Japanese electronics firms, such as Panasonic Corp., make consumer LED lighting, Nichia sells only to other businesses. As a result, like other Japanese companies, it may benefit less from the Nobel buzz than the makers of consumer LED products. Japan¡¦s Sony Corp. three weeks ago forecast a loss of $2.15 billion for the fiscal year through March, much more than it had previously predicted.

In a sign of the shrinking presence of the Japanese electronics industry, the nation¡¦s biggest consumer technology trade show, now under way outside Tokyo, has drawn the smallest number of exhibitors since the show¡¦s inception in 2000.

QINGDAO, China¡XDalian Wanda Group Corp., in its aim to build a Chinese version of Hollywood, said it plans to set up an annual fund of one billion yuan, or about $160 million, to lure movie producers to a planned multibillion-dollar studio project.

Wang Jianlin, chairman of the property-and-entertainment conglomerate and one of China¡¦s richest men, said the company would work with the private sector to annually provide the funding for film and television production at the Oriental Movie Metropolis, a studio project on which Wanda broke ground last year.

The Chinese coastal city of Qingdao will also provide funding, said Wanda, which owns U.S. theater chain AMC Entertainment Group. Wanda initially said Qingdao would provide half the funding, though company officials later said the amount was unspecified.

The fund is part of what Mr. Wang has said is a plan to recreate Hollywood in China.

Standing in front of a room of film producers and studio executives¡Xincluding David Glasser, chief operating officer of Weinstein Co., film deal maker John Sloss and Zhang Qiang, the newly tapped head of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.¡¦s production arm¡XMr. Wang touted the access to funds and facilities that the industry would find in Qingdao.

¡§If you don¡¦t go to China, where will you go?¡¨ Mr. Wang said.

He added that a district government within Qingdao is promising subsidies of as much as 10% of a production studio¡¦s annual revenue.

Wanda last year announced an investment of 30 billion yuan to 50 billion yuan in an entertainment center in Qingdao that will partially open in 2016 and will include a theme park, a film museum, a wax museum and a massive film studio.

A number of other Chinese companies and cities have announced plans to set up facilities to lure the entertainment industry. Mr. Wang says he is putting his money where his mouth is to ensure that the project takes off. ¡§The Oriental Movie Metropolis will certainly succeed,¡¨ he said.

In September of last year, he flew out Hollywood stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Nicole Kidman, as well as David Kosse, then-president of the international division of Comcast Corp.¡¦s Universal Pictures, and Ralph Alexander, a senior executive vice president of Sony Corp.¡¦s entertainment international operations, to attend the groundbreaking. Mr. Wang said the film studio would be the world¡¦s largest and told producers that they would benefit from its planned research-and-development and special-effects centers.

Wanda says it has already made inroads in film projects, signing a deal late last year with Weinstein Co. to produce ¡§Southpaw,¡¨ a boxing film starring actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Wanda is also setting up a base for entertainment investments as part of a $1.2 billion real-estate development in Los Angeles.

Taiwan¡¦s Export Growth Slips; Demand for Electronic Components Partially Offset by Plunge in Smartphone, Petrochemical Sales.

TAIPEI¡XTaiwan¡¦s export growth slipped in September, as strong demand for electronic components ahead of the year-end holiday season were partially offset by a plunge in smartphone and petrochemical sales.

Taiwan shipped $26.43 billion of goods abroad last month, the Ministry of Finance said Tuesday. It was a 4.7% increase from the same month last year but a 5.9% decline from August.

Some economists said export growth might have peaked in August, a month before Apple Inc.¡¦s official launch of its new iPhones. The Cupertino, California-based company buys parts including microprocessors and camera lenses from Taiwan. But some others said Taiwanese overseas sales in the fourth quarter will likely continue to grow at high single-digit rates, citing strong follow-on orders for the new iPhones and improving demand among U.S. consumers.

Driven by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.¡¦s sales of computing chips to Apple, exports of semiconductors rose a strong 15% last month from a year earlier, the ministry said. Total overseas sales of electronic goods, which include semiconductors, totaled $8.89 billion in September. It was slightly less than August¡¦s $9.23 billion, which was a record high.

Component makers from Taiwan are playing a central role in the global electronics supply chain, selling components to Apple and other tech behemoths such as Sony and Microsoft.

However, exports of Taiwanese-made smartphones dived 39% last month. Sales of petrochemicals also dropped 9.2%. The government said falling energy prices led some factories to delay stocking up inventories.

Although Thanksgiving and Christmas are months away, some U.S. retailers have begun offering discounts to lure consumers. Taiwan¡¦s exports to the U.S., comprising mostly electronics, gained 8.8% last month, sharply higher than a 4.9% rise in August.

However, exports to Europe added only 1.2%, compared with a 13.5% rise in August. Exports to China also slowed as the world¡¦s second-largest economy still struggled to regain its growth momentum. Shipments to China and Hong Kong, Taiwan¡¦s biggest export markets, were up 3.6% in September, down from a 8.7% rise in August.

Overall exports have grown 3.5% so far this year, exceeding the government¡¦s target of a 3.21% rise for the entire year¡Xbut still below the double-digit percentage expansion often seen in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Imports in September rose 0.2% to US$22.93 billion, much slower than August¡¦s 14.1% rise. The trade surplus decreased to $3.50 billion from $4.11 billion a month earlier.

World
What¡¦s Behind Japan¡¦s Profit Rebound? Unsexy Companies Like Toray; Little Known Abroad, Companies in More Pedestrian Industries Boost Economy Again

TOKYO¡XCorporate Japan is posting record profits again. It has companies like Toray to thank, again.

Toray isn¡¦t a household name outside Japan. But unlike some such as Sony Corp. that are, Toray Industries Inc. is thriving, along with other companies in more-pedestrian industries that are helping lead Japan¡¦s comeback from two decades of economic torpor.

Toray helped Japan out of crisis once before: Amid the devastation after World War II, the textile maker was among the big exporters that revived the economy. Today, it exports carbon fiber for Boeing airliners, fabric for Uniqlo underwear, absorbent elements for disposable diapers and hundreds of other materials.

Toray expects to report its highest net income ever in the current fiscal year. By contrast, \b Sony\b0  Corp. says it will report a ?230 billion ($2.1 billion) loss.¡§There is always a need for our products in the long term,¡¨ says Toray President Akihiro Nikkaku of basic-materials makers. ¡§It¡¦s true,¡¨ he says, ¡§consumers do not really know much about it.¡¨

The travails of Japan¡¦s famous consumer-electronics industry have fed the narrative of a Japan in decline. But the country is proving to have a resilient base in the more-prosaic companies and industries that are a big part of its profit comeback.

Net income at the country¡¦s major corporations rose 69% to a record ?25.3 trillion in the fiscal year ended in March from the prior year, according to SMBC Nikko Securities. Major manufacturers¡¦ net income grew 116% to ?12.1 trillion, and many companies are forecasting further gains for the July-September period.



Those corporate profits are a major factor behind the recent strength of the Nikkei Stock Average, which closed at 16,374.14 on Sept. 25, its highest level since 2007, before falling to 15,708.65 on Friday.

¡§Everybody wants to write Japan off, but it¡¦s still the third-largest economy in the world, and we have to ask why,¡¨ says Ulrike Schaede, professor of Japanese business at the University of California, San Diego. ¡§Everybody focuses on the zombie companies, but there are all these great firms, most of which no one has heard of. It¡¦s a quiet revolution.¡¨

Or a quiet restoration.

Japan¡¦s postwar economic miracle was driven especially by companies that exported materials, parts and industrial products¡Xnot by consumer-goods companies.

Well into the 1960s, Japan¡¦s top exports were steel, textiles, fish and ships, according to the Japan Foreign Trade Council. In 1962, consumer durable goods represented only 14% of Japan¡¦s overall exports, according to the Japan Tariff Association.

Global perceptions of ¡§Japan Inc.¡¨ changed during Japan¡¦s bubble era of the 1980s. Consumer-electronics brands like Sony, Nintendo Co. and Panasonic Corp. were among growth leaders¡Xalong with auto companies¡Xand came to symbolize Japan¡¦s ascent abroad.

By 1986, consumer durables rose to 30% of Japan¡¦s exports. Cars, office appliances, tape recorders and precision devices like cameras joined steel atop Japan¡¦s export rankings.

But by 2013, consumer durables had receded to 16% of exports. Cars were still Japan¡¦s top export. But they were followed by steel, electronic parts, auto parts and organic chemicals.

Sony¡¦s fall from grace has been echoed at some other consumer companies. At Nintendo, sales fell 44% over the last three fiscal years to below the level in the year ended March 1999. A spokesman attributes the decline to the game industry¡¦s volatility rather than any weakness in connecting with consumers.

In final consumer goods, Japan swung to a $52 billion trade deficit in 2012 from a $25 billion trade surplus in 2007. In contrast, Japan¡¦s trade surplus in parts used in all sorts of manufacturing grew to $137 billion from $116 billion.

¡§Because Japan has clearly lost competitive advantage in consumer electronics¡¨ says Kathy Matsui, chief Japan equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, ¡§it makes sense to go up the value chain and focus on high-end materials and high-value parts.¡¨

The Nikkei¡¦s rise also reflects the yen¡¦s slump, which makes Japan¡¦s exports more affordable in dollar terms and lifts the value in yen terms of overseas sales. That helps many parts providers, who tend to manufacture more in Japan than finished-goods makers.

Reflecting the pendulum¡¦s swing back from consumer goods, some giants are returning to their roots. Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp. and NEC Corp., soon after the war, grew by exporting industrial products like locomotives, gas turbines and telecommunications equipment. By the 1980s, they had jumped on the consumer bandwagon, shifting some energies into TV sets, home appliances and, later, smartphones.

They suffered for it. Competitors in countries like South Korea and China eventually undercut their prices. Their smartphones, often designed for the Japanese market, never took off overseas.

Now the three have shed many consumer operations and doubled down on businesses like heavy machinery, industrial electronics and satellites. After posting cumulative losses of ?985 billion for the four fiscal years ended March 2010, Hitachi swung back to a cumulative net income of ?1.03 trillion in the four years since then.

Toshiba and NEC have shown similar, though less dramatic, swings. Hitachi didn¡¦t respond to inquiries. Toshiba President Hisao Tanaka in May told analysts that the company intended to ¡§accelerate our shift to b-to-b.¡¨ An NEC spokesman says the company ¡§is clearly moving towards infrastructure investment.¡¨

Panasonic¡¦s remake is particularly striking. A consumer-electronics maker for most of its 96 years, it has quit the consumer-smartphone market, stopped making plasma-screen TV sets and sharply reduced its camera output. It says it sees greater opportunities in areas like auto parts and housing. Panasonic is a major supplier of electric-car batteries, agreeing to invest in Tesla Motors Inc.¡¦s planned $5 billion Nevada battery plant.

For the latest fiscal year, Panasonic posted net income of ?120 billion after a ?754 billion loss a year earlier. Asked about its transformation, Panasonic points to President Kazuhiro Tsuga¡¦s public comments in April, when he said the company¡¦s strategic shift was progressing well.

Then there is the broad base of companies that are little known abroad. Japan hasn¡¦t made a mark in smartphones. But parts suppliers like Murata Manufacturing Co., Nidec Corp. and Omron Corp. are benefiting from the tiny specialized parts they make for smartphones and other high-tech devices. The three posted strong gains in net income in the latest fiscal year.

In a Bain & Co. list of consistently successful companies¡Xposting annual growth over 5.5% in sales and earnings over 10 years while delivering profits above cost of capital¡Xabout a third of the 42 Japanese companies listed were in behind-the-scenes industries like car parts, chemicals, construction and engineering. In the 1990s, none of these industries made Bain¡¦s list.

The shift is toward ¡§upstream¡¨ companies, says Shintaro Okuno, a Bain partner in Tokyo, especially parts makers. ¡§It¡¦s still manufacturing, but a completely different kind of manufacturing.¡¨

Toray¡¦s role among such companies was reinforced this summer when Keidanren, the Japanese business lobby, named Toray Chairman Sadayuki Sakakibara its head. He succeeded another leader in industrial materials, Chairman Hiromasa Yonekura of Sumitomo Chemical Co. The two previous heads were from Canon Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp.

Toray started in 1926 as a maker of synthetic fabrics and later branched into other fabrics and chemicals. Textiles were a big ingredient in Japan¡¦s postwar rebound: In the 1950s, textiles and related products rose to as high as 40% of Japan¡¦s exports, and Toray became one of the nation¡¦s major exporters.

As Japan increased consumer exports, Toray, too, sought to get closer to the consumer with branded materials such as Ultrasuede, a synthetic fabric with a leather feel. But Toray continued to develop industrial materials.

Its relationship with Boeing Co. shows how decisions it was making decades ago¡Xas consumer companies were ascending¡Xare bearing fruit today.

In the 1970s and 1980s, when some carbon-fiber makers were quitting the business for lack of customers, Toray fine-tuned its technology and manufacturing. That gave it a global advantage when carbon fiber came into its own, says Yoshihiro Azuma, a Jefferies analyst.

In 2006, Toray struck a supply deal with Boeing set to run through 2021 for the 787 jetliner, in which carbon fiber is the main structural material. Expecting increased orders from Boeing, Toray recently announced plans to invest $1 billion in a new South Carolina factory. ¡§It¡¦s a great example of how basic materials can be so powerful that they can substantively change the world,¡¨ Mr. Nikkaku says.

¡§Toray has been a market leader and a valuable contributor to advancements in aerospace design and performance,¡¨ a Boeing spokesman says.

Long-term supply deals like this helped sustain Toray during Japan¡¦s economic malaise. Sales dipped during the global recession, and Toray posted losses in the years ended March 2009 and March 2010. It has snapped back, recording a 23% net-income increase in the year ended March 31 from a year earlier on a 15% increase in sales to ?1.8 trillion.

¡§With companies like this, the economy has legs to stand on,¡¨ says Jesper Koll, head of Japan equity research at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ¡§Today it¡¦s Toray, tomorrow it¡¦s Olympus with a new medical device, the next day it¡¦s Fujifilm.¡¨

Over 70% of Olympus Corp.¡¦s global sales are from medical devices, a spokesman says, and ¡§our main business is no longer consumer products.¡¨ Fujifilm Corp. is expanding into areas such as health care, graphic systems and industrial materials.

Having expanded carbon fiber into everything from fishing rods to windmills, Toray is looking for new markets for it. This year, it bought Zoltek Companies Inc., a U.S. supplier of carbon fiber to the automotive business. It also makes materials used in semiconductor manufacturing, lithium-ion batteries, fiber-optic cables and polypropylene spunbond fiber, an absorbent material in disposable diapers.

Toray is also profiting in its oldest market: clothing. Uniqlo, the Japanese apparel chain owned by Fast Retailing Co., has sold more than 400 million items in its Heattech line of T-shirts, underwear and other clothing made with a new Toray blend of polyester, acrylic, rayon and spandex. Uniqlo declines to discuss details of its Toray relationship.

¡§The long-term assumption here is that fiber is a growth industry,¡¨ says Toray¡¦s Mr. Nikkaku.

Toray¡¦s trade-off for long-term supply deals, some analysts say, is its modest profit margins. Its 7.6% return on equity in its most recent year is less than half that of some global chemical-industry leaders, they say.

¡§If we were to focus only on immediate issues, we would derail,¡¨ Mr. Nikkaku says. ¡§We always look 10, 20 years ahead.¡¨ Toray¡¦s shares are up 13% over the past 12 months, versus the Nikkei¡¦s 11% rise.

Japanese suppliers of materials and components may eventually lose their global edge, some say. South Korea and China will eventually undercut Japanese parts suppliers just as they did with finished gadgets, says William Saito, a venture capitalist who advises the Japanese government on technology strategy. Japan needs to develop trendsetting consumer products or services to provide the profit margins the economy needs, he says.

Sony, meanwhile, continues to struggle in its consumer markets. In September, it said it expected to post a loss of almost five times what it forecast four months earlier for the current fiscal year as it wrote down the book value of its mobile communications unit.

It is edging out of some consumer businesses, recently selling its PC business and making its TV operation a free-standing unit.

And it is increasing its bet on high-tech components for other people¡¦s products. While few outside Japan want to buy Sony¡¦s smartphones, its image sensors for smartphone cameras are used even by Apple Inc. Sony is supplying them for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, says Chipworks, a patent-research firm. Apple didn¡¦t respond to inquiries. Sony declined to comment.

In July, \b Sony\b0  said it would spend $345 million to increase sensor-production capacity.

And even if it pulls that off, its hedge-fund lenders, rather than the retailer's shareholders, will reap most of the rewards. (http://on.wsj.com/1rQmS2u)

Laura Nyro's Heartbreaking Spirit Summoned by "Map to the Treasure" LP

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - For many people weaned on the music of the '60s/'70s, Laura Nyro was one of those ungraspable artists -- someone they knew of but didn't follow or know much about. She was idolized by David Geffen, who signed her as his first big client, but he couldn't elevate her to commercial stardom as a solo artist. To this day there are debates about her set at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, when she was still in her teens: Was she booed off the stage or embraced as a revelation?

But even if Nyro remained a mystery to the masses, she was a savior to a number of artists who rode her songs to chart-topping success, including Blood, Sweat & Tears ("And When I Die"), Three Dog Night ("Eli's Comin'"), Barbra Streisand ("Stoney End") and, especially, the Fifth Dimension ("Wedding Bell Blues," "Stone Soul Picnic," "Sweet Blindness," "Save the Country').

Sheila Weller's "Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon and the Journey of a Generation" could very well have included Nyro, who died in 1997, since she influenced all those self-empowered singer-songwriters who exhibited an equal facility for rich, confessional storytelling.

Jazz pianist Billy Childs, whose tribute album "Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro" was recently released on Sony Masterworks, calls her "not just a singer-songwriter, but a serious composer." And one just need listen to a track like "Timer," from Nyro's landmark "Eli and the Thirteenth Confession," to hear how she pushed the envelope: a mini-suite with changing tempos, sliding scales and overlapping vocals.

At a Grammy Museum event celebrating the album, and Nyro's music, on Tuesday night, Childs said he thinks of Nyro's work as "an opera about a girl in New York City," and Rickie Lee Jones, one of the vocalists on hand who appears on the album, even summoned the spirit of "West Side Story" in her recollection. "I was always dreaming and it was clear she was dreaming," said Jones. "I was always on fire escapes and she was writing fiction to me."

It was clear Nyro served as a unique inspiration to the talent on hand, including singers Shawn Colvin and Becca Stevens, because they viewed her as a kindred spirit. Jones, who discovered Nyro in the early '70s, recalls that "at the time, Janis Joplin was the main girl and I just could not sing anything like her; I have no roughness in my voice. But Laura had this softness about her. She was a teacher but also someone like me."

The tribute album, a term that Child eschews, attracted an astounding level of talent, all drawn to the heart, heartbreak and complexity of Nyro's music, including Alison Krauss, Dianne Reeves, Renee Fleming, Esperanza Spalding, Yo-Yo Ma, Alison Krauss Wayne Shorter and many others.

Colvin, also present at the Grammy Museum, was under the impression that Nyro hadn't been celebrated in a similar fashion prior, which she thought was "weird." But in fact, the album, "Time and Love: The Music of Laura Nyro" was released in 1997 (Astor Place) and included many of the alternative artists, all female, of the day, including Phoebe Snow, Suzanne Vega, Jane Siberry and Jill Sobule. Although that prior recording is a tad too twee at times, Roseanne Cash's version of "Save the Country" might be worth the purchase alone.

Like Cash, Childs and Colvin's version of the song is more elegaic than the original, upbeat recordings by Nyro and the Fifth Dimension, reflecting, in Childs' words, the tumult of the time when the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King left the country shaken, and the Vietnam war raged on, creating a violent schism of ideologies.

Of her take on the song in "Map to the Treasure," Colvin confided: "I think we nailed the quiet desperation."

Box Office: 'Gone Girl' Surging to $35 Million-Plus Weekend

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are showing solid drawing power as "Gone Girl" heads for an opening weekend of at least $35 million in the U.S., according to early estimates Friday.

Fox's "Gone Girl" looked likely to draw more than $12 million on its opening day at 3,014 locations.

That should be enough to give the thriller a winning weekend over New Line's scarefest "Annabelle," which will probably take in about $14 million Friday and wind up the weekend with an equally impressive $30 million at 3,185.

That scenario would represent a shot in the arm for studios and exhibitors. Should both "Gone Girl" and "Annabelle" finish above $30 million, it would be first time time in two months that two titles have cleared that figure since the Aug. 8-10 frame with "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "Guardians and the Galaxy."

"Annabelle" took in a solid $2.1 million in late-night showings Thursday, topping "Gone Girl," started respectably with $1.25 million at 2,370 sites.

"Gone Girl" appears to be effectively leveraging the poularity of Gillian Flynn's novel, in which a husband in a fading marriage becomes the key suspect in his wife's disappearance. Promotions for "Gone Girl" have taken taken advantage of Affleck's considerable star power with a voice in one trailer asking, "How does it feel to be the most hated man in America?"

Both "Gone Girl" and "Annabelle" are R-rated and have been aimed at attracting mature audiences.

David Fincher directed "Gone Girl" with Fox and New Regency producing for $61 million.

"Annabelle," which stars Annabelle Wallis, will make back its $6.5 million budget on its first day. New Line and Warner Bros. appear to have tapped into the surprise success of "The Conjuring," which introduced the creepy Annabelle doll as part of its catalog of possessed objects.

"Annabelle" is directed by John R. Leonetti (James Wan's longtime cinematographer) from Gary Dauberman 's script with Peter Safran and Wan producing.

Conversely, Nicholas Cage's faith-based "Left Behind" appeared to be showing little traction with a first-day gross of $900,000 for Freestyle, projecting to about $2.7 million for the weekend.

Denzel Washington's "The Equalizer" led the rest of the pack with an early estimate of $5.5 million on Friday, portending a second weekend of about $18 million for Sony - a decline of about 47%, which would give it about $64 million for its first 10 days.

Fox's third weekend of "The Maze Runner" looked likely to finish fourth with $3 million on Friday and a $10 million weekend, edging Focus' second weekend of "The Boxtrolls" at about $9 million.

Angry Birds Maker Rovio to Cut up to 130 Jobs in Finland; Games Maker to Simplify Organization Around Areas of Growth Potential

STOCKHOLM¡X¡§Angry Birds¡¨ maker Rovio Entertainment Ltd. admitted Thursday to counting its chickens before they were hatched.

The Finnish games company, which shot to fame with the online and mobile game featuring colored, flying birds, said it would eliminate 130 employees, or about 16% of its workforce, amid flattening revenue and difficulties finding fresh growth opportunities. The company said it had bulked up its staff in anticipation of stronger growth.

¡§We have been building our team on assumptions of faster growth than have materialized,¡¨ the company said in a statement.

Rovio said it plans to reduce the size of its staff in an effort to simplify its organization around its three businesses with the ¡§highest growth potential¡¨: games, media and consumer products.

It didn¡¦t say Thursday which staff would be cut, or which of its operations it would downsize, and wasn¡¦t immediately available to elaborate. Rovio had more than 800 employees as of June, up from about 500 at the end of 2012.

Rovio and the ¡§Angry Birds¡¨ game series have seen their wings clipped in recent years amid stiff competition from a new breed of mobile games developers, such as Supercell Oy and Anglo-Swedish King Digital Entertainment PLC, the maker of ¡§Candy Crush Saga.¡¨

These companies have beefed up marketing expenses to the point that it is hard for companies with smaller balance sheets to break through. King Digital, for instance, last year spent considerably more marketing money to acquire and retain users than Rovio¡¦s annual sales.

King¡¦s revenue last year was $1.9 billion and the company says it commits a quarter of revenue to marketing, around half a billion last year. Rovio¡¦s revenue, meanwhile, was $197 million, which means that King spent more than twice Rovio¡¦s revenue on marketing alone.

Rovio has invested heavily into an ¡§Angry Birds¡¨-themed movie, set to hit the big screens in 2016. Starring Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones and Jason Sudeikis, the project is Rovio¡¦s largest-ever investment and will be distributed by Sony Pictures.

The staff cuts follow a decision in August to replace Chief Executive Mikael Hed, the son of Rovio¡¦s chairman Kaj Hed and a major shareholder in the company, who will step down from his position as of January next year.

Mr. Hed, who will be succeeded by Nokia Corp. veteran Pekka Rantala, has attempted to overhaul Rovio¡¦s games revenue model, making downloads free and charging users for purchases made when in the game.

Recent releases, however, haven¡¦t made much of an impact and Mr. Hed admitted in an earlier interview that his efforts to turn the company around have taken longer than anticipated.

Last year, the closely held company saw revenue flattening significantly compared with its recent years of strong growth, as it booked £á156 million ($197 million) in revenue, from £á152.2 million in the previous year. Net profit, meanwhile, more than halved to £á26.9 million.

Last month, Rovio released the latest game in the Angry Birds¡¦ franchise, a free-to-play slingshot game called Stella, largely aimed at a female audience. Although it was initially downloaded in large numbers, Stella failed to make much money and isn¡¦t among the hundred best-grossing mobile apps in the U.S. on either Google Inc.¡¦s Play Store or Apple Inc.¡¦s App Store.

Stella¡¦s dismal financial performance follows several recent flops from the company, including ¡§Angry Birds Epic,¡¨ a role-playing game; and ¡§Angry Birds GO!,¡¨ a racing game¡Xboth of which had millions of installs and received good reviews. But they failed to nail the free-to-play model that has proved so profitable for some of Rovio¡¦s peers.

The company has also tried to depart from the Angry Birds brand, with games such as Amazing Alex, a Rube Goldberg device-building game; and Tiny Thief, a stealth-based puzzle game; neither saw much commercial success.

Amid the company¡¦s paltry performance, a number of executives have left the company, including the company¡¦s former chief operating officer, and the executive in charge of game development. Tuomas Erikoinen, who created the original artwork for Angry Birds and designed its first characters, left the company to form another game developer in 2012.

SoftBank to Sell  Sony  Flagship Phone; Xperia Z3 Has 4K-Video and PlayStation 4 Remote Play Functions

TOKYO¡XSoftBank Corp. will carry Sony Corp.'s latest smartphone, the two companies confirmed on Wednesday, possibly giving the heavily diversified electronics maker's struggling mobile business a lift.

The Wall Street Journal reported in August that SoftBank will likely sell the Xperia Z3 for the first time in Japan, and also in the U.S., through its subsidiary Sprint Corp. A SoftBank spokesman said that Wednesday's announcement just pertains to the domestic market.

Sony's flagship smartphone comes with high-resolution audio, 4K-video and PlayStation 4 remote play functions. It will be available from November and will be free of charge in Japan for people switching from other carriers after the completion of a two-year contract.

It was only last month that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai apologized to investors after the company said its projected net loss for the fiscal year ending in March next year would expand to ?230 billion ($2.12 billion)¡Xalmost five times what it said previously. Sony blamed the company's mobile business, which Mr. Hirai said was struggling due to increasing competition. At the news conference, he said the company will be focusing on premium models rather than entry models, and it will be selective on which markets it sells the Xperia smartphone to.

The announcement means all three major Japanese mobile-phone carriers¡XSoftBank, NTT Docomo Inc. and KDDI Corp.¡Xwill sell Sony's smartphones. Analysts say the key for Sony to prop up its mobile business is to have a presence in big markets like the U.S. Sprint is very likely to announce they will sell the Xperia soon, people familiar with the situation said.

U.S. regulators look into treating Internet TV like cable

WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering a change in how it regulates Internet TV, potentially putting it on the same footing as traditional cable and satellite television, an FCC official familiar with the idea said on Tuesday.

If formalized and approved, the change would help Internet TV services, such as ones being developed by Dish Network Corp , Sony Corp and Verizon Communications Inc , compete with traditional pay-TV for digital rights to major network programming.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, however, indicated the plan has not been circulated yet to the four FCC commissioners, who would have to vote to formally propose it and begin the process of collecting public comments.

"Somebody found out that it was an idea that was being kicked around ... and that's where it stands," Wheeler said Tuesday. "I'm not ready to plant the flag," he added.

The idea concerns online subscription video services that offer scheduled programming similar to traditional pay-TV providers, and not online video services such as Netflix Inc that stream content on-demand.

Traditionally, the FCC has ensured that cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp could negotiate for rights to retransmit major network programming. Online video services have not had the same regulatory backing because they rely on a different technology and do not have their own video distribution facilities.

Now, the FCC's Media Bureau is proposing leveling the playing field with a technology-neutral definition of a "multichannel video program distributor," said the FCC official who spoke anonymously to discuss matters that have not been made public. The goal behind the plan is to encourage new and stronger competition in the video market.

"You want to make sure that you're always keeping up with technology, you're always keeping up with innovations in the marketplace. This falls into that kind of category," Wheeler told reporters, when asked what prompted the consideration.

A draft of the proposal tentatively concludes that Internet TV services should have the same access to major network programming as traditional pay-TV services and seeks comments on whether the obligations imposed on the two types of video services should also be the same, the FCC official said.

It was unclear how quickly the proposal could come up for a vote by FCC commissioners, but it could potentially be as soon as Oct. 17.

If adopted, analysts see the proposal as creating a possible new opening for Aereo, a video streaming company whose business model was questioned by a Supreme Court ruling in June that said the company had infringed broadcasters' copyrights by capturing live and recorded programs through antennas and transmitting them to subscribers.

U.S. judge reduces copyright verdict against ex-MP3tunes chief

Sept 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday reduced a $48 million copyright infringement verdict against the former chief executive of defunct online music storage firm MP3tunes, the latest turn in long running court battles between the music industry and online content providers.               

U.S. District Judge William Pauley III in Manhattan cut a punitive damages award to $750,000 from $7.5 million, and additional aspects of the ruling could reduce the total amount further, according to an attorney for ex-MP3tunes Chief Executive Officer Michael Robertson.               

The judge gave both sides until Oct. 17 to submit proposals for a final judgment.               

EMI Group Ltd contended in a 2007 lawsuit that the MP3tunes website and a related one called Sideload.com enabled the infringement of copyrights in sound recordings, musical compositions and cover art.               

In the years since the lawsuit was filed, EMI was split up, with Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group buying its recording music business and a consortium led by Sony Corp  acquiring its publishing arm in 2012.               

Earlier this year a Manhattan jury found MP3tunes and Robertson liable for copyright infringement and awarded $48.1 million in damages.               

After the reduction in punitive damages on Monday, the music companies can either accept the decision or embark on a new trial on punitive damages, the ruling said.               

Other legal findings made by Pauley will make the total verdict "closer to $10 million than $40 million," said Robertson's attorney Ira Sacks. Attorneys for the music companies could not immediately be reached for comment.               

Founded in 2005 initially as a website selling independent musicians' songs, San Diego-based MP3tunes came to be known for its so-called cloud music service that allowed users to store music in online lockers. The lawsuit was regarded in some circles as a barometer for how courts might view cloud-based music storage services.               

"While the world has moved beyond the free-MP3-download craze, the parties in this case have not," Pauley wrote.

Can GoPro Hero4 Make You a Vacation Hero?; New Line of Cameras Brings Extreme Photography Down to Earth, but Stock Up on Batteries

GoPro Inc., the company known for rugged little cameras used by extreme surfers and snowboarders, has new models that might appeal to a more timid demographic.

In stores Oct. 5, the first new cameras since GoPro¡¦s blockbuster summer initial public offering aren¡¦t big reinventions. They¡¦re subtle but important improvements to help the less extreme among us create the whoa-check-that-out perspectives that made GoPro a cultural phenomenon.

One is a $400 version called Hero4 Silver that adds a touch screen, finally making GoPro as easy to use as normal cameras. Another is a new version of its palm-size camera that¡¦s cheap enough¡X$130¡Xto lose or break on vacation. (A third, the $500 Hero4 Black, will appeal to pros, with a faster processor for shooting video at four times the resolution of high definition.)

I¡¦ve had a chance to dangle two of the new GoPros out of a cable car, clamp them to a go-kart, and strap them to a ¡§selfie stick¡¨¡Xamong other vacationing challenges¡Xand the experience was eye-opening. The cameras suffer from a short 2.5-hour battery life, but GoPro is now worth considering as the go-anywhere camera for the rest of us.

Don¡¦t we have smartphones for that? Those cameras have gotten remarkably good at taking photos and video, and are usually close at hand to capture a moment. But GoPros can do two things most smartphones can¡¦t: First, you can stick them places a phone might not fit, or you might not like. Second, GoPros have a 170 degree wide-angle lens that makes it easy to capture most situations in focus.

Here¡¦s the problem: Nobody really wants to watch our boring vacation videos. Does a GoPro help produce footage of a less thrill-seeking life that is worthy of Facebook and YouTube?

To answer, I spent last Thursday as a tourist in my town of San Francisco, with one GoPro in my hand and another strapped to my head. The day¡¦s events were planned by GoPro for training but all the footage you see in this review is my own. Our itinerary included riding a cable car and go-karts, taking a boat ride around San Francisco Bay, and trampolining¡Xyes, trampolining¡Xby the Golden Gate Bridge. I continued testing the cameras through the weekend, capturing more ordinary moments: a mountain hike, a drive around town and a sunset. Even then, I found myself taking shots with the GoPros I couldn¡¦t¡Xor just hadn¡¦t¡Xwith other cameras.

GoPro isn¡¦t the only small camera on the market; Sony and Garmin make models that are only a tad larger, and smartphone maker HTC has hinted at a coming waterproof camera.

What makes GoPros so effective is solid imaging technology in a tiny package that doesn¡¦t feel precious. You accessorize them with a collection of straps and clamping doodads that encourage¡Xactually, demand¡Xexperimentation, like the ¡§Chesty¡¨ chest mount and ¡§Fetch¡¨ dog-harness mount. There¡¦s even a line of mounts for guitars and drums.

The new cameras tout improved sensors and processors that mean better shots and more creative options.

Since the top-model Hero4 Black shoots 4K video at 30 frames a second, I used it to zoom in on the Golden Gate Bridge when I couldn¡¦t get close enough to fill the frame. (Warning: the video files it produces at that resolution are gargantuan¡Xfive minutes takes up more than two gigabytes on a storage card, sold separately.)

The image quality isn¡¦t as professional as a digital SLR camera but it is impressive for such a portable package. In my tests on a swaying boat at night, the Hero4 Silver¡¦s wide-angle lens picked up clouds above a cityscape more dramatically than the iPhone 6 but wasn¡¦t as good at capturing neon signs. I also made a cool time-lapse video of a sunset by making the GoPro take a 12-megapixel photo twice a minute over a few hours; both Hero4 models can take up to 30 of those a second.

For video, you¡¦re able to shoot up to 120 frames a second¡Xthe number of still images that combine to create motion¡Xletting you use GoPro¡¦s editing software to slow down the action and make anyone look like a character from ¡§The Matrix.¡¨ (It helps if you have a trampoline handy.) A button lets you tag interesting moments that you want to find quickly when it comes time to edit. I wish GoPros also had GPS technology so I could tag locations, too.

Previous models may have helped extreme athletes capture insane video but they didn¡¦t have LCD screens and were cumbersome to use. The addition of a display to the Hero4 Silver makes it much more user friendly. Controlling the camera from the screen on the back means you can preview shots, and get less up-the-nose footage of you fiddling with button s while the camera is rolling. (GoPro has previously sold a $70 add-on touchscreen, but it added bulk to the camera.)

Alas, the built-in screen is only on the new Hero4 Silver model. The Hero and Hero4 Black have streamlined their menus but still must be controlled with three buttons and a dim black-and-gray screen on the front. I recommend the Silver model for anyone but the pros.

My biggest reservation is that both Hero4 cameras I tested still have too-short battery lives¡Xabout 2.5 hours. (I burned through three or four batteries in a day of heavy usage.) The screen on the Silver model is an even further tax; anyone thinking about taking one on vacation will want to carry a few battery backups, which cost $20.

I wasn¡¦t able to evaluate one other important factor: how easy it is to get footage from the new GoPros online. GoPros have wireless connections, and the company is building a new version of its smartphone app that will let you control your camera, view what you¡¦ve taken, and share photos via Instagram and Facebook. I couldn¡¦t test it¡Xthe app isn¡¦t finished¡Xbut it was clear from a brief demo that using the app will be yet another drain the camera¡¦s lightweight battery.

To get video and photos online, I used GoPro Studio on my computer. GoPro¡¦s editing software is powerful but lacks a simple way to post to the Internet.

My time with the cameras did produce Instagram-worthy footage. But could I have done the same thing without a GoPro if I put my mind to it?

When I was crossing San Francisco¡¦s Bay Bridge on Saturday, I attached a GoPro to one of its ¡§3-Way¡¨ stick mounts, and poked it out of my passenger window like a periscope. On such a windy bridge, this felt unwise at first, but the driver of a car next to me flashed me a broad smile that read, ¡§Righteous, dude.¡¨

The camera stayed in its mount and captured the whole span. It¡¦s an amazing video, especially when sped up. I¡¦ve always dreamed of taking that shot but never would have done it with my phone or, God forbid, fancy DSLR.

Having a GoPro gave me the excuse to go out and try more interesting shots, which is ultimately the key to less-boring footage.

Musical Trips, Temporal & Geographic

Even though Herb Alpert and Sergio Mendes have both been steadily making music for well over 50 years, the music of those two tightly interconnected instrumentalist-producer-maestros, who both currently have new releases out, is extricably associated with the mid-to-late 1960s.

Apart from the way their careers and personal lives have been linked¡XLani Hall, most famously a singer in Mr. Mendes's ensemble, who has been Mrs. Alpert since 1973¡Xthe two have a lot in common: They're both among the final artists who achieved blockbuster hits as interpreters of songs composed by others (prior to the takeover by singer-songwriters at the start of the 1970s). And, perhaps not coincidentally, they're also among the few hitmakers of the rock 'n' roll era whose appeal wasn't specific to any one generation. During The Great Society years, kids were buying the Rolling Stones and The Supremes, while their parents bought Dean Martin and Perry Como. But everybody bought Sergio Mendes's Brasil '66 and Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass.

Now Mr. Alpert's "In the Mood" (Shout! Factory) and Mr. Mendes's "Magic" (Sony) show the two auteurs at their best and, on different tracks, at their most populist¡Xwhich is not always the same thing. "In the Mood" doesn't include the famous swing-era song that inspired the album's title, but it does begin with another landmark hit for the Glenn Miller Orchestra, "Chattanooga Choo Choo." The first sounds we hear on the album are electronically generated beats, which may cause you to assume for a minute that Mr. Alpert has changed the name of his ensemble to the Tijuana Techno. But the famous Harry Warren melody quickly arrives in the form of Mr. Alpert's signature brass sound, and the articulation of said trumpets, though acoustic, suggests that they've been fed into a sampler and played back on a keyboard.

In a recent appearance at the Cafe Carlyle, Mr. Alpert told audiences that his first inspiration as a trumpeter was Ziggy Elman (best known for his work with Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey), a likely role model for an aspiring Jewish trumpeter who grew up during the big band era. But the use of a shuffle-style backbeat on such swing anthems as "Choo Choo," "Begin the Beguine" and "Blue Moon" points to Jonah Jones, who made a series of pop trumpet albums in the late 1950s that set familiar standards to a danceable shuffle beat in a way that could be considered a precedent for the Tijuana Brass a decade later.

Even more than Mr. Alpert's own playing, it was the use of well-crafted arrangements that made the Tijuana Brass such a success 50 years ago, and while he also scored as a vocalist with "This Guy's in Love With You," he's a considerably better singer on his horn, as he shows on "When Sunny Gets Blue," the Nat King Cole-associated standard on the new album. There's no fancy chart here, just Mr. Alpert playing Marvin Fisher's melody with much obvious love, delineating it deliberately and meaningfully. It's the most exposed and vulnerable Mr. Alpert has ever sounded on record.

Mr. Mendes's "Magic" proves that his music has been, since his first album in the early '60s, a kind of musical feijoada, a Brazilian stew, in which the basic ingredient, the soup stock as it were, is Mr. Mendes's familiar samba beat. Over this basic beat he's consistently added a mix of fresh ingredients that fit the era, like jazz solos and well-known pop hits (Paul Simon, the Beatles) in the 1960s, a heavier funk beat in the '70s and, now on one track on the current album ("My My My My Love," featuring Cody Wise and produced by rap star will.i.am), autotune-adjusted synthesized vocals in the 21st-century style. John Legend's guest shot on "Don't Say Goodbye" shows how perfect the Mendes sound is for backing up a wide range of celebrity singers, from Eartha Kitt and Tom Jones in the early years of the Brasil bands to, more recently, the hip-hop stars the Black Eyed Peas.

The tracks with Brazilian guests, however, fall more into line with Mr. Mendes's classic early ensembles, and are overall the album's most successful.

Baritone Seu Jorge evokes both romance and a party atmosphere, whether singing or speaking, on "Sou Eu," a South American standard by composer Moacir Santos, whom Wynton Marsalis has dubbed "The Duke Ellington of Brazil." The beats on Milton Nascimento's "Olha a Rua" (with a vocal by the composer) and "One Nation," co-written by Mr. Mendes and guest vocalist Carlinhos Brown, both split the difference between dancing and parading down the street during Carnival. Deep-voiced Ana Carolina delivers the most sensual vocal of the set on "Atlantica"; Mika Mutti follows her with beautifully vocalized harmonica lines that turn the number into a virtual love duet, and then, when Mr. Mendes begins singing with the two of them, it becomes a m?nage ? trois. "Meu Rio," with a vocal by Maria Gadu, adds strings to the mix in the form of a solo cello and percussion in the form of handclaps, which suggests flamenco.

Mr. Mendes's voyage is mainly geographic, covering South and North America, the old world and the new; Mr. Alpert's is temporal, as he conjoins the big band era with both the Brill Building period ("All I Have to Do Is Dream," "Spanish Harlem" from the early 1960s) and the contemporary era. If the vitality of the best tracks on both of these albums is any indication, both of these musical journeys are far from complete.

FCC Considers Regulations for Web-Video Services; Cable-Like Subscriptions Could Get Protections, but Also Obligations

The Federal Communications Commission is considering regulations for companies that provide cable-like subscription video services via the Internet, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.

The move could have major implications for companies such as Sony Corp., Dish Network Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc., all of which are planning to launch online video services¡Xoften called over-the-top, or OTT¡Xaimed at consumers who don't have traditional pay-TV subscriptions.

At issue is whether such online providers should be regulated in the same manner that the FCC currently regulates traditional cable and satellite companies, or "multichannel video program distributors."

If the FCC adopts such regulations, it would mean that an online provider would have the same ability to negotiate for carriage of local broadcast TV stations that cable and satellite TV providers have. It could also make it harder for a distributor that owns TV channels¡Xsuch as Comcast Corp.¡Xto refuse to license them to an online service.

Still, there are many issues that need to be worked out with regards to how OTT companies would be regulated and whether they would face the same franchise fees and taxes as traditional video providers and have the same public interest obligations such as providing closed captioning for programming.

An FCC spokesperson declined to comment.

This proceeding wouldn't apply to streaming services from Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Hulu LLC, as they don't carry traditional TV channels but instead offer content on-demand.

The FCC initially launched a rule-making proceeding regarding the regulation of subscription online video services in 2012 after a Web programmer, Sky Angel LLC, filed a complaint about Discovery Communications Inc. Sky Angel charged that Discovery pulled out of a deal to offer programming to the online service in violation of the FCC's program access rules. The FCC tentatively sided with Discovery, saying Sky Angel didn't meet the requirements to be classified like a cable or satellite company because it didn't own or control its distribution facilities.

The rule-making process went dormant, but the FCC is now reviving it. "The fact that they are resurrecting it is some indication that they are taking it seriously" that online cable operators are bringing services to market, said media analyst Craig Moffett.

The media industry in the past has been split on the issue of how to regulate Web-based services. Comcast argued against regulating them in 2012, in part, the company said, because the industry is still growing and would be hampered by having to meet all the regulatory requirements of cable operators.

But satellite broadcaster DirecTV countered that if an online video player is going to act like a cable or satellite company, it should be regulated the same way.

N.Y. Film Fest 'the Holy Grail' for 'Whiplash' Director

After showing at Sundance, Cannes and Toronto, the new movie "Whiplash"¡Xout Oct. 10 from Sony Pictures Classics¡Xscreened at the New York Film Festival on Sunday night.

The area festival "is kind of like the Holy Grail," said the film's 29-year-old writer and director Damien Chazelle, who grew up in Princeton, N.J., reading about films showing there.

"I couldn't afford tickets," he added, at a dinner before the premiere at the restaurant Smith.

"Whiplash," a kind of "Black Swan" for the jazz-drumming set, is based on Mr. Chazelle's experiences at Princeton High School, which had a particularly competitive and nationally renowned jazz band. In the film, which is at times harrowing and at times comic, Miles Teller plays a first-year drummer at a New York City conservatory dealing with the pressures foisted on him by an aggressive, abusive and passionate music teacher, played by the character actor J.K. Simmons.

Downtown Los Angeles substituted for much of New York during filming, Mr. Chazelle said. "We were able to get enough budget to shoot in New York for an afternoon," including Carnegie Hall, but downtown L.A., he said, "helped paint a portrait less of what New York City is now than a child's nightmare view of a '70s New York."

To conjure excitement for a full-length film, Mr. Chazelle originally made a 20-minute short on a $25,000 budget, which showed at last year's New York Film Festival. For the short, Jason Reitman, one of the producers of "Whiplash," suggested Mr. Simmons, who had starred in Mr. Reitman's "Juno."

When raising money for the feature, financiers suggested actors like Kevin Kline, Kevin Spacey or Jeff Daniels for the role, said Mr. Chazelle. The director demurred and now Mr. Simmons has one of the most buzzed-about performances of the fall film season.

After the screening, Mr. Chazelle was asked exactly how key a drummer is to a jazz band. "Well, not really at all," he said. "But conductors have a special thing about drummers."

What they do might not look very hard, he said, "but without the drum, the whole band collapses."

BREAKINGVIEWS- SoftBank and Shrek may lack on-screen chemistry

HONG KONG, Sept 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - SoftBank's acquisition strategy is nothing if not animated, but it's not always easy to see a clear plot. The Japanese conglomerate's next move could be a bid for DreamWorks Animation worth $3.4 billion, according to The Hollywood Reporter. SoftBank's giant balance sheet could easily absorb the hit and miss earnings of film production. Yet with each big buy, it becomes less clear how the group's parts fit together.

Compared with abortive plans earlier this year to bid for U.S. mobile carrier T-Mobile, a tilt at the studio that created titles like "Shrek" and "Madagascar" looks tiny. But it adds to a series of modestly sized deals in content, including its recent consolidation of the world's top two mobile games companies, Supercell and GungHo Online Entertainment. Talks for Vivendi's Universal Music were mooted last year but came to naught.

DreamWorks Animation's biggest challenge as a listed company has been lumpy earnings, thanks to a hit-and-miss pipeline of films. While "Shrek" wowed, last year's "Turbo" was a flop. That's where SoftBank's sheer size could be an advantage. The reported price tag implies a premium of around one-fifth to the animation house's current enterprise value, using a broad interpretation of debt. Yet based on Eikon forecasts for the current financial year, DreamWorks Animation's net loss would be less than 0.1 percent of SoftBank's earnings.

SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son is a proven dealmaker - he arranged a $20 million investment in Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba that is now worth $71 billion. That suggests investors would be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. That's a good job: fellow Japanese tech giant Sony took a multi-billion writedown on its 1989 purchase of Columbia Pictures.

Explaining the storyline to investors still needs thought. SoftBank is relatively highly geared for a Japanese company at 3.1 times net debt to EBITDA, based on annualised earnings for the first quarter. And it already has a collection of more than 1,300 stakes in companies varying from video streaming platforms to U.S mobile carrier Sprint. Alibaba proved a good bet, but at some point Son will have to more clearly explain his vision for what distinguishes a smash hit from a rotten tomato.

'Equalizer' Takes Top Spot; Action Film Starring Denzel Washington Beats Out Holdover 'The Maze Runner'

"The Equalizer" topped the box office with an estimated $35 million debut, giving star Denzel Washington another strong weekend opening.

Based on the 1980s television show of the same name, "The Equalizer" features Mr. Washington as a vigilante who comes out of retirement to help save a young woman in trouble with the Russian mob. The action movie was directed by Antoine Fuqua, who teamed with Mr. Washington on his Oscar-winning role in 2001's "Training Day."

Holdover "The Maze Runner," from Twentieth Century Fox, landed in second place, grossing $17.5 million for a two-week total of $58 million.

Trailing close behind was the weekend's other new release, "The Boxtrolls," which arrived in third place with $17.3 million. It is a company best for the Laika animation studio that made the family film; its most successful movie to date, "Coraline" opened to $16.8 million in 2009 and went on to gross $75.3 million. Laika is owned by Nike Inc. Chairman Phil Knight. "The Boxtrolls" features the voices of Ben Kingsley and Elle Fanning in a story about an orphan raised by trash-collecting trolls. It was distributed by Focus Features, a specialty division of Comcast Corp.'s Universal Pictures.

"The Boxtrolls" was the first animated film to hit theaters since July's "Planes: Fire and Rescue," and won't face competition again from family fare until "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day" is released on Oct. 10.

The opening performance of "The Equalizer" puts the film in the territory of 2012's "Safe House," which also starred Mr. Washington and opened to $40.2 million before grossing $126.4 million. "The Equalizer," co-financed by Village Roadshow Pictures with a budget of $55 million, was distributed by Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures.

Audiences gave the film an A- grade, according to the CinemaScore market research firm. "The Boxtrolls" received a B+.

Of last week's new releases, "This Is Where I Leave You," with Tina Fey and Jason Bateman, held on strongest, falling 39% for a weekend gross of $7 million. Liam Neeson's thriller "A Walk Among the Tombstones" appears to have been hurt by the arrival of Mr. Washington's latest action-hero turn; it plummeted 67% to gross $4.2 million in seventh place.

Fox's parent company, 21st Century Fox, was until mid-2013 part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.

SoftBank Is in Talks With DreamWorks Animation; Japanese Telecom Considers Acquisition, Investment in Studio After Dropping T-Mobile Pursuit

SoftBank Corp. is in talks to buy or otherwise link up with DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., people familiar with the negotiations said, a deal that could help the Japanese company and the Hollywood studio as they seek new ways to compete with rivals world-wide.

Coming nearly two months after SoftBank dropped a possible bid for T-Mobile US Inc., a DreamWorks Animation deal could give the conglomerate's Sprint Corp. unit another way to try to challenge top U.S. mobile carriers AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.

Rather than directly expand his telecommunications network, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son now appears to be focusing more on acquiring content creators, mostly videogame studios so far, whose products can be used to woo potential mobile subscribers.

Mr. Son early last month decided against bidding for T-Mobile, the fourth-largest U.S. cellular operator, and combining it with No. 3 Sprint, amid antitrust concerns in Washington.

SoftBank is well positioned for acquisitions in part because of billions of dollars in paper gains from the recent initial public offering of Chinese Internet company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., of which SoftBank owns 32%.

The people familiar with the talks declined to disclose a possible price for DreamWorks Animation, the market value of which is about $2 billion. One of the people said the talks were in the early stages and could lead to a distribution partnership or a SoftBank investment in DreamWorks, rather than an outright purchase. The talks were reported Saturday evening by the Hollywood Reporter.

DreamWorks Animation has long struggled as a relatively small, publicly traded movie studio and being absorbed by a conglomerate like SoftBank could shield the studio from investor pressure. The U.S. company's stock tends to rise or fall based on individual movies' financial performance, and a string of recent disappointments has cut the company's share price almost in half since 2010.

The studio has released some of the biggest hits in animation history, including the "Shrek" and "Madagascar" films. But more recent titles, such as "Rise of the Guardians" and "Turbo," have been much less successful.

CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has been touting a strategy to reduce his company's reliance on the two or three feature films it makes each year by expanding into television, online video and consumer products. But given DreamWorks Animation's modest size it would be nearly impossible to build a global infrastructure that could compete meaningfully with the theme parks, television networks and consumer-products division owned by big companies like Walt Disney Co.

DreamWorks Animation also faces competition from smaller, nimbler rivals, such as "Ice Age" producer Blue Sky Studios Inc. and "Despicable Me" creator Illumination Entertainment. Those closely held studios' success at the box office, often with movies that cost less than DreamWorks productions, have put pressure on Mr. Katzenberg to reduce his studio's costs.

A deal with SoftBank would help the Glendale, Calif., studio expand in the fast-growing Asia market. Two years ago, DreamWorks Animation joined several Chinese investment companies to set up a studio in China to create animated and action films for global audiences.

Though DreamWorks Animation is a small studio, it has a high profile because it is headed by Mr. Katzenberg, who founded the broader DreamWorks SKG studio with former music executive David Geffen and movie director Steven Spielberg. The animation studio spun off in 2004.

DreamWorks Animation reported a second-quarter net loss of $15.4 million on revenue of $122.3 million. The company's movies are released through the Twentieth Century Fox unit of 21st Century Fox, which until last year was part of the same company as The Wall Street Journal.

With his pursuit of DreamWorks Animation, Mr. Son becomes the first prominent Japanese investor to pursue Hollywood since a quarter-century ago, when Japanese electronics companies snapped up studio assets.

He has said he wants to make SoftBank the biggest company in the world and recently told investors that he intended to increase its market value to ?200 trillion, or nearly $2 trillion, by 2040 from just shy of ?10 trillion today.

The Tokyo-based company this month bolstered its war chest for expansion with the Alibaba IPO. SoftBank's stake cost about $20 million 14 years ago and now is valued at roughly $71 billion.

Mr. Son is said to keep a whiteboard in his office with an ever-changing list of possible deals. SoftBank already has investments in more than 1,300 companies.

"Content, media and Internet businesses in the U.S., which they can expand globally, should be the main target for SoftBank," said Satoru Kikuchi, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. Because SoftBank already has network infrastructure, it can "leverage it with content businesses."

In recent months, reports have linked SoftBank to a range of potential targets, including U.S.-based Internet company Yahoo Inc., British mobile operator Vodafone Group PLC, Mexican wireless carrier Grupo Iusacell SA de CV and Line Corp., the Japanese operator of a fast-growing mobile messaging service. SoftBank already owns a stake in Yahoo Japan Corp.

But business associates of Mr. Son say he remains attracted to the growth potential of the U.S. despite the T-Mobile setback. He wants to expand SoftBank's media content, seeing that as a way to expand by giving SoftBank's mobile networks a competitive edge, they say.

To expand digital content, SoftBank in July hired Nikesh Arora, one of the driving forces behind the growth of Google Inc.'s lucrative search advertising business. The discussions between SoftBank and DreamWorks Animation began advancing with his arrival, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Son has met with Mr. Katzenberg, though Mr. Arora has been leading the talks, the person said.

SoftBank last month acquired control of Supercell Oy, a Finland-based mobile-game company that created titles such as "Clash of Clans.'' SoftBank also owns a controlling sake in Japan's GungHo Online Entertainment Inc., the developer of "Puzzle & Dragons." Such investments have made SoftBank the top-grossing provider of mobile-game applications for smartphones world-wide, according to research firm App Annie.

Yet efforts by telecoms and media companies to bring content and distribution under the same roof often have failed to live up to expectations. France's Vivendi SA in 2004 sold control of its Hollywood assets to General Electric Co., only four years after acquiring them. And Japan's Sony Corp. has struggled to reap the benefits of owning electronics and entertainment arms.

Mr. Son's Hollywood dreams recall Japanese deals in the movie industry in the late 1980s by Sony and others.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Denzel Washington may be the most consistent hitter in Hollywood.               

The Oscar-winning actor steers clear of blockbuster fare and superhero pics, but his name above the title is gold when it comes to bringing in adult crowds to his thrillers and dramas. His latest, "The Equalizer," hits theaters this weekend and should bring in between $28 million and $30 million. Produced by Sony Pictures and Village Roadshow for $55 million, "The Equalizer" will unspool across 3,234 locations. The studio says it will be happy with a debut in the mid-to-high $20 million range.               

"Denzel Washington doesn't miss," said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. "He's one of the last foolproof actors working. He hasn't really had any bombs."               

Indeed, no film starring Washington has opened to less than $20 million since 2003's "Out of Time." Over the course of his career, his films have brought in an impressive $2.1 billion, in addition to a pair of Academy Awards. Washington has gotten there without the benefit of a franchise.               

Sony hopes that's about to change and that the film will spark a new action series. "The Equalizer" reunites the "Training Day" team of Washington and director Antoine Fuqua, which will help stoke audience enthusiasm. The gritty, hard-R thriller is a very loose adaptation of the CBS show about an urbane crime-fighting Brit - it keeps the vigilantism and special ops past and ups the violence. It pits Robert McCall (Washington) against Russian mobsters with a propensity for tattooing and brutality. Come for Washington, stick around to discover creative and violent uses for power drills and corkscrews.               

"The Equalizer" will head off against another wide release aimed at a very different audience, "The Boxtrolls." The stop-motion animated film arrives courtesy of Laika, the Oregon-based creators of "Paranorman" and "Coraline." Focus Features is distributing the films across 3,464 locations in 3D and 2D and should pick up between $15 million and $16 million. The film centers on a young boy raised by trolls and features the voices of Ben Kingsley, Elle Fanning and Tracy Morgan.               

Analysts say there's a cap to the number of tickets this kind of animated feature can sell, noting that films such as "Coraline" or "The Nightmare Before Christmas" are more specialty attractions than broad crowd-pleasers.               

"Fans of stop motion are more cinephiles and that doesn't always translate into really big box office," said Jeff Bock, an analyst at Exhibitor Relations. "Even though there hasn't been a new animated film in the marketplace for two months, there's a limit to the audience that it can reach."               

Last weekend's champ "The Maze Runner" should have a respectable hold on audience attention thanks to positive word-of-mouth. In its sophomore weekend, look for the young adult thriller to possibly top "Boxtrolls" with $16 million. Holdovers "This Is Where I Leave You" and "Walk Among the Tombstones" will likely pull in $6 million in their second weekends of release.               

Among limited releases, CBS Films will roll out the gay and labor rights dramedy "Pride" in six theaters in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.               

Overall, the domestic box office will have a tough time matching the $108 million racked up over the same weekend in 2013, when "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2" bowed to $34 million and "Baggage Claim" and "Don John" also hit theaters. However, analysts say that the range of product coming into theaters is a good sign for a business trying to shake off one of the worst summer box office periods in more than a decade.

GameStop Plans to Increase Holiday Hiring; Videogame Retailer Points to Preparation for New Game Sales

GameStop Corp. plans to hire about 25,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season, an increase of 47% from last year.

The videogame retailer said it plans to hire seasonal "game advisers," 250 consumer electronics technicians for its refurbishment operation center and warehouse personnel for its distribution centers.

Part of the reason for the stepped-up hiring plans includes preparation for new games for Microsoft's Xbox One, the Nintendo Wii U and Sony's PlayStation 4.

GameStop also expects to see demand from consumers who want to trade-in their older smartphones and trade up to Apple's iPhone 6.

The introduction of updated versions of the Xbox and Playstation have bolstered GameStop's results recently.

During August the retailer reported its second-quarter profit nearly doubled thanks to booming demand for the new videogame consoles, which more than doubled GameStop's hardware sales for the period. New games for the consoles drove software sales, which rose nearly 16%.

Retailers typically hire temporary, part-time staff to help handle the higher traffic that occurs during the holidays.

HHGregg Inc. said Thursday that it plans to hire more than 450 sales associates for the holiday season, down from 500 last year.

Toys "R" Us and Target Corp. have both disclosed plans to hire the same number of employees as last year, while Kohl's Corp. plans to hire 67,000 workers, up from 50,000 a year ago.

UPDATE 2-Nanoco, Dow Chemical to launch quantum dot production

* Commercial production expected to start in first half 2015

* Plant to produce cadmium-free quantum dots in South Korea

* Demand from display makers seen rising

* Nanoco shares rise more than 27 pct (Adds details, analyst comment, background; updates shares)

By Aashika Jain and Roshni Menon

Sept 24 (Reuters) - Nanoco Group Plc said commercial production of quantum dots, used to make vibrant screen displays, is expected to begin in the first half of next year at a plant in South Korea being built by its partner, Dow Chemical Co.

Shares of the British nanotechnology company rose more than 27 percent on Wednesday to their highest in more than 10 months.

The launch of quantum dot production, which analysts said was probably linked to a supply agreement with a big display manufacturer, signals a major breakthrough for Nanoco and the quantum dot industry.

"Nanoco is today on the threshold of major growth in its revenues, earnings and cash flows," Liberum analysts Eoin Lambe and Janardan Menon wrote in a note.

Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals, 10,000 times finer than a human hair, that can convert electrical energy into light and be manipulated to produce precise colors for display.

They are cheaper and consume less power than organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), their rival technology at the sharp end of the display business, but cannot yet be produced in the same quantities.

With demand expected to soar, the handful of companies able to make quantum dots are partnering with big display makers to set up industrial-scale manufacturing.

Dow Chemical, which holds exclusive worldwide rights to sell Nanoco's quantum dots for use in electronic displays, said on Wednesday it would begin construction of the manufacturing plant in Cheonan, South Korea.

Unlike those produced by competitors, quantum dots using Nanoco's technology do not contain cadmium, a toxic metal, the use of which is restricted in many countries. Cheonan will be the world's first large-scale, cadmium-free quantum dot plant.

'MILLIONS OF TELEVISIONS'

Quantum dots are already in use. Amazon.com Inc's Kindle Fire HDX 7 and Sony Corp's Triluminos TV, for example, already use them in their screens.

It is their wider adoption in television screens as a much cheaper alternative to OLED technology that promises growth.

Touch Display Research, a market research and consulting firm, forecasts that the global market for quantum dot displays and lighting components will rise to $9.6 billion by 2023 from $508 million in 2014.

Dow Chemical said the new plant would "enable the manufacture of millions of quantum dot televisions and other display applications to meet growing consumer demand."

Analysts at Liberum and Canaccord Genuity said Dow would have been unlikely to build a plant without the commitment of at least one large customer.

Among the largest South Korean display makers, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd declined immediate comment and a spokeswoman for LG Electronics Inc said the company had not decided whether or not to release quantum dot TVs.

For Manchester-based Nanoco, founded in 2001, the start of construction of the plant triggers an unspecified "milestone payment" from Dow. The Liberum and Canaccord analysts estimated this payment at about $2 million.

The Liberum analysts forecast Nanoco's revenue could rise to 51 million pounds ($84 million) by 2017. The company reported revenue of 3.93 million pounds for the year to July 31, 2013. The company has yet to turn a profit since listing in May 2009.

Nanoco's shares were up 25.4 percent at 148.3 pence at 1023 GMT. ($1 = 0.6097 British pound) (Additional reporting by Se Young Lee in Seoul; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Robin Paxton)

New Hollywood Studio Gets a Chinese Engine; Robinov Startup Gets $200 Million From Fosun, Looks to China for Growth

Hollywood studios have spent more than a decade working their way into China past government quotas, censors, and ever-changing regulations. Now one of China's largest conglomerates has found its way into Hollywood through simpler means: an enormous check.

Fosun Group is investing about $200 million in Studio 8, a startup run by former Warner Bros. film chief Jeff Robinov, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The studio's movies will be distributed by Sony Corp.'s Sony Pictures Entertainment,

Fosun had said back in June that it would team up with Studio 8, but the size of the investment wasn't disclosed. The deal marks the largest investment to date by a Chinese company in American film production.

In their first interview discussing the company, Mr. Robinov and Fosun chairman Guo Guangchang declined to discuss the financing of Studio 8. They said they saw their partnership as an opportunity to design an American company while keeping in mind the fast-growing Chinese box office, currently No. 2 in the world and expected to soon become No. 1.

"Hollywood stands at the peak of the global entertainment industry, but everybody should be looking at China for growth in the future," said Mr. Guo before a party on the Sony lot Tuesday night introducing him to Hollywood.

Sony is investing an additional $50 million into Studio 8, which is also finalizing a credit facility of at least $300 million, said the people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Robinov said he intends to make movies at different budget levels aimed at the global market. Studio 8 has a five-year deal that calls for Sony to release 24 of its productions. Its first release will likely hit theaters in 2016.

With Studio 8, Fosun is making one of Hollywood's riskiest bets: Backing a company that will develop a new slate of films with no intellectual property to adapt and no library of older titles to produce stable cash flow. The company's success will rest entirely on its ability to quickly develop and produce movies appealing to world-wide audiences that have flocked to movies like "The Avengers" and the fourth "Transformers," but without having any superhero comics to adapt or prior hits from which it can make sequels.

"Entrepreneurship is always hard, but¡KI fully trust the team Jeff has assembled," said Mr. Guo.

Mr. Robinov is respected in Hollywood, particularly for the filmmaker relationships he developed during his 16 year-run as an executive at Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros.

"The kind of global, muscular movies Jeff has been making are the kind of movies we want," said Sony movie chief Amy Pascal, citing several of Mr. Robinov's biggest hits at Warner, including "Inception," "Gravity," and "The Hangover," all of which were original ideas.

"I do have a very solid sense of what can work in the marketplace... and cut through some of the clutter," said Mr. Robinov. "The trick for us is to take movies that are commercial, but somehow feel different."

But others have struggled with the same model Studio 8 is pursuing.

Soon after DreamWorks SKG was relaunched by Steven Spielberg and former Universal Pictures chairman Stacey Snider in 2009, it fell into a financial hole after it released several high-profile flops. It still hasn't found its footing.

Sony, like most studios, is cutting back on internal production. This deal gives it more movies to release through its world-wide distribution and marketing operation, which carries a sizable overhead. Sony will get between 8% and 10% of the revenue generated by Studio 8 movies, according to knowledgeable people, on the low end of what is typical for such arrangements in Hollywood.

Fosun, which has compared itself to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, has insurance assets at its core but has also put money into banking, real estate and mines and recently made an unsuccessful run at Forbes magazine.

Its only other significant entertainment investment is a 21% stake in Bona Film Group, a Chinese distributor. Bona won't necessarily release Studio 8 movies, Mr. Guo said, and Fosun won't necessarily be able to get the pictures into one of China's 34 allotted annual slots for foreign movies that want to receive up to 25% of box office revenue, as opposed to a small flat fee. However, the relationship could provide advantages.

"Because of our support, they will be a big success in China," predicted Mr. Guo.

Chinese companies are aiming to boost their own filmmaking skills. While the country's consumers appear to have a voracious appetite for movies, its domestic productions haven't found global success.

"What better way to learn from Hollywood than to buy into it?" said Matthew Alderson, the head of law firm Harris & Mourre LLC's Chinese media practice.

Investments in movies can also be good branding exercises for Chinese companies looking to expand overseas, said Lora Chen, president at California-based consultancy China Media Consulting.

Chinese entertainment company Huayi Brothers Media Corp., which at one point planned to invest in Studio 8, recently said it would spend $130 million to create a U.S. subsidiary that will produce and distribute movies and television shows.

Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group Corp., which owns U.S. theater chain AMC Entertainment Group, is setting up a base for entertainment investments as part of a $1.2 billion real-estate development in Los Angeles.

Mr. Robinov left Warner last year after he lost a three-way race to become the film and television studio's chief executive and had a falling out with Kevin Tsujihara, who got the job in his stead.

Even before finalizing financial arrangements for Studio 8, he had been looking to re-establish his position as one of Hollywood's premier moguls.

"Jeff has been meeting with a bunch of agents, producers and talent to say, 'I'm in business and want to be the patriarch of your movies,'" said one talent agent.

'Godzilla' Beats 'Fault in Our Stars' in DVD Sales

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The flood of high-profile new releases continues, with new Blu-ray Discs and DVDs accounting for seven of the top 10 sellers on Nielsen VideoScan's weekly overall disc sales chart for the week ending Sept. 21.               

At the top: Warner's "Godzilla" remake-of-a-remake-of-a-remake, which easily debuted at No. 1 on both the First Alert chart, which tracks combined Blu-ray Disc and DVD sales, and Nielsen's dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart.               

The summer theatrical blockbuster grossed more than $200 million in U.S. theaters, nearly 50% more than Sony Pictures' 1998 retelling of the classic horror story of a giant dinosaur wreaking havoc on modern civilization.               

Coming in at No. 2, also on both charts, was 20th Century Fox's "The Fault in Our Stars," a romantic drama that earned $124.8 million in theaters. The film, which boasts a cast of young stars familiar to teens through movies like "Divergent," sold 82.8% as many units as "Godzilla" its first week in stores, according to Nielsen data. Looking at Blu-ray Disc sales only, "Fault" sold just 56% as many units, which isn't surprising given that "Godzilla" generated 58% of its total sales from the high-definition version, to just 39% for "Fault."               

Walt Disney Studios' "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," which debuted at No. 1 the previous week, slipped to No. 3 on both charts, followed by two more high-ranking newcomers: season seven of the hot TV series "The Big Bang Theory," from Warner, which bowed at No. 4, and the Sony Pictures comedy "Think Like a Man Too," a sequel with a domestic box office gross of $65.2 million, entering the chart at No.5.               

On the overall disc chart, "Barbie and the Secret Door," Universal Studios' latest direct-to-video movie starring the iconic Mattel doll, debuted at No. 6, followed by Walt Disney's "Frozen" at No. 7, the same position it held the prior week.               

Rounding out the First Alert top 10 were the 20th Century Fox crime drama "Brick Mansions" at No. 8, down from its No. 2 debut the previous week, and two more new releases: "Castle: The Complete Sixth Season," from Walt Disney Studios, at No. 9, and "Arrow: The Complete Second Season," from Warner, at No. 10.               

On Home Media Magazine's rental chart for the week, "Think Like a Man Too" was the highest-ranking new release, debuting at No. 2. Sony Pictures is one of three major studios that distributes its new releases immediately to all retailers, including Netflix and Redbox, instead of waiting 28 days as the other three majors do.               

"Captain America: The Winter Soldier" soared up to No. 1 after debuting at No. 7 the previous week.               

Lionsgate's "Draft Day" slipped to No. 3 from No. 2, while the previous week's top rental, 20th Century Fox's "The Other Woman," slid to No. 4. Rounding out the top five was "Moms' Night Out," from Sony Pictures, down a notch from No. 4 the prior week.               

Thomas K. Arnold is editorial director of Home Media Magazine.

Microsoft Xbox One set to launch in China on September 29

BEIJING (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has set Sept. 29 as the new launch date for its Xbox One game console in China, the U.S. software giant said on Tuesday, in the first launch since a 14-year ban on sales of foreign games consoles was lifted this year.

The world's biggest software company gave no reason for the delay in the launch which was originally scheduled for Sept. 23.

The delay is the latest in a series of setbacks for Microsoft in China, where it is under investigation for suspected anti-trust violations related to the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office.

"We take great care to ensure that we meet or exceed regulatory standards," said Microsoft in an e-mail to Reuters in response to the delayed console launch.

The Xbox One console will cost 3,699 yuan ($602.76) without the Kinect motion detection system and 4,299 yuan ($700.53) with Kinect, Microsoft said.

China is the world's third-biggest gaming market where revenues grew by more than a third from 2012 to nearly $14 billion last year.

Console games must also get approval from Shanghai's local culture department, which will ensure they do not harm China's national unity, territorial integrity or reputation - or promote racial hatred, obscenity, gambling, violence or drugs. This could stop some of video games' biggest franchises, such as Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty, from being published in China.

"After receiving government approval for the first wave of games, we've decided to launch with digital copies of the first 10 games now and will continue our work to bring more blockbuster games and a broad offering of entertainment and app experiences to the platform in the months to come," Enwei Xie, Microsoft's general manager for Xbox China, said in a press release.

In May, Sony Corp) said it would set up a joint venture with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group to bring the PlayStation games console to China.

Microsoft makes the Xbox One console with Chinese internet TV set-top box maker BesTV New Media Co Ltd.

(Reuters) - Sony Corp said PlayStation TV set-top box, which allows users to access movies and TV episodes from the PlayStation store, will hit stores in the United States and Canada on Oct. 14.

The price for a standalone PlayStation TV (PS TV) is $99.99, the company wrote in a blog. For $139.99, customers can get a wireless controller, an 8 GB memory card and "The Lego Movie" videogame along with the PS TV.

Around 700 games will be available to PS TV users, including "Metal Gear Solid" and the franchise "Killzone: Mercenary".

PS TV was released in Japan and other Asian countries under the name "PlayStation Vita TV" last fall. Sony is trying to expand its entertainment network services to compete against players like Amazon.com Inc.

Sony did not say when it will launch its online TV service.

The company signed a deal earlier this month to carry 22 Viacom Inc channels, including Comedy Central and MTV, on its planned online TV.

PlayStation boss Shaun Layden told tech blog Re/code in June the company was "on track" to unveil its product some time this year.

Sony's web TV service will join the ranks of an already crowded market with devices from Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Roku.

MGM Buys 55% of Mark Burnett Ventures; Reality-Show Producer Sought Partner to Fuel Growth

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. acquired a 55% stake in "Survivor" producer Mark Burnett's various television and film production ventures, folding them into its storied but dormant United Artists banner.

The studio behind "The Hobbit," the James Bond series and "RoboCop," paid about $400 million for the assets, said people familiar with the matter. MGM is controlled by a group of hedge funds led by Anchorage Capital Group LLC.

The deal's structure is complex. MGM is investing in both One Three Media, a joint venture between Mr. Burnett and Hearst Corp. that produced unscripted shows like "The Voice," and LightWorkers Media, Mr. Burnett's venture with his wife, Roma Downey, which has produced scripted fare like "The Bible."

Mr. Burnett, a British-American producer, is widely credited with popularizing the reality-television genre with "Survivor" well over a decade ago and remains one of the most prolific producers on TV. As part of the transaction, MGM is also acquiring interests in unscripted shows Mr. Burnett produced, such as "Survivor," "Shark Tank," and "The Apprentice."

The investment caps several months of talks between Mr. Burnett's businesses and Hollywood studios, as the producer hunted for more money to fuel the growth of his television empire. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Mr. Burnett was looking to sell a stake in One Three Media, three years after he formed his 50-50 joint venture with Hearst.

"This started with Mark calling me with this idea that we ought to be open to¡Xand to look for¡Xa partner who could help us grow faster, get us into new formats, get us into new markets, new countries and new ideas," Steven Swartz, Hearst's CEO, said in an interview.

MGM's investment comes as studios are increasingly betting on television for growth to offset their slower growing, lower-margin movie business. Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures launched a television division last year, while Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton has said he is putting more emphasis on his company's television business than movies.

The new United Artists Media Group will make content across all platforms, including scripted and non-scripted television programs, movies and digital content, with Mr. Burnett serving as CEO.

The venture will also launch a streaming online video channel aimed at religious audiences featuring Christian music videos, sermons from religious leaders and short user-generated religious videos.

"We think they are unparalleled in this arena," said Gary Barber, MGM's chief executive.

Launched in 1919 by Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith, United Artists has been though a number of incarnations, particularly since it was acquired by MGM in the early 1980s. Most recently, a prior management team in 2006 gave Tom Cruise and his production partner Paula Wagner a 30% stake in UA and control of the division.

But the duo released only two films, the flop "Lions for Lambs" and modest success "Valkyrie," before departing. After MGM emerged from bankruptcy in late 2010, it bought back full control of United Artists, but has done nothing with the brand until now.

'Maze Runner' speeds past Neeson's 'Tombstones' at box office

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dystopian young adult movie "The Maze Runner" won the weekend box office race in the United States and Canada, collecting $32.5 million in ticket sales to outpace the Liam Neeson action flick, "A Walk Among the Tombstones."

Neeson's film earned $13.1 million from Friday through Sunday and finished in second place, according to estimates from tracking firm Rentrak. Comedy "This is Where I Leave You" landed in the No. 3 slot with $11.9 million at domestic theaters.

"Maze Runner" fell slightly short projections for a start of $34 million, the forecast of Box Office Mojo.

The movie stars MTV "Teen Wolf" heartthrob Dylan O'Brien as one of a group of boys living in an isolated paradise where they are trapped by a giant, moving concrete maze. The movie, based on the first novel in a series written by James Dashner, is an attempt to capture the young adult audience that has propelled blockbusters like "The Hunger Games" and "Twilight."

"Maze Runner" opened overseas on Sept. 11, and global sales through Sunday totaled $81.5 million, distributor 20th Century Fox said. The film cost $30 million to make.

Chris Aronson, 20th Century Fox's president of domestic distribution, declared the film "a bona fide home run."

"When you give audiences a film that they want and they like, it's going to do well," said Aronson.

He confirmed that a sequel is in the works. "The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials" is set to open in September of 2015.

In "Walk Among the Tombstones," Neeson plays a private investigator hired by a drug kingpin to find out who murdered his wife. Neeson has earned success as an action star in recent hits "Non-Stop" and "Taken 2." "Tombstones" cost $28 million to make, according to Box Office Mojo.

"This is Where I Leave You," produced for about $20 million, features Tina Fey and Jason Bateman in the story of four grown siblings forced to live together for a week after their father dies.

Last weekend's winner, home invasion thriller "No Good Deed," fell to fourth place, grossing $10.2 million and bringing its total to $40.1 million. Family film "Dolphin Tale 2" took the No. 5 slot with $9 million in its second weekend.

"The Maze Runner" was released by 20th Century Fox, a unit of 21st Century Fox. "Walk Among the Tombstones" was distributed in the United States by Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast Corp and in Canada by Entertainment One Group. "This is Where I Leave You" and "Dolphin Tale 2" were released by Warner Bros, a unit of Time Warner Inc.

Sony Corp's movie studio released "No Good Deed."

Why Taylor Swift and One Direction Play for Peanuts; At iHeartRadio Festival This Weekend, Artists Look to Promote New Songs

The iHeartRadio Music Festival is expected to draw at least 20,000 fans to Las Vegas this weekend, and millions of viewers when it is streamed online and later broadcast on TV¡Xbut it won't be much of a payday for the headliners, including Taylor Swift and One Direction.

That's because most artists are willing to perform for next to nothing. They choose to forgo a big paycheck in exchange for a media blitz, hoping that the radio giant that runs the festival, iHeartMedia Inc.¡Xknown until this week as Clear Channel¡Xwill keep playing their songs on its 800-plus stations.

DJ Steve Aoki canceled three European shows, giving up about $500,000, in order to perform his song "Born to Get Wild" with the artist Will.i.am at the festival, according to a person familiar with the matter. IHeartMedia is paying Mr. Aoki a small fee to help with his expenses, but the amount doesn't come close to covering his travel costs, this person said.

Nearly a decade after the major record companies settled charges that they violated federal payola laws¡Xwhich forbid radio stations from playing songs in exchange for payment without disclosing the arrangement on the airwaves¡Xanother, legal method has largely replaced yesterday's pay-for-airplay schemes. One veteran promoter calls it "showola."

Artists have long played for peanuts at radio stations' holiday shows and summer jams to promote their records. But these cut-rate appearances have now become the main currency that record labels and promoters use to convince radio programmers to play their songs. That is, in part, because they have little else of value to offer, as the music industry's promotion budgets have shriveled.

The appearances themselves are becoming more valuable too, as the concert business booms. For example, Ms. Swift grossed an average of $2.2 million per show over the past 36 months, while boy band One Direction grossed an average of $2.6 million, according to Pollstar.

Radio broadcasters, meantime, are becoming increasingly dependent on the extra exposure and income from their live¡Xand now often televised¡Xevents, as radio listeners are increasingly distracted by everything from mobile games to social media, tuning into radio for shorter blocks of time.

In accordance with federal law, iHeartMedia doesn't promise artists or labels airplay in exchange for their appearances. But artists and record labels fear a drop in airtime if they don't agree to perform, managers and label executives say. Artist managers say that they can typically make excuses to get a client out of an obligation with a broadcaster or station once or twice, but declining a third time means risking the possibility that the broadcaster might "bury" the artist's next single in overnight airplay, one manager said.

Many artists and their labels, though, fight for the chance to appear in such shows at a discount while promoting new songs¡Xespecially new televised shows such as the iHeartRadio Music Awards, which drew more than five million viewers for its debut in May.

The televised events offer national exposure that further augments the record and ticket sales generated by that radio play. IHeartMedia has broadcast its holiday Jingle Ball and summer Pool Party events on the CW Network; it plans to televise its second annual country music festival next year as well.

IHeartMedia typically offers to pay for artists' travel expenses to its events, but even that sum is usually a negotiation. iHeartMedia this year offered one headlining act $150,000 to get to the iHeartRadio festival, for example, but the act required double that sum to cover its costs, according to a person familiar with the matter. In the end, the act had its record label negotiate with iHeartMedia so that the label could kick in some of the difference, this person said.

To increase their leverage in the showola economy, some independent radio promoters have started managing artists on the side, so that they can broker performance deals directly with radio stations. Los Angeles magazine Hits, for example, which has a radio promotion arm, currently manages acts including Pentatonix, Airborne Toxic Event and Walk off the Earth. By offering radio stations performances by those artists, Hits can increase its pull when promoting other artists' records to those stations.

Even amid declining music sales, radio has remained a key way for musicians to amass fans, sell concert tickets and merchandise and build brands that help them land marketing deals and corporate sponsors. In the U.S., radio broadcasters have never paid royalties to most performers on airplay, due to a quirk in copyright law, but they did pay hundreds of millions in royalties last year to music publishers and the artists who wrote the songs. IHeartMedia also pays both performers and songwriters digital royalties to play their music on its Internet service, iHeartRadio.

Until recently, electronic music artists were generally unconcerned with making radio-friendly songs, since their main source of income had always been live gigs. But now most of the world's top DJs have started adding catchy melodies and words over their dance beats to get radio play, competing with each other for exposure to drive their live businesses.

Calvin Harris frequently performs or appears at radio events to promote his music, and his competitors are being forced to follow suit, electronic-music artist managers said. A representative for Mr. Harris didn't respond to a request for comment.

Showola illustrates how the new rules governing radio promotion have helped the biggest record companies save money, but haven't diminished their control over the airwaves. The three major labels, Vivendi A's Univeral Music Group, Sony Corp.'s Sony Music Entertainment and Access Industries' Warner Music Group, together distributed all but one of the top 40 singles this week.

About a decade ago, all three companies settled lawsuits brought by New York's then-attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who alleged that they participated in pay-to-play schemes. As part of the settlements, the labels each agreed to install a compliance officer that would vet all promotion expenses and make sure both staff and contractors adhered to a litany of new rules while wining and dining radio employees.

But these labels have retained their leverage with radio, in part because they control the bulk of the acts that headline radio's shows and can help foot their appearance costs.

"You could make a case that things were much better in days of payola," said one artist manager. "Anybody could get on the radio for couple hundred bucks."

Denzel Washington: Not Thinking About Playing Barack Obama

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - At Spain's 62nd San Sebastian to accept a career-achievement Donostia Award and present, alongside Antoine Fuqua, Sony Pictures' fest opener, "The Equalizer," Denzel Washington denied any idea of playing President Barack Obama.

"Barack Obama is a story that hasn't finished yet. It's not something I'm thinking about, and he's busy. said Washinton, dressed casually in a dark grey jacket and looking very young for his 59 years.

"I've played Biko, Malcolm X, I can't play everybody," he added, when asked if he'd like to limn Martin Luther King.

But Washington did set something of a roadmap of future plans. He will not topline "Shovel Ready," a Warner Bros. adaptation of a debut novel by journalist Adam Sterbergh., he said Friday at a San Sebastian press conference.

It's too early to call, he argued when asked by Variety, if he would star in "The Equalizer" sequel. Sony Pictures and Escape Artists are reportedly working on the project. Screenplay is by Richard Wenk, who penned the first Fuqua/Washington "The Equalizer."

"People will decide if I do a 'The Equalizer' sequel, not me," Washington said. "If it's a good script, it's something I'll consider, but I'm not considering it right now, because this one hasn't come out yet," he added.

But Washington and Fuqua are saddling up - literally, in the actor'scase - for a Western, a remake set up at MGM of "The Magnificent Seven." Washington will be taking riding classes from next week, he said. He was quick to point out to Variety, however, that "The Magnificent Seven" in inspired by Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai." and the film Fuqua and he would be channeling more is the Japanese original. "The Magnificent Seven" is a go project, said Fuqua, who is reportedly attached to "Southpaw" at The Weinstein Company." "Seven Samurai" is one of his favorite movies of all time, Fuqua told the Spanish press.

With such a Hollywood heavyweight as Denzel Washington on board, and Fuqua directing, MGM should have no trouble in completing the cast for "The Magnificent Seven." It would mark the third teaming of Washington and Fuqua after their "Training Day," which earned the U.S. actor his second Academy Award after a supporting actor nod for Edward Zwick's "Glory" and his first best actor Oscar.

Sony Pictures' big-screen redo of the '80s hit TV show, with Washington playing McCall, a hero who helps the hopelessly helpless, "The Equalizer" had its European premiere at San Sebastian, where it was respected by most, rather than drawing rapturous applause.

Undeniable, however, is the ability of Fuqua and Washington to work action scenes. The first, after the film's first half hour build, where Washington demonstrates that the corkscrew is a multi-use appliance, which if applied to the lower jaw of a Russian mobster could emerge in his mouth, sparked applause in the audience at San Sebastian press screening.

What the Donostia Award/"The Equalizer" demonstrated very well is the remarkable pulling power and range of Washington, even at a press conference, an actor who moves from straight seriousness to gentle mockery, clowning, confessions, humility and sincerity, all in the space of a few seconds.

Has he taken up Sidney Poitier's mantle? "There is only one Sidney Poitier, and I'm glad to say he's a friend of mine," Washington retorted.

Does he thing Spanish cinema has improved of late? "I'll let Antoine answer. He knows more about movies than I do. But I have a question: what happened to the Spanish basketball team?

Packing a few phrases of Spanish - "Lo siento mucho" - always a winner with Spain's press, Washington soon had San Sebastian press in his pocket.

Among confessions: Theater. "My children are older now so now I've gone back to doing theater, which was my first love. It's where I was trained and where I started my career. So I've played Shakespeare, Julius Caesar, I just finished a play this summer, 'A Raisin in the Sun.' I've also directed two films and directed half a dozen. So I'm moving around more, directing, acting, producing deals, etc. So I'm trying to do a variety of things."

Washington added he was "working to produce but not looking to act in television," saying he is currently developing a play-based TV series, with a broadcaster, though it was too early to go into details. The theater also had a larger number of good roles than cinema, he added.

 Sony  hopes for PlayStation profit boost as smartphones struggle

TOKYO (Reuters) - The head of Sony Corp's PlayStation division hopes to raise its profit outlook for this year, in stark contrast to the Japanese electronics firm's mobile business which has forecast deep losses and sent Sony's stock reeling.

With Sony's three core electronics businesses - the third is imaging - looking increasingly lopsided, the company is having to shrink and restructure in mobile, and focus its growth hopes on image sensors and the 20-year-old PlayStation games console.

Buoyed by strong sales of the latest PlayStation 4 and the rollout of games and content for its network services, Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Andrew House hopes he can again raise the division's profit forecast for the year to end-March. Sony pushed up that forecast in July to 25 billion yen ($230 million) from 20 billion yen.

"We raised our profit prediction and I hope that's a trend we can continue, even within this fiscal year," House told Reuters in an interview on Thursday, adding his unit's profits looked certain to increase next year from this year's levels.

Sony has sold 10.3 million PlayStation 4 consoles as of Sept. 6, almost double the sales of Microsoft Corp's XBox One, and well ahead of the 7.2 million WiiU's sold by Nintendo Co Ltd, according to market research firm VGChartz.

House's upbeat comments came a day after Sony's struggling smartphone division announced a 180 billion yen impairment charge, triggering the company's sixth profit warning in two-and-a-half years. It also said it would not pay a dividend this year - the first such move since its 1958 listing.

SHARES ROCKED

While Sony had warned in July of a potential charge, the axing of the dividend stunned investors and sparked an 8.6 percent drop in Sony shares to 1,940 yen. That ended a 25 percent rally in the share price over the past six weeks as confidence grew in Sony's restructuring plans and its prospects in growth markets such as automotive sensors.

Sony will cut another 1,000 jobs, around 15 percent of its headcount, in its smartphone business, where it's up against fast-growing Chinese manufacturers such as Xiaomi Inc as well as established names such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.

"If the company were to go through further restructuring, it needs cash, so from this perspective it makes sense that the company's not paying dividends," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management.

Sony's move also sparked a surge in the price of insuring its debt against default, with its 5-year credit default swaps rising 40 percent compared with levels prior to the profit warning.

And Standard & Poor's, the only leading credit ratings agency to retain an investment-grade rating on Sony debt, put the company's credit on review for a possible downgrade to junk status. "We believe it will not be easy for Sony to maintain brand recognition and generate stable profitability in this competitive market," S&P said of Sony's smartphone business.

NETWORK SPENDING

The mobile unit's woes will mean greater scrutiny of the PlayStation's profit performance, which has typically been erratic - swerving from steep losses as Sony spent heavily to develop new consoles to strong profits when those consoles reached peak popularity.

Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai - House's predecessor - has said he hopes the PlayStation 4 can recapture the profit levels of the PlayStation 2, the best-selling game console which at its peak earned Sony more than $1 billion in annual operating profit.

While House declined to be drawn on specific numbers, he touted bright profit prospects at the game division, which brings in 10-12 percent of Sony's revenue, and aims to boost monthly revenue per user from services such as online games, which offer a steadier stream of income than one-off purchases of hardware and software.

"I do feel we have a higher opportunity to build a higher ARPU (average revenue per user) than with the PS3, and that should make a very strong profit contribution over the life-cycle," he said.

He warned, however, that profitability of the game division, which had been combined with network services such as streaming video and music as well as games, would be constrained in the near term as Sony needs to invest in its network infrastructure over the next 12-18 months.

He denied there was pressure for the games division to take up the slack for the mobile business, and noted that both Hirai and CFO Kenichiro Yoshida's background in games and networking was favorable for his business.

"Kaz obviously comes out of the games business. He was in that for 10 years in the States and has a deep understanding of what a healthy ecosystem looks like and what we have to do," said House, a 49-year-old Briton who has worked at Sony for more than two decades. "I think Yoshida coming in as CFO has been hugely beneficial for us. He comes from a network services business."

House said Sony's cloud-based TV service, due to launch in the United States this year, was an opportunity to expand the user base of its network services, now at 52 million - a fraction of Apple's 800 million or so iTunes users. Sony is also looking for more content providers after signing a deal with Viacom to stream 22 of its channels.

For some analysts, the contrasting fortunes of Sony's business pillars was not necessarily a bad thing.

"This has shown that a sensible CFO is able to control the expansionary aspirations of business heads, which if unchecked, would lead to larger losses for Sony," said Atul Goyal, analyst at Jefferies.

TOKYO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Sony Corp's game division head said he hopes the unit can raise its profit outlook for a second time this financial year as sales of the latest PlayStation console and subscription services for games and other content far exceed expectations.

Andrew House, chief executive officer of Sony Computer Entertainment, also told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that he was certain the game division would further increase its operating profit next year.

The division raised its operating profit outlook for the current year to next March to 25 billion yen ($230 million) from 20 billion when it last reported earnings in July.

Sony had sold more than 10 million PlayStation 4 game consoles as of Aug. 13.

House also said that Sony's cloud-based TV service, due to be launched in the United States before the end of the year, was an opportunity to expand the user base of its network services, now at 52 million, and that the firm was looking for more content providers after inking a deal with Viacom last week to stream 22 of its channels.

 Sony  Plans to Turn Game Division into Hub;  Sony  to Develop Service to Stream Games onto Phones, Tablets, Other Devices

CHIBA, Japan¡XFaced with deep losses in its electronics business that caused its stock to plunge Thursday, Sony Corp. is stepping up efforts to turn its better-performing game division into a hub for entertainment services.

Andrew House, chief executive of the game unit, said in an interview Thursday that his unit was talking with a range of potential content partners for a planned Internet television service that Sony intends to introduce in the U.S. by the end of the year. Sony last week disclosed details of one such agreement with Viacom Inc., under which it will be able to stream more than 20 channels, including MTV and Nickelodeon.

Mr. House said Sony also intended to develop a service to stream videogames onto smartphones, tablets and other devices from a range of manufacturers other than Sony.

"A streaming-based approach needs to have a very wide funnel of devices, and that inherently means a broad- and manufacturer-agnostic approach," said Mr. House, who was attending the Tokyo Game Show in this Tokyo suburb.

Since its introduction in November last year, Sony's $399 PlayStation 4 console is selling at the fastest pace on record for any Sony game console. After nine months, it sold 10 million units, far ahead of rivals from Microsoft Corp. and Nintendo Co.

"Sony has the potential to make the game console market its exclusive territory," said Eiichi Katayama, an analyst at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.

The growing ambitions for the game division mark a contrast with the electronics business, long the core of Sony but which has had various problems in recent years.

On Wednesday, Sony said it expected a ?230 billion ($2.12 billion) loss in the current fiscal year, driven mainly by a big write-down in its smartphone division where sales fell short of expectations. The disclosure, which came after the market close, pushed Sony shares down 8.6% in Tokyo trading Thursday.

Yasuo Nakane, an analyst at Deutsche Securities, described the move as an "extremely negative surprise," saying additional cuts might be needed. "We think the shape, scale and organizational structure of the (Sony headquarters) and sales company should be revised from scratch based on a downsizing of its core businesses," he wrote in a note to investors.

Sony surprised analysts in July when it reported a modest net profit for the April-June quarter, helped by its game unit's swing into the black. Its smartphone division posted a loss. Sony's Hollywood studio business and its finance arm have also been profit contributors recently.

Analysts say the PlayStation 4 makes it easy for third-party developers to create game software, meaning consumers have a good selection of titles. Sony this week made software to make game titles free of charge for the third-party developers to encourage further games.

At the four-day videogame trade show in the Makuhari Messe convention center outside Tokyo, attention focused on Sony's virtual reality headset, called Morpheus, which the company has been developing since 2011.

Like other such headsets, the Morpheus allows users to feel they are surrounded by the game environment. It also comes with a three-dimensional sound system, making sounds come from above, below and behind. And sensors on the hand-held controller give users the sensation of reaching out in various directions so that they can, say, feed a dinosaur in front of them.

The headset is initially aimed at heavy gamers, but Shuhei Yoshida, who is in charge of the project, said he hoped it would deliver "whole new experiences" for nongamers. He offered the example of a music lover who could don the headset to attend a virtual concert.

While Mr. House of the game unit said there had been no change in strategy for the division since the smartphone woes came to light, he acknowledged pressure to deliver results.

"As one of Sony's senior managers, I take very seriously the overall health of the company," Mr. House said. "My goal is to be absolutely focused on driving a very strong and profit-contributing and healthy ecosystem that can benefit Sony overall."

Sony hopes to leverage its game software to prop up its struggling smartphones. At a recent trade show in Berlin, Sony said its latest smartphone, the Xperia Z3, would come with a feature allowing users to play PlayStation 4 games remotely on the smartphone, if connected to Wi-Fi.

Mr. Katayama, the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch analyst, was cautious about how far the PlayStation 4 could reverse Sony's fortunes. "Games will no doubt be another source of stable earnings, but for a company with such diversified income streams as Sony, it would be wrong to portray games as a business that could support the company alone," he said.

Sept 19 (Reuters) - Following is a table highlighting this financial
year's assumed currency rates for some major Japanese firms and the impact
on annual operating profit of a 1 yen move lower against both the dollar
and the euro.
    The yen is currently trading at around 109 to the dollar, much weaker
than most companies had anticipated. The Japanese currency's rapid descent
to six-year lows against the greenback is starting to push beyond comfort
zones for three quarters of Japanese firms, a Reuters poll showed,
highlighting the potential for profits to be squeezed as import costs
climb.

Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Hit New Highs

MARKETS AT A GLANCE

(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)

SNAPSHOT

U.S. stocks rose, with the Dow industrials and S&P 500 hitting all-time highs, on relief over the latest Fed statement. The British pound hit a two-week high against the dollar ahead of the Scottish independence vote results. Treasurys finished mostly lower and the dollar hit a six-year high against the yen on worries over higher U.S. interest rates. Rate fears also caused gold futures to extend losses. Oil prices fell on the dollar's strength and as ample supplies weighed.

OPENING CALL

Big changes are afoot for the index that underlies the $5.9 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF. At the close of trading Friday, the ETF will transition to an index of 50 Hong-Kong listed stocks from 25. Rebecca Cheong, head of Americas equity derivatives strategy at UBS breaks down the differences, which are major. Financials' weighting in the index will fall by 9.4%, while consumer discretionary, utilities and industrials will roughly make up the difference, she says.

EQUITIES

The Dow industrials and S&P 500 rallied to all-time highs as investors were heartened by signals from the Federal Reserve that it remains on a measured course to eventually raise interest rates.

"If the pace of inflation remains contained, it is likely that the Fed will increase rates in a slow and methodical manner, which in our view presents a favorable backdrop for equities," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. An improving economy should lead to earnings growth and further stock gains this year, he said.

Financial stocks led the S&P 500 higher, with the sector posting a 1.1% gain.

"There's a relief rally here," said Steven Rosen, head of single-stock and ETF volatility trading at Soci?t? G?n?rale.

Investors also parsed mixed economic reports. Jobless claims fell by 36,000 to 280,000 in the week ended Sept. 13, well below the 305,000 level of claims expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The decline in claims marked the biggest drop in nearly two years.

Meanwhile, U.S. home construction dropped sharply in August. Housing starts fell 14.4% from July to an annual rate of 956,000 units, missing expectations for a 5.5% decline. Building permits also logged a bigger-than-expected decline, falling 5.6% in August.

Investors are also looking ahead to Alibaba Group Holding's initial public offering on Friday. Early investors will be able to sell more than $8 billion of shares, which is affecting how the offering is being priced.

In other corporate news, Rite Aid reported better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter, but lowered its outlook for the full year. Shares dropped nearly 19%.

ConAgra Foods shares rose 4.6% after the food company's adjusted per-share earnings beat expectations.

In Asian trading Thursday, stocks rose to an eight-month high in Tokyo but retreated in Hong Kong, with the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates and a weak Chinese property market in focus.

FOREX

The pound climbed to a two-week high against the dollar, as Scots headed to the polls to vote on separating from the U.K.

Most pre-election polls showed the pro-U.K. campaign narrowly in the lead despite a late surge by pro-independence voters last weekend. Most investors believe a vote against independence would benefit the pound. Although the currency fell by more than 6% from its July highs as the momentum for a referendum gathered, the U.K. economy has surged this year and investors expect the Bank of England to increase rates in 2015.

"The market is getting increasingly aggressive in the belief that we see a 'No' vote tonight," said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank, in a note to investors.

Meanwhile, the dollar rose to a new six-year high against the yen as investors continued to pile into the U.S. currency on expectations that the Federal Reserve is moving closer to raising interest rates.

BONDS

Yields on shorter-dated U.S. government bonds climbed to the highest levels in more than three years as worries over higher interest rates drove investors to cut holdings for a second day.

"The Federal Reserve is removing the punchbowl and it is time to be defensive" in your bond portfolio, said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Fla., which manages $2.25 billion in assets. "The bond market needs to adjust, which means higher yields."

Higher interest rates make newly sold bonds more attractive to buy, causing the value of existing bond prices to fall.

The bond market's selling over the past session has been led by shorter-dated notes. These yields have risen at a faster pace compared with longer-dated bonds since Fed officials on Wednesday afternoon forecast official rates to be at a higher level for the next two years compared with their projections in June.

Upbeat labor-market data added to anxiety. Initial claims for unemployment benefits posted the largest drop in nearly two years, a sign improvement in the labor market gained traction.

COMMODITIES

Oil futures fell as a strong dollar and higher U.S. supplies weighed on prices.

"The U.S. dollar seems to be the theme of the day," said Tim Evans, an analyst at Citi Futures Perspective. He summarized the market sentiment as: "Sell every commodity that you own, because the U.S. dollar strength is here to stay."

Gold prices extended their losses on as expectations of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve prompted some investors to cut back holdings of the store of value.

"While there is no definitive calendar date for an interest-rate rise, there was a clear statement to normalize policy," traders at TD Securities said in a note to clients.

Toshiba Accelerates PC Business Restructuring; Firm's PC Operations to Focus on Business-to-Business Field

TOKYO¡XToshiba Corp. on Thursday said it would accelerate the restructuring of its PC business to focus on the business-to-business field and would withdraw from certain consumer markets.

Hoping to reap the fruits of five years of cost-cutting this year, the Japanese company said it would reduce the size of its global workforce in the PC business by about 900 workers, which is 20% of its PC operations head count, excluding the manufacturing segment.

It will also cut fixed costs by more than ?20 billion versus the previous fiscal year ended in March and reduce the number of sales bases around the world to 13 in the current fiscal year from 32. The company didn't specify which consumer markets it would withdraw from.

Noting that its PC business reported positive operating income in the first quarter of this fiscal year, Toshiba said the cost of structural reforms would subtract ?45 billion ($415.24 million) from its operating profit and remove ?36 billion from its net profit. The company currently projects a ?330 billion operating profit and a ?120 billion net profit for this fiscal year.

"The PC market is expected to see a continuing trend to modest growth rates, and these transformation measures are necessary to support the business in securing consistent profit," Toshiba said in a statement.

Major Japanese electronics makers have undergone structural reforms in recent years to reorganize unprofitable businesses and to increase their global competitiveness. In July, Toshiba already announced a restructuring of its visual products business to focus more on Japan and rapidly growing emerging nations.

On Wednesday, Sony Corp. said that it expected its net loss for this fiscal year to balloon to ?230 billion as a result of an impairment charge connected to smartphones and acknowledged it wouldn't be a major player in the devices, which had been one of the company's last hopes for turning around its electronics arm.

 Sony  Shares Plunge After Earnings Warning;  Sony 's Share Price Fell Nearly 10% in Tokyo Morning Trading

TOKYO¡XSony Corp.'s share price plunged on Thursday after the company's said that it would post a loss of more than $2 billion in the current fiscal year and stop paying dividends.

The company's stock fell more than 10% at one point in the morning session on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dropping as low as ?1,844. Its shares ended down 8.6% at ?1,940.

The Japanese electronics giant announced after the market closed on Wednesday that it would take an impairment charge of ?180 billion connected to smartphones in the second quarter and acknowledged it wouldn't be a major player in the devices, which had been one of the company's last hopes for turning around its electronics arm.

As a result of the charge, Sony said it expected to post a net loss of ?230 billion in the fiscal year ending in March, almost five times what it forecast four months ago.

"The company had mentioned the possibility of impairment losses when it announced its April-June results, but its decision to book the losses at the top of the expected range is somewhat negative," said Yu Okazaki, an analyst at Nomura Securities.

Also hurting Sony shares on Thursday was the company's decision not to pay a dividend in the current fiscal year for the first time since the company's stock was listed in 1958.

The announcement was an "extremely negative surprise," said Yasuo Nakane, a research analyst for Deutsche Securities Inc. It will "weigh on the share price" in the near term, he said.

JPMorgan Securities' analysts also point out the move to skip dividend payouts may be highlighting worse-than-expected financial conditions.

"It is well known that dividends are a long-term commitment and we think this signals that its internal operations may be worse than what the market thinks," they said in a research note.

Meanwhile, the cost of credit protection for Sony increased to 165 basis points on Thursday, up sharply from around 110 basis points on Tuesday. Some market participants expect Sony's credit default swap price to remain high for the next few months while major credit-rating firms review the company's credit rating.

On Wednesday, Japan Credit Rating Agency said it placed Sony's credit rating under negative watch. Fitch Ratings said the write-down came as "no surprise" and wasn't likely to affect its rating.

Moody's has already assigned a junk rating to Sony's bonds, while Standard & Poor's on Thursday said it placed Sony's BBB- rating on credit monitor with negative implications.

Looking forward, analysts expect the company to need more structural changes.

"We think the shape, scale and organizational structure of the HQ and sales company should be revised from scratch based on a downsizing of its core businesses," Deutsche's Mr. Nakane said, adding that the company needs a slim business structure even if it incurs huge additional costs.

JPMorgan also warns specifically about the competitive smartphone business.

"Despite a write-down in the mobile communication segment, we do not rule out potential downside risk to its smartphone operations given commoditized high-end smartphones and intensifying competition in the mid-end segment," the brokerage's analysts said.

Corrections & Amplifications

Standard & Poor's has a BBB- rating credit rating for Sony. An earlier version of this article said it was a junk grade.
